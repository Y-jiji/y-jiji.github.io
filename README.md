## Work in Progress + Inelegant Stuff

- [ ] The title problem: displayed page tag is the link, no article title or site name. 
- [ ] The title problem: displayed title on `site/index.html` is specified in yaml front matter, which doesn't necessarily agree with H1 level title. 
- [ ] Portfolio Page: haven't figured out how to make a professional-alike portfolio page. 
- [ ] Archive: no css, not fully functioning. 
- [ ] Archive: implement fusion search. 
- [ ] Meta Scanner: no paging in meta data, which is bad.
