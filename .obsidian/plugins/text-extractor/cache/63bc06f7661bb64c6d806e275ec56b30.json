Bibliography .............................. 533 Index ................................... 539 This book was written to be a readable introduction to algebraic topology with rather broad coverage of the subject. The viewpoint is quite classical in spirit, and stays well within the conﬁnes of pure algebraic topology. In a sense, the book could have been written thirty or forty years ago since virtually everything in it is at least that old. However, the passage of the intervening years has helped clarify what are the most important results and techniques. For example, CW complexes have proved over time to be the most natural class of spaces for algebraic topology, so they are emphasized here much more than in the books of an earlier generation. This empha- sis also illustrates the book’s general slant towards geometric, rather than algebraic, aspects of the subject. The geometry of algebraic topology is so pretty, it would seem a pity to slight it and to miss all the intuition it provides. At the elementary level, algebraic topology separates naturally into the two broad channels of homology and homotopy. This material is here divided into four chap- ters, roughly according to increasing sophistication, with homotopy split between Chapters 1 and 4, and homology and its mirror variant cohomology in Chapters 2 and 3. These four chapters do not have to be read in this order, however. One could begin with homology and perhaps continue with cohomology before turning to ho- motopy. In the other direction, one could postpone homology and cohomology until after parts of Chapter 4. If this latter strategy is pushed to its natural limit, homology and cohomology can be developed just as branches of homotopy theory. Appealing as this approach is from a strictly logical point of view, it places more demands on the reader, and since readability is one of the ﬁrst priorities of the book, this homotopic interpretation of homology and cohomology is described only after the latter theories have been developed independently of homotopy theory. Preceding the four main chapters there is a preliminary Chapter 0 introducing some of the basic geometric concepts and constructions that play a central role in both the homological and homotopical sides of the subject. This can either be read before the other chapters or skipped and referred back to later for speciﬁc topics as they become needed in the subsequent chapters. Each of the four main chapters concludes with a selection of additional topics that the reader can sample at will, independent of the basic core of the book contained in the earlier parts of the chapters. Many of these extra topics are in fact rather important in the overall scheme of algebraic topology, though they might not ﬁt into the time x Preface constraints of a ﬁrst course. Altogether, these additional topics amount to nearly half the book, and they are included here both to make the book more comprehensive and to give the reader who takes the time to delve into them a more substantial sample of the true richness and beauty of the subject. Not included in this book is the important but somewhat more sophisticated topic of spectral sequences. It was very tempting to include something about this marvelous tool here, but spectral sequences are such a big topic that it seemed best to start with them afresh in a new volume. This is tentatively titled ‘Spectral Sequences in Algebraic Topology’ and is referred to herein as [SSAT]. There is also a third book in progress, on vector bundles, characteristic classes, and K–theory, which will be largely independent of [SSAT] and also of much of the present book. This is referred to as [VBKT], its provisional title being ‘Vector Bundles and K–Theory.’ In terms of prerequisites, the present book assumes the reader has some familiar- ity with the content of the standard undergraduate courses in algebra and point-set topology. In particular, the reader should know about quotient spaces, or identiﬁ- cation spaces as they are sometimes called, which are quite important for algebraic topology. Good sources for this concept are the textbooks [Armstrong 1983] and [J¨anich 1984] listed in the Bibliography. A book such as this one, whose aim is to present classical material from a rather classical viewpoint, is not the place to indulge in wild innovation. There is, however, one small novelty in the exposition that may be worth commenting upon, even though in the book as a whole it plays a relatively minor role. This is the use of what we call Ñ complexes, which are a mild generalization of the classical notion of a simplicial complex. The idea is to decompose a space into simplices allowing different faces of a simplex to coincide and dropping the requirement that simplices are uniquely de- termined by their vertices. For example, if one takes the standard picture of the torus as a square with opposite edges identiﬁed and divides the square into two triangles by cutting along a diagonal, then the result is a Ñ complex structure on the torus having 2 triangles, 3 edges, and 1 vertex. By contrast, a simplicial complex structure on the torus must have at least 14 triangles, 21 edges, and 7 vertices. So Ñ complexes provide a signiﬁcant improvement in efﬁciency, which is nice from a pedagogical view- point since it cuts down on tedious calculations in examples. A more fundamental reason for considering Ñ complexes is that they seem to be very natural objects from the viewpoint of algebraic topology. They are the natural domain of deﬁnition for simplicial homology, and a number of standard constructions produce Ñ complexes rather than simplicial complexes, for instance the singular complex of a space, or the classifying space of a discrete group or category. Historically, Ñ complexes were ﬁrst introduced by Eilenberg and Zilber in 1950 under the name of semisimplicial com- plexes. This term later came to mean something different, however, and the original notion seems to have been largely ignored since.

The aim of this short preliminary chapter is to introduce a few of the most com- mon geometric concepts and constructions in algebraic topology. The exposition is somewhat informal, with no theorems or proofs until the last couple pages, and it should be read in this informal spirit, skipping bits here and there. In fact, this whole chapter could be skipped now, to be referred back to later for basic deﬁnitions. To avoid overusing the word ‘continuous’ we adopt the convention that maps be- tween spaces are always assumed to be continuous unless otherwise stated. Homotopy and Homotopy Type One of the main ideas of algebraic topology is to consider two spaces to be equiv- alent if they have ‘the same shape’ in a sense that is much broader than homeo- morphism. To take an everyday example, the letters of the alphabet can be writ- ten either as unions of ﬁnitely many straight and curved line segments, or in thickened forms that are compact subsurfaces of the plane bounded by simple closed curves. In each case the thin letter is a subspace of the thick letter, and we can continuously shrink the thick letter to the thin one. A nice way to do this is to decompose a thick letter, call it X , into line segments connecting each point on the outer boundary of X to a unique point of the thin subletter X , as indi- cated in the ﬁgure. Then we can shrink X to X by sliding each point of X − X into X along the line segment that contains it. Points that are already in X do not move. We can think of this shrinking process as taking place during a time interval 0 \u0014 t \u0014 1 , and then it deﬁnes a family of functions ft : X!X parametrized by t 2 I … ƒ0; 1⁄ , where ft—x– is the point to which a given point x 2 X has moved at time t . 2 Chapter 0 Some Underlying Geometric Notions Naturally we would like ft—x– to depend continuously on both t and x , and this will be true if we have each x 2 X − X move along its line segment at constant speed so as to reach its image point in X at time t … 1 , while points x 2 X are stationary, as remarked earlier. Examples of this sort lead to the following general deﬁnition. A deformation retraction of a space X onto a subspace A is a family of maps ft : X!X , t 2 I , such that f0 … 11 (the identity map), f1—X– … A , and ft jj A … 11 for all t . The family ft should be continuous in the sense that the associated map X \u0002 I!X , —x; t– , ft—x– , is continuous. It is easy to produce many more examples similar to the letter examples, with the deformation retraction ft obtained by sliding along line segments. The ﬁgure on the left below shows such a deformation retraction of a M¨obius band onto its core circle. The three ﬁgures on the right show deformation retractions in which a disk with two smaller open subdisks removed shrinks to three different subspaces. In all these examples the structure that gives rise to the deformation retraction can be described by means of the following deﬁnition. For a map f : X!Y , the mapping cylinder Mf is the quotient space of the disjoint union —X \u0002 I– q Y obtained by iden- tifying each —x; 1– 2 X \u0002 I with f—x– 2 Y . In the let- X £ I X Y Y Mff X() ter examples, the space X is the outer boundary of the thick letter, Y is the thin letter, and f : X!Y sends the outer endpoint of each line segment to its inner endpoint. A similar description applies to the other examples. Then it is a general fact that a mapping cylinder Mf deformation retracts to the subspace Y by sliding each point —x; t– along the segment fxg\u0002 I ˆ Mf to the endpoint f—x– 2 Y . Not all deformation retractions arise in this way from mapping cylinders, how- ever. For example, the thick X deformation retracts to the thin X , which in turn deformation retracts to the point of intersection of its two crossbars. The net result is a deformation retraction of X onto a point, during which certain pairs of points follow paths that merge before reaching their ﬁnal destination. Later in this section we will describe a considerably more complicated example, the so-called ‘house with two rooms,’ where a deformation retraction to a point can be constructed abstractly, but seeing the deformation with the naked eye is a real challenge. Homotopy and Homotopy Type Chapter 0 3 A deformation retraction ft : X!X is a special case of the general notion of a homotopy, which is simply any family of maps ft : X!Y , t 2 I , such that the asso- ciated map F : X \u0002 I!Y given by F—x; t– … ft—x– is continuous. One says that two maps f0;f1 : X!Y are homotopic if there exists a homotopy ft connecting them, and one writes f0 ' f1 . In these terms, a deformation retraction of X onto a subspace A is a homotopy from the identity map of X to a retraction of X onto A , a map r : X!X such that r—X– … A and r jj A … 11 . One could equally well regard a retraction as a map X!A restricting to the identity on the subspace A ˆ X . From a more formal viewpoint a retraction is a map r : X!X with r 2 … r , since this equation says exactly that r is the identity on its image. Retractions are the topological analogs of projection operators in other parts of mathematics. Not all retractions come from deformation retractions. For example, a space X always retracts onto any point x0 2 X via the constant map sending all of X to x0 , but a space that deformation retracts onto a point must be path-connected since a deformation retraction of X to x0 gives a path joining each x 2 X to x0 . It is less trivial to show that there are path-connected spaces that do not deformation retract onto a point. One would expect this to be the case for the letters ‘with holes,’ A , B , D , O , P , Q , R . In Chapter 1 we will develop techniques to prove this. A homotopy ft : X!X that gives a deformation retraction of X onto a subspace A has the property that ft jj A … 11 for all t . In general, a homotopy ft : X!Y whose restriction to a subspace A ˆ X is independent of t is called a homotopy relative to A , or more concisely, a homotopy rel A . Thus, a deformation retraction of X onto A is a homotopy rel A from the identity map of X to a retraction of X onto A . If a space X deformation retracts onto a subspace A via ft : X!X , then if r : X!A denotes the resulting retraction and i : A!X the inclusion, we have ri … 11 and ir ' 11 , the latter homotopy being given by ft . Generalizing this situation, a map f : X!Y is called a homotopy equivalence if there is a map g : Y!X such that fg ' 11 and gf ' 11 . The spaces X and Y are said to be homotopy equivalent or to have the same homotopy type. The notation is X ' Y . It is an easy exercise to check that this is an equivalence relation, in contrast with the nonsymmetric notion of de- formation retraction. For example, the three graphs are all homotopy equivalent since they are deformation retracts of the same space, as we saw earlier, but none of the three is a deformation retract of any other. It is true in general that two spaces X and Y are homotopy equivalent if and only if there exists a third space Z containing both X and Y as deformation retracts. For the less trivial implication one can in fact take Z to be the mapping cylinder Mf of any homotopy equivalence f : X!Y . We observed previously that Mf deformation retracts to Y , so what needs to be proved is that Mf also deformation retracts to its other end X if f is a homotopy equivalence. This is shown in Corollary 0.21. 4 Chapter 0 Some Underlying Geometric Notions A space having the homotopy type of a point is called contractible. This amounts to requiring that the identity map of the space be nullhomotopic, that is, homotopic to a constant map. In general, this is slightly weaker than saying the space deforma- tion retracts to a point; see the exercises at the end of the chapter for an example distinguishing these two notions. Let us describe now an example of a 2 dimensional subspace of R 3 , known as the house with two rooms, which is contractible but not in any obvious way. To build this = [[ space, start with a box divided into two chambers by a horizontal rectangle, where by a ‘rectangle’ we mean not just the four edges of a rectangle but also its interior. Access to the two chambers from outside the box is provided by two vertical tunnels. The upper tunnel is made by punching out a square from the top of the box and another square directly below it from the middle horizontal rectangle, then inserting four vertical rectangles, the walls of the tunnel. This tunnel allows entry to the lower chamber from outside the box. The lower tunnel is formed in similar fashion, providing entry to the upper chamber. Finally, two vertical rectangles are inserted to form ‘support walls’ for the two tunnels. The resulting space X thus consists of three horizontal pieces homeomorphic to annuli plus all the vertical rectangles that form the walls of the two chambers. To see that X is contractible, consider a closed \" neighborhood N—X– of X . This clearly deformation retracts onto X if \" is sufﬁciently small. In fact, N—X– is the mapping cylinder of a map from the boundary surface of N—X– to X . Less obvious is the fact that N—X– is homeomorphic to D3 , the unit ball in R3 . To see this, imagine forming N—X– from a ball of clay by pushing a ﬁnger into the ball to create the upper tunnel, then gradually hollowing out the lower chamber, and similarly pushing a ﬁnger in to create the lower tunnel and hollowing out the upper chamber. Mathematically, this process gives a family of embeddings ht : D3!R 3 starting with the usual inclusion D3 > R 3 and ending with a homeomorphism onto N—X– . Thus we have X ' N—X– … D3 ' point ,so X is contractible since homotopy equivalence is an equivalence relation. In fact, X deformation retracts to a point. For if ft is a deformation retraction of the ball N—X– to a point x0 2 X and if r : N—X–!X is a retraction, for example the end result of a deformation retraction of N—X– to X , then the restriction of the composition rft to X is a deformation retraction of X to x0 . However, it is quite a challenging exercise to see exactly what this deformation retraction looks like. Cell Complexes Chapter 0 5 Cell Complexes A familiar way of constructing the torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 is by identifying opposite sides of a square. More generally, an orientable surface Mg of genus g can be constructed from a polygon with 4g sides by identifying pairs of edges, as shown in the ﬁgure in the ﬁrst three cases g … 1; 2; 3. The 4g edges of the polygon ab a a b b b b b b c a a a d a c c c c b d d dd e e f f a e f dc b a become a union of 2g circles in the surface, all intersect- ing in a single point. The in- terior of the polygon can be thought of as an open disk, or a 2 cell, attached to the union of the 2g circles. One can also regard the union of the circles as being obtained from their common point of intersection, by attaching 2g open arcs, or 1 cells. Thus the surface can be built up in stages: Start with a point, attach 1 cells to this point, then attach a 2 cell. A natural generalization of this is to construct a space by the following procedure: (1) Start with a discrete set X0 , whose points are regarded as 0 cells. (2) Inductively, form the n skeleton Xn from Xn−1 by attaching n cells en \u000b via maps '\u000b : S n−1!Xn−1 . This means that Xn is the quotient space of the disjoint union Xn−1` \u000b Dn \u000b of Xn−1 with a collection of n disks Dn \u000b under the identiﬁcations x ˘ '\u000b—x– for x 2 @Dn \u000b . Thus as a set, Xn … Xn−1` \u000b en \u000b where each en \u000b is an open n disk. (3) One can either stop this inductive process at a ﬁnite stage, setting X … Xn for some n< 1 , or one can continue indeﬁnitely, setting X … Sn Xn . In the latter case X is given the weak topology: A set A ˆ X is open (or closed) iff A \\ Xn is open (or closed) in Xn for each n . A space X constructed in this way is called a cell complex or CW complex. The explanation of the letters ‘CW’ is given in the Appendix, where a number of basic topological properties of cell complexes are proved. The reader who wonders about various point-set topological questions lurking in the background of the following discussion should consult the Appendix for details. 6 Chapter 0 Some Underlying Geometric Notions If X … Xn for some n , then X is said to be ﬁnite-dimensional, and the smallest such n is the dimension of X , the maximum dimension of cells of X . Example 0.1.A 1 dimensional cell complex X … X1 is what is called a graph in algebraic topology. It consists of vertices (the 0 cells) to which edges (the 1 cells) are attached. The two ends of an edge can be attached to the same vertex. Example 0.2. The house with two rooms, pictured earlier, has a visually obvious 2 dimensional cell complex structure. The 0 cells are the vertices where three or more of the depicted edges meet, and the 1 cells are the interiors of the edges connecting these vertices. This gives the 1 skeleton X1 , and the 2 cells are the components of the remainder of the space, X − X1 . If one counts up, one ﬁnds there are 29 0 cells, 51 1 cells, and 23 2 cells, with the alternating sum 29 − 51 ‡ 23 equal to 1 . This is the Euler characteristic, which for a cell complex with ﬁnitely many cells is deﬁned to be the number of even-dimensional cells minus the number of odd-dimensional cells. As we shall show in Theorem 2.44, the Euler characteristic of a cell complex depends only on its homotopy type, so the fact that the house with two rooms has the homotopy type of a point implies that its Euler characteristic must be 1, no matter how it is represented as a cell complex. Example 0.3. The sphere S n has the structure of a cell complex with just two cells, e0 and en , the n cell being attached by the constant map S n−1!e0 . This is equivalent to regarding S n as the quotient space Dn=@Dn . Example 0.4. Real projective n space RPn is deﬁned to be the space of all lines through the origin in Rn‡1 . Each such line is determined by a nonzero vector in R n‡1 , unique up to scalar multiplication, and RPn is topologized as the quotient space of Rn‡1 −f0g under the equivalence relation v ˘ \u0015v for scalars \u0015 ﬂ 0 . We can restrict to vectors of length 1, so RPn is also the quotient space S n=—v ˘−v– , the sphere with antipodal points identiﬁed. This is equivalent to saying that RPn is the quotient space of a hemisphere Dn with antipodal points of @Dn identiﬁed. Since @Dn with antipodal points identiﬁed is just RPn−1 , we see that RPn is obtained from RPn−1 by attaching an n cell, with the quotient projection S n−1!RPn−1 as the attaching map. It follows by induction on n that RPn has a cell complex structure e0 [ e1 [\u0001\u0001\u0001 [ en with one cell ei in each dimension i \u0014 n . Example 0.5. Since RPn is obtained from RPn−1 by attaching an n cell, the inﬁnite union RP1 … Sn RPn becomes a cell complex with one cell in each dimension. We can view RP1 as the space of lines through the origin in R 1 … S n R n . Example 0.6. Complex projective n space CPn is the space of complex lines through the origin in Cn‡1 , that is, 1 dimensional vector subspaces of C n‡1 . As in the case of RPn , each line is determined by a nonzero vector in C n‡1 , unique up to scalar multiplication, and CPn is topologized as the quotient space of C n‡1 −f0g under the Cell Complexes Chapter 0 7 equivalence relation v ˘ \u0015v for \u0015 ﬂ 0 . Equivalently, this is the quotient of the unit sphere S 2n‡1 ˆ C n‡1 with v ˘ \u0015v for j\u0015j… 1 . It is also possible to obtain CPn as a quotient space of the disk D2n under the identiﬁcations v ˘ \u0015v for v 2 @D2n , in the following way. The vectors in S 2n‡1 ˆ C n‡1 with last coordinate real and nonnegative are precisely the vectors of the form —w; p1 −jwj2 – 2 C n \u0002 C with jwj\u0014 1 . Such vectors form the graph of the function w , p 1 −jwj2 . This is a disk D2n ‡ bounded by the sphere S 2n−1 ˆ S 2n‡1 consisting of vectors —w; 0– 2 C n \u0002 C with jwj… 1 . Each vector in S 2n‡1 is equivalent under the identiﬁcations v ˘ \u0015v to a vector in D2n ‡ , and the latter vector is unique if its last coordinate is nonzero. If the last coordinate is zero, we have just the identiﬁcations v ˘ \u0015v for v 2 S 2n−1 . From this description of CPn as the quotient of D2n ‡ under the identiﬁcations v ˘ \u0015v for v 2 S 2n−1 it follows that CPn is obtained from CPn−1 by attaching a cell e2n via the quotient map S 2n−1!CPn−1 . So by induction on n we obtain a cell structure CPn … e0 [ e2 [ \u0001\u0001\u0001 [ e2n with cells only in even dimensions. Similarly, CP1 has a cell structure with one cell in each even dimension. After these examples we return now to general theory. Each cell en \u000b in a cell complex X has a characteristic map Ø\u000b : Dn \u000b!X which extends the attaching map '\u000b and is a homeomorphism from the interior of Dn \u000b onto en \u000b . Namely, we can take Ø\u000b to be the composition Dn \u000b > Xn−1` \u000b Dn \u000b!Xn > X where the middle map is the quotient map deﬁning Xn . For example, in the canonical cell structure on S n described in Example 0.3, a characteristic map for the n cell is the quotient map Dn!S n collapsing @Dn to a point. For RPn a characteristic map for the cell ei is the quotient map Di!RPi ˆ RPn identifying antipodal points of @Di , and similarly for CPn . A subcomplex of a cell complex X is a closed subspace A ˆ X that is a union of cells of X . Since A is closed, the characteristic map of each cell in A has image contained in A , and in particular the image of the attaching map of each cell in A is contained in A ,so A is a cell complex in its own right. A pair —X; A– consisting of a cell complex X and a subcomplex A will be called a CW pair. For example, each skeleton Xn of a cell complex X is a subcomplex. Particular cases of this are the subcomplexes RPk ˆ RPn and CPk ˆ CPn for k \u0014 n . These are in fact the only subcomplexes of RPn and CPn . There are natural inclusions S 0 ˆ S 1 ˆ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ˆ S n , but these subspheres are not subcomplexes of S n in its usual cell structure with just two cells. However, we can give S n a different cell structure in which each of the subspheres S k is a subcomplex, by regarding each S k as being obtained inductively from the equatorial S k−1 by attaching two k cells, the components of S k−S k−1 . The inﬁnite-dimensional sphere S 1 … S n S n then becomes a cell complex as well. Note that the two-to-one quotient map S 1!RP1 that identiﬁes antipodal points of S 1 identiﬁes the two n cells of S 1 to the single n cell of RP1 . 8 Chapter 0 Some Underlying Geometric Notions In the examples of cell complexes given so far, the closure of each cell is a sub- complex, and more generally the closure of any collection of cells is a subcomplex. Most naturally arising cell structures have this property, but it need not hold in gen- eral. For example, if we start with S 1 with its minimal cell structure and attach to this a2 cell by a map S 1!S 1 whose image is a nontrivial subarc of S 1 , then the closure of the 2 cell is not a subcomplex since it contains only a part of the 1 cell. Operations on Spaces Cell complexes have a very nice mixture of rigidity and ﬂexibility, with enough rigidity to allow many arguments to proceed in a combinatorial cell-by-cell fashion and enough ﬂexibility to allow many natural constructions to be performed on them. Here are some of those constructions. Products.If X and Y are cell complexes, then X \u0002 Y has the structure of a cell complex with cells the products em \u000b \u0002 en \f where em \u000b ranges over the cells of X and en \f ranges over the cells of Y . For example, the cell structure on the torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 described at the beginning of this section is obtained in this way from the standard cell structure on S 1 . For completely general CW complexes X and Y there is one small complication: The topology on X \u0002 Y as a cell complex is sometimes ﬁner than the product topology, with more open sets than the product topology has, though the two topologies coincide if either X or Y has only ﬁnitely many cells, or if both X and Y have countably many cells. This is explained in the Appendix. In practice this subtle issue of point-set topology rarely causes problems, however. Quotients.If —X; A– is a CW pair consisting of a cell complex X and a subcomplex A , then the quotient space X=A inherits a natural cell complex structure from X . The cells of X=A are the cells of X − A plus one new 0 cell, the image of A in X=A . For a cell en \u000b of X − A attached by '\u000b : S n−1!Xn−1 , the attaching map for the correspond- ing cell in X=A is the composition S n−1!Xn−1!Xn−1=A n−1 . For example, if we give S n−1 any cell structure and build Dn from S n−1 by attach- ing an n cell, then the quotient Dn=S n−1 is S n with its usual cell structure. As another example, take X to be a closed orientable surface with the cell structure described at the beginning of this section, with a single 2 cell, and let A be the complement of this 2 cell, the 1 skeleton of X . Then X=A has a cell structure consisting of a 0 cell with a2 cell attached, and there is only one way to attach a cell to a 0 cell, by the constant map, so X=A is S 2 . Suspension. For a space X , the suspension SX is the quotient of X \u0002 I obtained by collapsing X \u0002f0g to one point and X \u0002f1g to an- other point. The motivating example is X … Sn , when SX … S n‡1 with the two ‘suspension points’ at the north and south poles of S n‡1 , the points —0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 0; \u00061– . One can regard SX as a double cone Operations on Spaces Chapter 0 9 on X , the union of two copies of the cone CX … —X \u0002 I–=—X \u0002f0g– .If X is a CW com- plex, so are SX and CX as quotients of X \u0002 I with its product cell structure, I being given the standard cell structure of two 0 cells joined by a 1 cell. Suspension becomes increasingly important the farther one goes into algebraic topology, though why this should be so is certainly not evident in advance. One especially useful property of suspension is that not only spaces but also maps can be suspended. Namely, a map f : X!Y suspends to Sf : SX!SY , the quotient map of f \u0002 11: X \u0002 I!Y \u0002 I . Join. The cone CX is the union of all line segments joining points of X to an external vertex, and similarly the suspension SX is the union of all line segments joining points of X to two external vertices. More generally, given X and a second space Y , one can deﬁne the space of all lines segments joining points in X to points in Y . This is the join X \u0003 Y , the quotient space of X \u0002 Y \u0002 I under the identiﬁcations —x; y1; 0– ˘ —x; y2; 0– and —x1;y; 1– ˘ —x2;y; 1– . Thus we are collapsing the subspace X \u0002 Y \u0002f0g to X and X \u0002 Y \u0002f1g to Y . For example, if X and Y are both closed intervals, then we are collapsing two opposite faces of a cube onto line segments so that the cube becomes a tetrahedron. In the general case, X \u0003 Y X I Y contains copies of X and Y at its two ‘ends,’ and every other point —x;y;t– in X \u0003 Y is on a unique line segment joining the point x 2 X ˆ X \u0003 Y to the point y 2 Y ˆ X \u0003 Y , the segment obtained by ﬁxing x and y and letting the coordinate t in —x;y;t– vary. A nice way to write points of X \u0003 Y is as formal linear combinations t1x ‡ t2y with 0 \u0014 ti \u0014 1 and t1 ‡t2 … 1 , subject to the rules 0x ‡1y … y and 1x ‡0y … x that correspond exactly to the identiﬁcations deﬁning X \u0003 Y . In much the same way, an iterated join X1 \u0003 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0003 Xn can be regarded as the space of formal linear combinations t1x1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ tnxn with 0 \u0014 ti \u0014 1 and t1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ tn … 1 , with the convention that terms 0ti can be omitted. This viewpoint makes it easy to see that the join operation is associative. A very special case that plays a central role in algebraic topology is when each Xi is just a point. For example, the join of two points is a line segment, the join of three points is a triangle, and the join of four points is a tetrahedron. The join of n points is a convex polyhedron of dimension n − 1 called a simplex. Concretely, if the n points are the n standard basis vectors for R n , then their join is the space Ñn−1 …f —t1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;tn– 2 R n jj t1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ tn … 1 and ti \u0015 0 g . Another interesting example is when each Xi is S 0 , two points. If we take the two points of Xi to be the two unit vectors along the ith coordinate axis in R n , then the join X1 \u0003\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0003 Xn is the union of 2 n copies of the simplex Ñ n−1 , and radial projection from the origin gives a homeomorphism between X1 \u0003\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0003 Xn and S n−1 . 10 Chapter 0 Some Underlying Geometric Notions If X and Y are CW complexes, then there is a natural CW structure on X \u0003 Y having the subspaces X and Y as subcomplexes, with the remaining cells being the product cells of X \u0002 Y \u0002 —0; 1– . As usual with products, the CW topology on X \u0003 Y may be weaker than the quotient of the product topology on X \u0002 Y \u0002 I . Wedge Sum. This is a rather trivial but still quite useful operation. Given spaces X and Y with chosen points x0 2 X and y0 2 Y , then the wedge sum X _ Y is the quotient of the disjoint union X q Y obtained by identifying x0 and y0 to a single point. For example, S 1 _ S 1 is homeomorphic to the ﬁgure ‘8,’ two circles touching at a point. More generally one could form the wedge sum W \u000b X\u000b of an arbitrary collection of spaces X\u000b by starting with the disjoint union ` \u000b X\u000b and identifying points x\u000b 2 X\u000b to a single point. In case the spaces X\u000b are cell complexes and the points x\u000b are 0 cells, then W \u000b X\u000b is a cell complex since it is obtained from the cell complex ` \u000b X\u000b by collapsing a subcomplex to a point. For any cell complex X , the quotient Xn=Xn−1 is a wedge sum of n spheres W \u000b S n \u000b , with one sphere for each n cell of X . Smash Product. Like suspension, this is another construction whose importance be- comes evident only later. Inside a product space X \u0002 Y there are copies of X and Y , namely X \u0002fy0g and fx0g\u0002 Y for points x0 2 X and y0 2 Y . These two copies of X and Y in X \u0002 Y intersect only at the point —x0;y0– , so their union can be identiﬁed with the wedge sum X _ Y . The smash product X ^ Y is then deﬁned to be the quo- tient X \u0002 Y=X _ Y . One can think of X ^ Y as a reduced version of X \u0002 Y obtained by collapsing away the parts that are not genuinely a product, the separate factors X and Y . The smash product X ^ Y is a cell complex if X and Y are cell complexes with x0 and y0 0 cells, assuming that we give X \u0002 Y the cell-complex topology rather than the product topology in cases when these two topologies differ. For example, Sm ^S n has a cell structure with just two cells, of dimensions 0 and m‡n , hence S m ^S n … S m‡n . In particular, when m … n … 1 we see that collapsing longitude and meridian circles of a torus to a point produces a 2 sphere. Two Criteria for Homotopy Equivalence Earlier in this chapter the main tool we used for constructing homotopy equiva- lences was the fact that a mapping cylinder deformation retracts onto its ‘target’ end. By repeated application of this fact one can often produce homotopy equivalences be- tween rather different-looking spaces. However, this process can be a bit cumbersome in practice, so it is useful to have other techniques available as well. We will describe two commonly used methods here. The ﬁrst involves collapsing certain subspaces to points, and the second involves varying the way in which the parts of a space are put together. Two Criteria for Homotopy Equivalence Chapter 0 11 Collapsing Subspaces The operation of collapsing a subspace to a point usually has a drastic effect on homotopy type, but one might hope that if the subspace being collapsed already has the homotopy type of a point, then collapsing it to a point might not change the homotopy type of the whole space. Here is a positive result in this direction: If —X; A– is a CW pair consisting of a CW complex X and a contractible subcomplex A , then the quotient map X!X=A is a homotopy equivalence. A proof will be given later in Proposition 0.17, but for now let us look at some examples showing how this result can be applied. Example 0.7: Graphs. The three graphs are homotopy equivalent since each is a deformation retract of a disk with two holes, but we can also deduce this from the collapsing criterion above since collapsing the middle edge of the ﬁrst and third graphs produces the second graph. More generally, suppose X is any graph with ﬁnitely many vertices and edges. If the two endpoints of any edge of X are distinct, we can collapse this edge to a point, producing a homotopy equivalent graph with one fewer edge. This simpliﬁcation can be repeated until all edges of X are loops, and then each component of X is either an isolated vertex or a wedge sum of circles. This raises the question of whether two such graphs, having only one vertex in each component, can be homotopy equivalent if they are not in fact just isomorphic graphs. Exercise 12 at the end of the chapter reduces the question to the case of connected graphs. Then the task is to prove that a wedge sum W m S 1 of m circles is not homotopy equivalent to W n S 1 if m ﬂ n . This sort of thing is hard to do directly. What one would like is some sort of algebraic object associated to spaces, depending only on their homotopy type, and taking different values for W m S 1 and W n S 1 if m ﬂ n .In fact the Euler characteristic does this since W m S 1 has Euler characteristic 1−m . But it is a rather nontrivial theorem that the Euler characteristic of a space depends only on its homotopy type. A different algebraic invariant that works equally well for graphs, and whose rigorous development requires less effort than the Euler characteristic, is the fundamental group of a space, the subject of Chapter 1. Example 0.8. Consider the space X obtained from S 2 by attaching the two ends of an arc A to two distinct points on the sphere, say the north and south poles. Let B be an arc in S 2 joining the two points where A attaches. Then X can be given a CW complex structure with the two endpoints of A and B as 0 cells, the interiors of A and B as 1 cells, and the rest of S 2 as a 2 cell. Since A and B are contractible, A X X= X= B A B 12 Chapter 0 Some Underlying Geometric Notions X=A and X=B are homotopy equivalent to X . The space X=A is the quotient S 2=S 0 , the sphere with two points identiﬁed, and X=B is S 1 _ S 2 . Hence S 2=S 0 and S 1 _ S 2 are homotopy equivalent, a fact which may not be entirely obvious at ﬁrst glance. Example 0.9. Let X be the union of a torus with n meridional disks. To obtain a CW structure on X , choose a longitudinal circle in the torus, intersecting each of the meridional disks in one point. These intersection points are then the 0 cells, the 1 cells are the rest of the longitudinal circle and the boundary circles of the meridional disks, and the 2 cells are the remaining regions of the torus and the interiors of the meridional disks. Collapsing each meridional disk to a point yields a homotopy X Y Z W equivalent space Y consisting of n 2 spheres, each tangent to its two neighbors, a ‘necklace with n beads.’ The third space Z in the ﬁgure, a strand of n beads with a string joining its two ends, collapses to Y by collapsing the string to a point, so this collapse is a homotopy equivalence. Finally, by collapsing the arc in Z formed by the front halves of the equators of the n beads, we obtain the fourth space W , a wedge sum of S 1 with n 2 spheres. (One can see why a wedge sum is sometimes called a ‘bouquet’ in the older literature.) Example 0.10: Reduced Suspension. Let X be a CW complex and x0 2 X a0 cell. Inside the suspension SX we have the line segment fx0g\u0002 I , and collapsing this to a point yields a space ÖX homotopy equivalent to SX , called the reduced suspension of X . For example, if we take X to be S 1 _ S 1 with x0 the intersection point of the two circles, then the ordinary suspension SX is the union of two spheres intersecting along the arc fx0g\u0002 I , so the reduced suspension ÖX is S 2 _ S 2 , a slightly simpler space. More generally we have Ö—X _ Y– … ÖX _ ÖY for arbitrary CW complexes X and Y . Another way in which the reduced suspension ÖX is slightly simpler than SX is in its CW structure. In SX there are two 0 cells (the two suspension points) and an —n ‡ 1– cell en \u0002 —0; 1– for each n cell en of X , whereas in ÖX there is a single 0 cell and an —n ‡ 1– cell for each n cell of X other than the 0 cell x0 . The reduced suspension ÖX is actually the same as the smash product X ^ S 1 since both spaces are the quotient of X \u0002 I with X \u0002 @I [fx0g\u0002 I collapsed to a point. Attaching Spaces Another common way to change a space without changing its homotopy type in- volves the idea of continuously varying how its parts are attached together. A general deﬁnition of ‘attaching one space to another’ that includes the case of attaching cells Two Criteria for Homotopy Equivalence Chapter 0 13 is the following. We start with a space X0 and another space X1 that we wish to attach to X0 by identifying the points in a subspace A ˆ X1 with points of X0 . The data needed to do this is a map f : A!X0 , for then we can form a quotient space of X0 q X1 by identifying each point a 2 A with its image f —a– 2 X0 . Let us de- note this quotient space by X0 tf X1 , the space X0 with X1 attached along A via f . When —X1;A– … —Dn;S n−1– we have the case of attaching an n cell to X0 via a map f : S n−1!X0 . Mapping cylinders are examples of this construction, since the mapping cylinder Mf of a map f : X!Y is the space obtained from Y by attaching X \u0002 I along X \u0002f1g via f . Closely related to the mapping cylinder Mf is the mapping cone Cf … Y tf CX where CX is the cone —X \u0002 I–=—X \u0002f0g– and we attach this to Y along X \u0002f1g via the identiﬁcations —x; 1– ˘ f—x– . For exam- ple, when X is a sphere S n−1 the mapping cone Cf is the space obtained from Y by attaching an n cell via f : S n−1!Y .A mapping cone Cf can also be viewed as the quotient Mf =X of the mapping cylinder Mf with the subspace X … X \u0002f0g collapsed to a point. CX Y If one varies an attaching map f by a homotopy ft , one gets a family of spaces whose shape is undergoing a continuous change, it would seem, and one might expect these spaces all to have the same homotopy type. This is often the case: If —X1;A– is a CW pair and the two attaching maps f; g : A!X0 are homotopic, then X0 tf X1 ' X0 tg X1 . Again let us defer the proof and look at some examples. Example 0.11. Let us rederive the result in Example 0.8 that a sphere with two points A S 1 S 2 identiﬁed is homotopy equivalent to S 1 _ S 2 . The sphere with two points identiﬁed can be obtained by attaching S 2 to S 1 by a map that wraps a closed arc A in S 2 around S 1 , as shown in the ﬁgure. Since A is contractible, this attach- ing map is homotopic to a constant map, and attaching S 2 to S 1 via a constant map of A yields S 1 _ S 2 . The result then follows since —S 2;A– is a CW pair, S 2 being obtained from A by attaching a 2 cell. Example 0.12. In similar fashion we can see that the necklace in Example 0.9 is homotopy equivalent to the wedge sum of a circle with n 2 spheres. The necklace can be obtained from a circle by attaching n 2 spheres along arcs, so the necklace is homotopy equivalent to the space obtained by attaching n 2 spheres to a circle at points. Then we can slide these attaching points around the circle until they all coincide, producing the wedge sum. Example 0.13. Here is an application of the earlier fact that collapsing a contractible subcomplex is a homotopy equivalence: If —X; A– is a CW pair, consisting of a cell 14 Chapter 0 Some Underlying Geometric Notions complex X and a subcomplex A , then X=A ' X [ CA , the mapping cone of the inclusion A>X . For we have X=A … —X[CA–=CA ' X[CA since CA is a contractible subcomplex of X [ CA . Example 0.14.If —X; A– is a CW pair and A is contractible in X , that is, the inclusion A> X is homotopic to a constant map, then X=A ' X _ SA . Namely, by the previous example we have X=A ' X [ CA , and then since A is contractible in X , the mapping cone X [ CA of the inclusion A > X is homotopy equivalent to the mapping cone of a constant map, which is X _ SA . For example, S n=S i ' S n _ S i‡1 for i<n , since S i is contractible in S n if i<n . In particular this gives S 2=S 0 ' S 2 _ S 1 , which is Example 0.8 again. The Homotopy Extension Property In this ﬁnal section of the chapter we will actually prove a few things. In partic- ular we prove the two criteria for homotopy equivalence described above, along with the fact that any two homotopy equivalent spaces can be embedded as deformation retracts of the same space. The proofs depend upon a technical property that arises in many other contexts as well. Consider the following problem. Suppose one is given a map f0 : X!Y , and on a subspace A ˆ X one is also given a homotopy ft : A!Y of f0 jj A that one would like to extend to a homotopy ft : X!Y of the given f0 . If the pair —X; A– is such that this extension problem can always be solved, one says that —X; A– has the homotopy extension property. Thus —X; A– has the homotopy extension property if every map X \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I!Y can be extended to a map X \u0002 I!Y . In particular, the homotopy extension property for —X; A– implies that the iden- tity map X \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I!X \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I extends to a map X \u0002 I!X \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I ,so X \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I is a retract of X \u0002 I . The converse is also true: If there is a retraction X \u0002 I!X \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I , then by composing with this retraction we can extend every map X \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I!Y to a map X \u0002 I!Y . Thus the homotopy extension property for —X; A– is equivalent to X \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I being a retract of X \u0002 I . This implies for ex- ample that if —X; A– has the homotopy extension property, then so does —X \u0002 Z; A\u0002 Z– for any space Z , a fact that would not be so easy to prove directly from the deﬁnition. If —X; A– has the homotopy extension property, then A must be a closed subspace of X , at least when X is Hausdorff. For if r : X \u0002 I!X \u0002 I is a retraction onto the subspace X \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I , then the image of r is the set of points z 2 X \u0002 I with r—z– … z , a closed set if X is Hausdorff, so X \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I is closed in X \u0002 I and hence A is closed in X . A simple example of a pair —X; A– with A closed for which the homotopy exten- sion property fails is the pair —I; A– where A …f0; 1;1=2;1=3;1=4; \u0001\u0001\u0001g. It is not hard to show that there is no continuous retraction I \u0002 I!I \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I . The breakdown of homotopy extension here can be attributed to the bad structure of —X; A– near 0 . The Homotopy Extension Property Chapter 0 15 With nicer local structure the homotopy extension property does hold, as the next example shows. Example 0.15. A pair —X; A– has the homotopy extension property if A has a map- ping cylinder neighborhood in X , by which we mean a closed neighborhood N containing a subspace B , thought of as the boundary of N , with N − B an open neighborhood of A , such that there exists a map f : B!A and a homeomorphism h : Mf !N with h jj A [ B … 11 . Mapping cylinder neighbor- X A B N hoods like this occur fairly often. For example, the thick let- ters discussed at the beginning of the chapter provide such neighborhoods of the thin letters, regarded as subspaces of the plane. To verify the homotopy extension property, notice ﬁrst that I \u0002 I retracts onto I \u0002f0g[@I \u0002 I , hence B \u0002 I \u0002 I retracts onto B \u0002 I \u0002f0g[ B \u0002 @I \u0002 I , and this retraction induces a retraction of Mf \u0002 I onto Mf \u0002f0g[ —A [ B–\u0002 I . Thus —Mf ;A [ B– has the homotopy exten- sion property. Hence so does the homeomorphic pair —N; A [ B– . Now given a map X!Y and a homotopy of its restriction to A , we can take the constant homotopy on X − —N − B– and then extend over N by applying the homotopy extension property for —N; A [ B– to the given homotopy on A and the constant homotopy on B . Proposition 0.16. If —X; A– is a CW pair, then X \u0002f0g[A\u0002 I is a deformation retract of X \u0002 I , hence —X; A– has the homotopy extension property. Proof: There is a retraction r : Dn \u0002 I!Dn \u0002f0g[ @Dn \u0002 I , for ex- ample the radial projection from the point —0; 2– 2 Dn \u0002 R . Then setting rt … tr ‡ —1 − t–11 gives a deformation retraction of Dn \u0002 I onto Dn \u0002f0g[ @Dn \u0002 I . This deformation retraction gives rise to a deformation retraction of Xn \u0002 I onto Xn \u0002f0g[ —Xn−1 [ An–\u0002 I since Xn \u0002 I is obtained from Xn \u0002f0g[ —Xn−1 [ An–\u0002 I by attach- ing copies of Dn \u0002 I along Dn \u0002f0g[ @Dn \u0002 I . If we perform the deformation retrac- tion of Xn \u0002 I onto Xn \u0002f0g[ —Xn−1 [ An–\u0002 I during the t interval ƒ1=2 n‡1; 1=2 n⁄ , this inﬁnite concatenation of homotopies is a deformation retraction of X \u0002 I onto X \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I . There is no problem with continuity of this deformation retraction at t … 0 since it is continuous on Xn \u0002 I , being stationary there during the t interval ƒ0; 1=2n‡1⁄ , and CW complexes have the weak topology with respect to their skeleta so a map is continuous iff its restriction to each skeleton is continuous. tu Now we can prove a generalization of the earlier assertion that collapsing a con- tractible subcomplex is a homotopy equivalence. Proposition 0.17. If the pair —X; A– satisﬁes the homotopy extension property and A is contractible, then the quotient map q : X!X=A is a homotopy equivalence. 16 Chapter 0 Some Underlying Geometric Notions Proof: Let ft : X!X be a homotopy extending a contraction of A , with f0 … 11 . Since ft—A– ˆ A for all t , the composition qft : X!X=A sends A to a point and hence fac- tors as a composition X q -----! X=A!X=A . Denoting the latter map by f t : X=A!X=A , we have qft … f tq in the ﬁrst of the two diagrams at the right. When t … 1 we have X X/ X A X/A q q f t f t X X/ X A X/A q g q f 1 f 1 ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡ f1—A– equal to a point, the point to which A contracts, so f1 induces a map g : X=A!X with gq … f1 , as in the second diagram. It follows that qg … f 1 since qg—x– … qgq—x– … qf1—x– … f 1q—x– … f 1—x– . The maps g and q are inverse homotopy equivalences since gq … f1 ' f0 … 11 via ft and qg … f 1 ' f 0 … 11 via f t . tu Another application of the homotopy extension property, giving a slightly more reﬁned version of one of our earlier criteria for homotopy equivalence, is the following: Proposition 0.18. If —X1;A– is a CW pair and we have attaching maps f; g : A!X0 that are homotopic, then X0 tf X1 ' X0 tg X1 rel X0 . Here the deﬁnition of W ' Z rel Y for pairs —W ; Y – and —Z; Y – is that there are maps ' : W!Z and : Z!W restricting to the identity on Y , such that ' ' 11 and ' ' 11 via homotopies that restrict to the identity on Y at all times. Proof:If F : A\u0002 I!X0 is a homotopy from f to g , consider the space X0 tF —X1 \u0002 I– . This contains both X0 tf X1 and X0 tg X1 as subspaces. A deformation retraction of X1 \u0002 I onto X1 \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I as in Proposition 0.16 induces a deformation retraction of X0 tF —X1 \u0002 I– onto X0 tf X1 . Similarly X0 tF —X1 \u0002 I– deformation retracts onto X0tg X1 . Both these deformation retractions restrict to the identity on X0 , so together they give a homotopy equivalence X0 tf X1 ' X0 tg X1 rel X0 . tu We ﬁnish this chapter with a technical result whose proof will involve several applications of the homotopy extension property: Proposition 0.19. Suppose —X; A– and —Y ; A– satisfy the homotopy extension prop- erty, and f : X!Y is a homotopy equivalence with f jj A … 11 . Then f is a homotopy equivalence rel A . Corollary 0.20. If —X; A– satisﬁes the homotopy extension property and the inclusion A > X is a homotopy equivalence, then A is a deformation retract of X . Proof: Apply the proposition to the inclusion A > X . tu Corollary 0.21. A map f : X!Y is a homotopy equivalence iff X is a deformation retract of the mapping cylinder Mf . Hence, two spaces X and Y are homotopy equivalent iff there is a third space containing both X and Y as deformation retracts. The Homotopy Extension Property Chapter 0 17 Proof: In the diagram at the right the maps i and j are the inclu- sions and r is the canonical retraction, so f … ri and i ' jf . Since¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! f j rX Y fMi j and r are homotopy equivalences, it follows that f is a homotopy equivalence iff i is a homotopy equivalence, since the composition of two homotopy equivalences is a homotopy equivalence and a map homotopic to a homotopy equivalence is a homotopy equivalence. Now apply the preceding corollary to the pair —Mf ;X– , which satisﬁes the homotopy extension property by Example 0.15 using the neighborhood X \u0002 ƒ0; 1=2⁄ of X in Mf . tu Proof of 0.19: Let g : Y!X be a homotopy inverse for f . There will be three steps to the proof: (1) Construct a homotopy from g to a map g1 with g1 jj A … 11. (2) Show g1f ' 11 rel A . (3) Show fg1 ' 11 rel A . (1) Let ht : X!X be a homotopy from gf … h0 to 11 … h1 . Since f jj A … 11, we can view ht jj A as a homotopy from g jj A to 11 . Then since we assume —Y ; A– has the homotopy extension property, we can extend this homotopy to a homotopy gt : Y!X from g … g0 to a map g1 with g1 jj A … 11. (2) A homotopy from g1f to 11 is given by the formulas kt … ( g1−2tf; 0 \u0014 t \u0014 1=2 h2t−1; 1=2 \u0014 t \u0014 1 Note that the two deﬁnitions agree when t … 1=2. Since f jj A … 11 and gt … ht on A , the homotopy kt jj A starts and ends with the identity, and its second half simply re- traces its ﬁrst half, that is, kt … k1−t on A . We will deﬁne a ‘homotopy of homotopies’ ktu : A!X by means of the ﬁgure at the right showing the param- gf gf1 11 eter domain I \u0002 I for the pairs —t; u– , with the t axis horizontal and the u axis vertical. On the bottom edge of the square we de- ﬁne kt0 … kt jj A . Below the ‘V’ we deﬁne ktu to be independent of u , and above the ‘V’ we deﬁne ktu to be independent of t . This is unambiguous since kt … k1−t on A . Since k0 … 11on A , we have ktu … 11 for —t; u– in the left, right, and top edges of the square. Next we extend ktu over X , as follows. Since —X; A– has the homotopy extension property, so does —X \u0002 I; A\u0002 I– by a remark in the paragraph following the deﬁnition of the ho- motopy extension property. Viewing ktu as a homotopy of kt jj A , we can therefore extend ktu : A!X to ktu : X!X with kt0 … kt . If we restrict this ktu to the left, top, and right edges of the —t; u– square, we get a homotopy g1f ' 11 rel A . (3) Since g1 ' g , we have fg1 ' fg ' 11, so fg1 ' 11 and steps (1) and (2) can be repeated with the pair f; g replaced by g1;f . The result is a map f1 : X!Y with f1 jj A … 11 and f1g1 ' 11 rel A . Hence f1 ' f1—g1f– … —f1g1–f ' f rel A . From this we deduce that fg1 ' f1g1 ' 11 rel A . tu 18 Chapter 0 Some Underlying Geometric Notions Exercises 1.

Most often these algebraic images are groups, but more elaborate structures such as rings, modules, and algebras also arise. The mechanisms that create these images — the ‘lanterns’ of algebraic topology, one might say — are known formally as functors and have the characteristic feature that they form images not only of spaces but also of maps. Thus, continuous maps between spaces are projected onto homomorphisms between their algebraic images, so topo- logically related spaces have algebraically related images. With suitably constructed lanterns one might hope to be able to form images with enough detail to reconstruct accurately the shapes of all spaces, or at least of large and interesting classes of spaces. This is one of the main goals of algebraic topology, and to a surprising extent this goal is achieved. Of course, the lanterns necessary to do this are somewhat complicated pieces of machinery. But this machinery also has a certain intrinsic beauty. This ﬁrst chapter introduces one of the simplest and most important functors of algebraic topology, the fundamental group, which creates an algebraic image of a space from the loops in the space, the paths in the space starting and ending at the same point. The Idea of the Fundamental Group To get a feeling for what the fundamental group is about, let us look at a few preliminary examples before giving the formal deﬁnitions. 22 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group Consider two linked circles A and B in R3 , as shown in the ﬁgure. Our experience with actual links and chains A B tells us that since the two circles are linked, it is impossi- ble to separate B from A by any continuous motion of B , such as pushing, pulling, or twisting. We could even take B to be made of rubber or stretchable string and allow completely general continu- ous deformations of B , staying in the complement of A at all times, and it would still be impossible to pull B off A . At least that is what intuition suggests, and the fundamental group will give a way of making this intuition mathematically rigorous. Instead of having B link with A just once, we could make it link with A two or more times, as in the ﬁgures to the right. As a further variation, by assigning an orientation to B A A B¡3 B 2 we can speak of B linking A a positive or a negative number of times, say positive when B comes forward through A and negative for the reverse direction. Thus for each nonzero integer n we have an oriented circle Bn linking An times, where by ‘circle’ we mean a curve homeomorphic to a circle. To complete the scheme, we could let B0 be a circle not linked to A at all. Now, integers not only measure quantity, but they form a group under addition. Can the group operation be mimicked geometrically with some sort of addition op- eration on the oriented circles B linking A ? An oriented circle B can be thought of as a path traversed in time, starting and ending at the same point x0 , which we can choose to be any point on the circle. Such a path starting and ending at the same point is called a loop. Two different loops B and B0 both starting and end- ing at the same point x0 can be ‘added’ to form a new loop B ‡ B0 that travels ﬁrst around B , then around B0 . For example, if B1 and B0 1 are loops each linking A once in A B1 B1 x 0 A B2 x 0 0 A B1 x 0 A B0 x 0 B¡1 the positive direction, then their sum B1 ‡ B0 1 is deformable to B2 , linking A twice. Simi- larly, B1 ‡ B−1 can be deformed to the loop B0 , unlinked from A . More generally, we see that Bm ‡ Bn can be deformed to Bm‡n for arbitrary integers m and n . Note that in forming sums of loops we produce loops that pass through the base- point more than once. This is one reason why loops are deﬁned merely as continuous The Idea of the Fundamental Group 23 paths, which are allowed to pass through the same point many times. So if one is thinking of a loop as something made of stretchable string, one has to give the string the magical power of being able to pass through itself unharmed. However, we must be sure not to allow our loops to intersect the ﬁxed circle A at any time, otherwise we could always unlink them from A . Next we consider a slightly more complicated sort of linking, involving three cir- cles forming a conﬁguration known as the Borromean rings, shown at the left in the ﬁg- ure below. The interesting feature here is that if any one of the three circles is removed, the other two are not linked. In the same A A B B C C spirit as before, let us regard one of the cir- cles, say C , as a loop in the complement of the other two, A and B , and we ask whether C can be continuously deformed to unlink it completely from A and B , always staying in the complement of A and B during the deformation. We can redraw the picture by pulling A and B apart, dragging C along, and then we see C winding back and forth between A and B as shown in the second ﬁgure above. In this new position, if we start at the point of C indicated by the dot and proceed in the direction given by the arrow, then we pass in sequence: (1) forward through A , (2) forward through B , (3) backward through A , and (4) backward through B .If we measure the linking of C with A and B by two integers, then the ‘forwards’ and ‘backwards’ cancel and both integers are zero. This reﬂects the fact that C is not linked with A or B individually. To get a more accurate measure of how C links with A and B together, we re- gard the four parts (1)–(4) of C as an ordered sequence. Taking into account the directions in which these segments of C pass through A and B , we may deform C to the sum a ‡ b − a − b of four loops as in the ﬁgure. We A B a b ¡b¡a A B a b ¡b¡a write the third and fourth loops as the nega- tives of the ﬁrst two since they can be deformed to the ﬁrst two, but with the opposite orienta- tions, and as we saw in the preceding exam- ple, the sum of two oppositely oriented loops is deformable to a trivial loop, not linked with anything. We would like to view the expression a ‡ b − a − b as lying in a nonabelian group, so that it is not automatically zero. Changing to the more usual multiplicative notation for nonabelian groups, it would be written aba−1b−1 , the commutator of a and b . 24 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group To shed further light on this example, suppose we modify it slightly so that the cir- cles A and B are now linked, as in the next ﬁgure. The circle C can then be deformed A B C A B C into the position shown at the right, where it again rep- resents the composite loop aba −1b−1 , where a and b are loops linking A and B . But from the picture on the left it is apparent that C can actually be unlinked completely from A and B . So in this case the product aba −1b−1 should be trivial. The fundamental group of a space X will be deﬁned so that its elements are loops in X starting and ending at a ﬁxed basepoint x0 2 X , but two such loops are regarded as determining the same element of the fundamental group if one loop can be continuously deformed to the other within the space X . (All loops that occur during deformations must also start and end at x0 .) In the ﬁrst example above, X is the complement of the circle A , while in the other two examples X is the complement of the two circles A and B . In the second section in this chapter we will show: The fundamental group of the complement of the circle A in the ﬁrst example is inﬁnite cyclic with the loop B as a generator. This amounts to saying that every loop in the complement of A can be deformed to one of the loops Bn , and that Bn cannot be deformed to Bm if n ﬂ m . The fundamental group of the complement of the two unlinked circles A and B in the second example is the nonabelian free group on two generators, represented by the loops a and b linking A and B . In particular, the commutator aba −1b−1 is a nontrivial element of this group. The fundamental group of the complement of the two linked circles A and B in the third example is the free abelian group on two generators, represented by the loops a and b linking A and B . As a result of these calculations, we have two ways to tell when a pair of circles A and B is linked. The direct approach is given by the ﬁrst example, where one circle is regarded as an element of the fundamental group of the complement of the other circle. An alternative and somewhat more subtle method is given by the second and third examples, where one distinguishes a pair of linked circles from a pair of unlinked circles by the fundamental group of their complement, which is abelian in one case and nonabelian in the other. This method is much more general: One can often show that two spaces are not homeomorphic by showing that their fundamental groups are not isomorphic, since it will be an easy consequence of the deﬁnition of the fundamental group that homeomorphic spaces have isomorphic fundamental groups. Basic Constructions Section 1.1 25 This ﬁrst section begins with the basic deﬁnitions and constructions, and then proceeds quickly to an important calculation, the fundamental group of the circle, using notions developed more fully in x1.3. More systematic methods of calculation are given in x1.2. These are sufﬁcient to show for example that every group is realized as the fundamental group of some space. This idea is exploited in the Additional Topics at the end of the chapter, which give some illustrations of how algebraic facts about groups can be derived topologically, such as the fact that every subgroup of a free group is free. Paths and Homotopy The fundamental group will be deﬁned in terms of loops and deformations of loops. Sometimes it will be useful to consider more generally paths and their defor- mations, so we begin with this slight extra generality. By a path in a space X we mean a continuous map f : I!X where I is the unit interval ƒ0; 1⁄ . The idea of continuously deforming a path, keeping its endpoints ﬁxed, is made precise by the following deﬁnition. A homotopy of paths in X is a family ft : I!X ,0 \u0014 t \u0014 1 , such that (1) The endpoints ft—0– … x0 and ft—1– … x1 are independent of t . x1 1 x0 0f f (2) The associated map F : I \u0002 I!X deﬁned by F—s; t– … ft—s– is continuous. When two paths f0 and f1 are connected in this way by a homotopy ft , they are said to be homotopic. The notation for this is f0 ' f1 . Example 1.1: Linear Homotopies. Any two paths f0 and f1 in R n having the same endpoints x0 and x1 are homotopic via the homotopy ft—s– … —1 − t–f0—s– ‡ tf1—s– . During this homotopy each point f0—s– travels along the line segment to f1—s– at con- stant speed. This is because the line through f0—s– and f1—s– is linearly parametrized as f0—s– ‡ tƒf1—s– − f0—s–⁄ … —1 − t–f0—s– ‡ tf1—s– , with the segment from f0—s– to f1—s– covered by t values in the interval from 0 to 1 . If f1—s– happens to equal f0—s– then this segment degenerates to a point and ft—s– … f0—s– for all t . This occurs in particular for s … 0 and s … 1 , so each ft is a path from x0 to x1 . Continuity of the homotopy ft as a map I \u0002 I!R n follows from continuity of f0 and f1 since the algebraic operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication in the formula for ft are continuous. This construction shows more generally that for a convex subspace X ˆ R n , all paths in X with given endpoints x0 and x1 are homotopic, since if f0 and f1 lie in X then so does the homotopy ft . 26 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group Before proceeding further we need to verify a technical property: Proposition 1.2. The relation of homotopy on paths with ﬁxed endpoints in any space is an equivalence relation. The equivalence class of a path f under the equivalence relation of homotopy will be denoted ƒf ⁄ and called the homotopy class of f . Proof: Reﬂexivity is evident since f ' f by the constant homotopy ft … f . Symmetry is also easy since if f0 ' f1 via ft , then f1 ' f0 via the inverse homotopy f1−t . For transitivity, if f0 ' f1 via ft and if f1 … g0 with g0 ' g1 via gt , then f0 ' g1 via the homotopy ht that equals f2t for 0 \u0014 t \u0014 1=2 and g2t−1 for 1=2 \u0014 t \u0014 1. These two deﬁnitions 0f 1g 1f 0g agree for t … 1=2 since we assume f1 … g0 . Continuity of the associated map H—s; t– … ht—s– comes from the elementary fact, which will be used frequently without explicit mention, that a function deﬁned on the union of two closed sets is continuous if it is continuous when restricted to each of the closed sets separately. In the case at hand we have H—s; t– … F—s; 2t– for 0 \u0014 t \u0014 1=2 and H—s; t– … G—s; 2t − 1– for 1=2 \u0014 t \u0014 1 where F and G are the maps I \u0002 I!X associated to the homotopies ft and gt . Since H is continuous on I \u0002 ƒ0; 1=2⁄ and on I \u0002 ƒ1=2; 1⁄, it is continuous on I \u0002 I . tu Given two paths f; g : I!X such that f—1– … g—0– , there is a composition or product path f g that traverses ﬁrst f and then g , deﬁned by the formula f g—s– … ( f—2s–; 0 \u0014 s \u0014 1=2 g—2s − 1–; 1=2 \u0014 s \u0014 1 Thus f and g are traversed twice as fast in order for f g to be traversed in unit time. This product operation respects homotopy classes since if f0 ' f1 and g0 ' g1 via homotopies ft and gt , and if f0—1– … g0—0– so that f0 g0 is deﬁned, then ft gt 0f 1g1f 0g is deﬁned and provides a homotopy f0 g0 ' f1 g1 . In particular, suppose we restrict attention to paths f : I!X with the same start- ing and ending point f—0– … f—1– … x0 2 X . Such paths are called loops, and the common starting and ending point x0 is referred to as the basepoint. The set of all homotopy classes ƒf ⁄ of loops f : I!X at the basepoint x0 is denoted ˇ1—X; x0– . Proposition 1.3. ˇ1—X; x0– is a group with respect to the product ƒf ⁄ƒg⁄ … ƒf g⁄ . This group is called the fundamental group of X at the basepoint x0 .We will see in Chapter 4 that ˇ1—X; x0– is the ﬁrst in a sequence of groups ˇn—X; x0– , called homotopy groups, which are deﬁned in an entirely analogous fashion using the n dimensional cube In in place of I . Basic Constructions Section 1.1 27 Proof: By restricting attention to loops with a ﬁxed basepoint x0 2 X we guarantee that the product f g of any two such loops is deﬁned. We have already observed that the homotopy class of f g depends only on the homotopy classes of f and g , so the product ƒf ⁄ƒg⁄ … ƒf g⁄ is well-deﬁned. It remains to verify the three axioms for a group. As a preliminary step, deﬁne a reparametrization of a path f to be a composi- tion f' where ' : I!I is any continuous map such that '—0– … 0 and '—1– … 1. Reparametrizing a path preserves its homotopy class since f' ' f via the homotopy f't where 't—s– … —1 − t–'—s– ‡ ts so that '0 … ' and '1—s– … s . Note that —1 − t–'—s– ‡ ts lies between '—s– and s , hence is in I , so the composition f't is deﬁned. If we are given paths f; g; h with f—1– … g—0– and g—1– … h—0– , then both prod- ucts —f g– h and f —g h– are deﬁned, and f —g h– is a reparametrization of —f g– h by the piecewise linear function ' whose graph is shown in the ﬁgure at the right. Hence —f g– h ' f —g h– . Restricting atten- tion to loops at the basepoint x0 , this says the product in ˇ1—X; x0– is associative. Given a path f : I!X , let c be the constant path at f—1– , deﬁned by c—s– … f—1– for all s 2 I . Then f c is a reparametrization of f via the function ' whose graph is shown in the ﬁrst ﬁgure at the right, so f c ' f . Similarly, c f ' f where c is now the constant path at f—0– , using the reparametrization function in the second ﬁgure. Taking f to be a loop, we deduce that the homotopy class of the constant path at x0 is a two-sided identity in ˇ1—X; x0– . For a path f from x0 to x1 , the inverse path f from x1 back to x0 is deﬁned by f—s– … f—1 − s– . To see that f f is homotopic to a constant path we use the homotopy ht … ft gt where ft is the path that equals f on the interval ƒ0; 1 − t⁄ and that is stationary at f—1 − t– on the interval ƒ1 − t; 1⁄ , and gt is the inverse path of ft . We could also describe ht in terms of the associated function H : I \u0002 I!X using the decomposition of I \u0002 I shown in the ﬁgure. On the bottom edge of the square H is given by f f and below the ‘V’ we let H—s; t– be independent of t , while above the ‘V’ we let H—s; t– be independent of s . Going back to the ﬁrst description of ht , we see that since f0 … f and f1 is the constant path c at x0 , ht is a homotopy from f f to c c … c . Replacing f by f gives f f ' c for c the constant path at x1 . Taking f to be a loop at the basepoint x0 , we deduce that ƒ f⁄ is a two-sided inverse for ƒf ⁄ in ˇ1—X; x0– . tu Example 1.4. For a convex set X in R n with basepoint x0 2 X we have ˇ1—X; x0– … 0, the trivial group, since any two loops f0 and f1 based at x0 are homotopic via the linear homotopy ft—s– … —1 − t–f0—s– ‡ tf1—s– , as described in Example 1.1. 28 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group It is not so easy to show that a space has a nontrivial fundamental group since one must somehow demonstrate the nonexistence of homotopies between certain loops. We will tackle the simplest example shortly, computing the fundamental group of the circle. It is natural to ask about the dependence of ˇ1—X; x0– on the choice of the base- point x0 . Since ˇ1—X; x0– involves only the path-component of X containing x0 ,it is clear that we can hope to ﬁnd a relation between ˇ1—X; x0– and ˇ1—X; x1– for two basepoints x0 and x1 only if x0 and x1 lie in the same path-component of X .So let h : I!X be a path from x0 to x1 , with the inverse path h—s– … h—1 − s– from x1 back to x0 . We can then associate x 1x0 h fto each loop f based at x1 the loop h f h based at x0 . Strictly speaking, we should choose an order of forming the product h f h , either —h f– h or h —f h– , but the two choices are homotopic and we are only interested in homotopy classes here. Alternatively, to avoid any ambiguity we could deﬁne a gen- eral n fold product f1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 fn in which the path fi is traversed in the time interval \u0002 i−1 n ; i n \u0003 . Proposition 1.5. The map \fh : ˇ1—X; x1–!ˇ1—X; x0– deﬁned by \fhƒf ⁄ … ƒh f h⁄ is an isomorphism. Proof:If ft is a homotopy of loops based at x1 then h ft h is a homotopy of loops based at x0 ,so \fh is well-deﬁned. Further, \fh is a homomorphism since \fhƒf g⁄ … ƒh f g h⁄ … ƒh f h h g h⁄ … \fhƒf ⁄\fhƒg⁄ . Finally, \fh is an isomorphism with inverse \fh since \fh\fhƒf ⁄ … \fhƒh f h⁄ … ƒh h f h h⁄ … ƒf ⁄ , and similarly \fh\fhƒf ⁄ … ƒf ⁄ . tu Thus if X is path-connected, the group ˇ1—X; x0– is, up to isomorphism, inde- pendent of the choice of basepoint x0 . In this case the notation ˇ1—X; x0– is often abbreviated to ˇ1—X– , or one could go further and write just ˇ1X . In general, a space is called simply-connected if it is path-connected and has trivial fundamental group. The following result explains the name. Proposition 1.6. A space X is simply-connected iff there is a unique homotopy class of paths connecting any two points in X . Proof: Path-connectedness is the existence of paths connecting every pair of points, so we need be concerned only with the uniqueness of connecting paths. Suppose ˇ1—X– … 0. If f and g are two paths from x0 to x1 , then f ' f g g ' g since the loops g g and f g are each homotopic to constant loops, using the assumption ˇ1—X; x0– … 0 in the latter case. Conversely, if there is only one homotopy class of paths connecting a basepoint x0 to itself, then all loops at x0 are homotopic to the constant loop and ˇ1—X; x0– … 0. tu Basic Constructions Section 1.1 29 The Fundamental Group of the Circle Our ﬁrst real theorem will be the calculation ˇ1—S 1– ˇ Z . Besides its intrinsic interest, this basic result will have several immediate applications of some substance, and it will be the starting point for many more calculations in the next section. It should be no surprise then that the proof will involve some genuine work. To max- imize the payoff for this work, the proof is written so that its main technical steps apply in the more general setting of covering spaces, the main topic of x1.3. Theorem 1.7. The map Ø : Z!ˇ1—S 1– sending an integer n to the homotopy class of the loop !n—s– … —cos 2ˇns; sin 2ˇns– based at —1; 0– is an isomorphism. Proof: The idea is to compare paths in S 1 with paths in R via the map p : R!S 1 given by p—s– … —cos 2ˇs; sin 2ˇs– . This map can be visu- alized geometrically by embedding R in R 3 as the helix parametrized by s , —cos 2ˇs; sin 2ˇs; s– , and then p is the restriction to the he- lix of the projection of R 3 onto R 2 , —x;y;z– , —x; y– , asinthe ﬁgure. Observe that the loop !n is the composition pf!n where p f!n : I!R is the path f!n—s– … ns , starting at 0 and ending at n , winding around the helix jnj times, upward if n> 0 and downward if n< 0 . The relation !n … pf!n is expressed by saying that f!n is a lift of !n . The deﬁnition of Ø can be reformulated by setting Ø—n– equal to the homotopy class of the loop p ef for ef any path in R from 0 to n . Such an ef is homotopic to f!n via the linear homotopy —1 − t– ef ‡ tf!n , hence p ef is homotopic to pf!n … !n and the new deﬁnition of Ø—n– agrees with the old one. To verify that Ø is a homomorphism, let ˝m : R!R be the translation ˝m—x– … x ‡ m . Then f!m —˝m f!n– is a path in R from 0 to m ‡ n ,so Ø—m ‡ n– is the homotopy class of the loop in S 1 that is the image of this path under p . This image is just !m !n ,so Ø—m ‡ n– … Ø—m– Ø—n– . To show that Ø is an isomorphism we shall use two facts: (a) For each path f : I!S 1 starting at a point x0 2 S 1 and each ex0 2 p−1—x0– there is a unique lift ef : I!R starting at ex0 . (b) For each homotopy ft : I!S 1 of paths starting at x0 and each ex0 2 p−1—x0– there is a unique lifted homotopy eft : I!R of paths starting at ex0 . Before proving these facts, let us see how they imply the theorem. To show that Ø is surjective, let f : I!S 1 be a loop at the basepoint —1; 0– , representing a given element of ˇ1—S 1– . By (a) there is a lift ef starting at 0 . This path ef ends at some integer n since p ef—1– … f—1– … —1; 0– and p−1—1; 0– … Z ˆ R . By the extended deﬁnition of Ø we then have Ø—n– … ƒp ef⁄ … ƒf ⁄ . Hence Ø is surjective. 30 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group To show that Ø is injective, suppose Ø—m– … Ø—n– , which means !m ' !n . Let ft be a homotopy from !m … f0 to !n … f1 . By (b) this homotopy lifts to a homotopy eft of paths starting at 0 . The uniqueness part of (a) implies that ef0 … f!m and ef1 … f!n . Since eft is a homotopy of paths, the endpoint eft—1– is independent of t . For t … 0 this endpoint is m and for t … 1it is n ,so m … n . It remains to prove (a) and (b). Both statements can be deduced from a more general assertion: (c) Given a map F : Y \u0002 I!S 1 and a map eF : Y \u0002f0g!R lifting F jY \u0002f0g , then there is a unique map eF : Y \u0002 I!R lifting F and restricting to the given eF on Y \u0002f0g . Statement (a) is the special case that Y is a point, and (b) is obtained by applying (c) with Y … I in the following way. The homotopy ft in (b) gives a map F : I \u0002 I!S 1 by setting F—s; t– … ft—s– as usual. A unique lift eF : I \u0002f0g!R is obtained by an application of (a). Then (c) gives a unique lift eF : I \u0002 I!R . The restrictions eF jf0g\u0002 I and eF jf1g\u0002 I are paths lifting constant paths, hence they must also be constant by the uniqueness part of (a). So eft—s– … eF—s; t– is a homotopy of paths, and eft lifts ft since p eF … F . We shall prove (c) using just one special property of the projection p : R!S 1 , namely: —\u0003– There is an open cover fU\u000bg of S 1 such that for each \u000b , p−1—U\u000b– can be decomposed as a disjoint union of open sets each of which is mapped homeo- morphically onto U\u000b by p . For example, we could take the cover fU\u000bg to consist of any two open arcs in S 1 whose union is S 1 . To prove (c) we will ﬁrst construct a lift eF : N \u0002 I!R for N some neighborhood in Y of a given point y0 2 Y . Since F is continuous, every point —y0;t– 2 Y \u0002 I has a product neighborhood Nt \u0002 —at;bt– such that F ( Nt \u0002 —at;bt–\u0001 ˆ U\u000b for some \u000b . By compactness of fy0g\u0002 I , ﬁnitely many such products Nt \u0002 —at;bt– cover fy0g\u0002 I . This implies that we can choose a single neighborhood N of y0 and a partition 0 … t0 <t1 < \u0001\u0001\u0001 <tm … 1of I so that for each i , F—N \u0002 ƒti;ti‡1⁄– is contained in some U\u000b , which we denote Ui . Assume inductively that eF has been constructed on N \u0002 ƒ0;ti⁄ . We have F—N \u0002 ƒti;ti‡1⁄– ˆ Ui ,so by —\u0003– there is an open set eUi ˆ R projecting homeomorphically onto Ui by p and containing the point eF—y0;ti– . After replacing N by a smaller neighborhood of y0 we may assume that eF—N \u0002ftig– is con- tained in eUi , namely, replace N \u0002ftig by its intersection with — eF jj N \u0002ftig– −1— eUi– . Now we can deﬁne eF on N \u0002 ƒti;ti‡1⁄ to be the composition of F with the homeomorphism p−1 : Ui! eUi . After ﬁnitely many repetitions of this induction step we eventually get a lift eF : N \u0002 I!R for some neighborhood N of y0 . Next we show the uniqueness part of (c) in the special case that Y is a point. In this case we can omit Y from the notation. So suppose eF and eF 0 are two lifts of F : I!S 1 Basic Constructions Section 1.1 31 such that eF—0– … eF 0 —0– . As before, choose a partition 0 … t0 <t1 < \u0001\u0001\u0001 <tm … 1of I so that for each i , F —ƒti;ti‡1⁄– is contained in some Ui . Assume inductively that eF … eF 0 on ƒ0;ti⁄ . Since ƒti;ti‡1⁄ is connected, so is eF —ƒti;ti‡1⁄– , which must therefore lie in a single one of the disjoint open sets eUi projecting homeomorphically to Ui as in —\u0003– . By the same token, eF 0 —ƒti;ti‡1⁄– lies in a single eUi , in fact in the same one that contains eF —ƒti;ti‡1⁄– since eF 0 —ti– … eF—ti– . Because p is injective on eUi and p eF … p eF 0 , it follows that eF … eF 0 on ƒti;ti‡1⁄ , and the induction step is ﬁnished. The last step in the proof of (c) is to observe that since the eF ’s constructed above on sets of the form N \u0002 I are unique when restricted to each segment fyg\u0002 I , they must agree whenever two such sets N \u0002 I overlap. So we obtain a well-deﬁned lift eF on all of Y \u0002 I . This eF is continuous since it is continuous on each N \u0002 I , and it is unique since it is unique on each segment fyg\u0002 I . tu Now we turn to some applications of this theorem. Although algebraic topology is usually ‘algebra serving topology,’ the roles are reversed in the following proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Theorem 1.8. Every nonconstant polynomial with coefﬁcients in C has a root in C . Proof: We may assume the polynomial is of the form p—z– … zn ‡ a1zn−1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ an . If p—z– has no roots in C , then for each real number r \u0015 0 the formula fr —s– … p—r e2ˇis–=p—r – jp—r e2ˇis–=p—r –j deﬁnes a loop in the unit circle S 1 ˆ C based at 1 . As r varies, fr is a homotopy of loops based at 1 . Since f0 is the trivial loop, we deduce that the class ƒfr ⁄ 2 ˇ1—S 1– is zero for all r . Now ﬁx a large value of r , bigger than ja1j‡\u0001\u0001\u0001‡janj and bigger than 1 . Then for jzj… r we have jznj… r n … r \u0001 r n−1 >—ja1j‡\u0001\u0001\u0001‡janj–jzn−1j\u0015ja1zn−1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ anj From the inequality jznj > ja1zn−1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ anj it follows that the polynomial pt—z– … zn ‡t—a1zn−1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001‡an– has no roots on the circle jzj… r when 0 \u0014 t \u0014 1 . Replacing p by pt in the formula for fr above and letting t go from 1 to 0 , we obtain a homo- topy from the loop fr to the loop !n—s– … e2ˇ ins . By Theorem 1.7, !n represents n times a generator of the inﬁnite cyclic group ˇ1—S 1– . Since we have shown that ƒ!n⁄ … ƒfr ⁄ … 0 , we conclude that n … 0 . Thus the only polynomials without roots in C are constants. tu Our next application is the Brouwer ﬁxed point theorem in dimension 2 . Theorem 1.9. Every continuous map h : D2!D2 has a ﬁxed point, that is, a point x with h—x– … x . Here we are using the standard notation Dn for the closed unit disk in R n , all vectors x of length jxj\u0014 1 . Thus the boundary of Dn is the unit sphere S n−1 . 32 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group Proof: Suppose on the contrary that h—x– ﬂ x for all x 2 D2 . Then we can deﬁne a map r : D2!S 1 by letting r—x– be the point of S 1 where the ray in R 2 starting at h—x– and passing through x leaves D2 . Continuity of r is clear since small per- x r—x– h—x– turbations of x produce small perturbations of h—x– , hence also small perturbations of the ray through these two points. The crucial property of r , besides continuity, is that r—x– … x if x 2 S1 . Thus r is a retraction of D2 onto S 1 . We will show that no such retraction can exist. Let f0 be any loop in S 1 .In D2 there is a homotopy of f0 to a constant loop, for example the linear homotopy ft—s– … —1 − t–f0—s– ‡ tx0 where x0 is the basepoint of f0 . Since the retraction r is the identity on S 1 , the composition rft is then a homotopy in S 1 from rf0 … f0 to the constant loop at x0 . But this contradicts the fact that ˇ1—S 1– is nonzero. tu This theorem was ﬁrst proved by Brouwer around 1910, one of the early triumphs of algebraic topology. Brouwer in fact proved the corresponding result for Dn , and we shall obtain this generalization in Corollary 2.11 using homology groups in place of ˇ1 . One could also use the higher homotopy group ˇn . Brouwer’s original proof used neither homology nor homotopy groups, which had not been invented at the time. Instead it used the notion of degree for maps S n!S n , which we shall deﬁne in x2.2 using homology but which Brouwer deﬁned directly in more geometric terms. These proofs are all arguments by contradiction, and so they show just the exis- tence of ﬁxed points without giving any clue as to how to ﬁnd one in explicit cases. Our proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra was similar in this regard. There exist other proofs of the Brouwer ﬁxed point theorem that are somewhat more con- structive, for example the elegant and quite elementary proof by Sperner in 1928, which is explained very nicely in [Aigner-Ziegler 1999]. The techniques used to calculate ˇ1—S 1– can be applied to prove the Borsuk–Ulam theorem in dimension two: Theorem 1.10. For every continuous map f : S 2!R 2 there exists a pair of antipodal points x and −x in S 2 with f—x– … f—−x– . It may be that there is only one such pair of antipodal points x , −x , for example if f is simply orthogonal projection of the standard sphere S 2 ˆ R 3 onto a plane. The Borsuk–Ulam theorem holds also for maps S n!Rn , as we show in Proposi- tion 2B.6. The proof for n … 1 is easy since the difference f—x– − f—−x– changes sign as x goes halfway around the circle, hence this difference must be zero for some x . For n \u0015 2 the theorem is certainly less obvious. Is it apparent, for example, that at every instant there must be a pair of antipodal points on the surface of the earth having the same temperature and the same barometric pressure? Basic Constructions Section 1.1 33 The theorem says in particular that there is no one-to-one continuous map from S 2 to R 2 ,so S 2 is not homeomorphic to a subspace of R 2 , an intuitively obvious fact that is not easy to prove directly. Proof: If the conclusion is false for f : S 2!R 2 , we can deﬁne a map g : S 2!S 1 by g—x– … ( f—x– − f—−x–\u0001 =jf—x– − f—−x–j . Deﬁne a loop \u0011 circling the equator of S 2 ˆ R 3 by \u0011—s– … —cos 2ˇs; sin 2ˇs; 0– , and let h : I!S 1 be the composed loop g\u0011 . Since g—−x– …−g—x– , we have the relation h—s ‡ 1=2– …−h—s– for all s in the interval ƒ0; 1=2⁄. As we showed in the calculation of ˇ1—S 1– , the loop h can be lifted to a path eh : I!R . The equation h—s ‡ 1=2– …−h—s– implies that eh—s ‡ 1=2– … eh—s– ‡ q=2 for some odd integer q that might conceivably depend on s 2 ƒ0; 1=2⁄. But in fact q is independent of s since by solving the equation eh—s ‡ 1=2– … eh—s–‡ q=2 for q we see that q depends continuously on s 2 ƒ0; 1=2⁄,so q must be a constant since it is constrained to integer values. In particular, we have eh—1– … eh—1=2– ‡ q=2 … eh—0– ‡ q. This means that h represents q times a generator of ˇ1—S 1– . Since q is odd, we conclude that h is not nullhomotopic. But h was the composition g\u0011 : I!S 2!S 1 , and \u0011 is obviously nullhomotopic in S 2 ,so g\u0011 is nullhomotopic in S 1 by composing a nullhomotopy of \u0011 with g . Thus we have arrived at a contradiction. tu Corollary 1.11. Whenever S 2 is expressed as the union of three closed sets A1 , A2 , and A3 , then at least one of these sets must contain a pair of antipodal points fx; −xg . Proof: Let di : S 2!R measure distance to Ai , that is, di—x– … infy2Ai jx − yj . This is a continuous function, so we may apply the Borsuk–Ulam theorem to the map S 2!R 2 , x , ( d1—x–; d2—x– \u0001 , obtaining a pair of antipodal points x and −x with d1—x– … d1—−x– and d2—x– … d2—−x– . If either of these two distances is zero, then x and −x both lie in the same set A1 or A2 since these are closed sets. On the other hand, if the distances from x and −x to A1 and A2 are both strictly positive, then x and −x lie in neither A1 nor A2 so they must lie in A3 . tu To see that the number ‘three’ in this result is best possible, consider a sphere inscribed in a tetrahedron. Projecting the four faces of the tetrahedron radially onto the sphere, we obtain a cover of S 2 by four closed sets, none of which contains a pair of antipodal points. Assuming the higher-dimensional version of the Borsuk–Ulam theorem, the same arguments show that S n cannot be covered by n ‡ 1 closed sets without antipodal pairs of points, though it can be covered by n‡2 such sets, as the higher-dimensional analog of a tetrahedron shows. Even the case n … 1 is somewhat interesting: If the circle is covered by two closed sets, one of them must contain a pair of antipodal points. This is of course false for nonclosed sets since the circle is the union of two disjoint half-open semicircles. 34 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group The relation between the fundamental group of a product space and the funda- mental groups of its factors is as simple as one could wish: Proposition 1.12. ˇ1—X \u0002 Y– is isomorphic to ˇ1—X–\u0002 ˇ1—Y – if X and Y are path- connected. Proof: A basic property of the product topology is that a map f : Z!X \u0002 Y is con- tinuous iff the maps g : Z!X and h : Z!Y deﬁned by f—z– … —g—z–; h—z–– are both continuous. Hence a loop f in X \u0002 Y based at —x0;y0– is equivalent to a pair of loops g in X and h in Y based at x0 and y0 respectively. Similarly, a homotopy ft of a loop in X \u0002 Y is equivalent to a pair of homotopies gt and ht of the corresponding loops in X and Y . Thus we obtain a bijection ˇ1( X \u0002 Y; —x0;y0–\u0001 ˇ ˇ1—X; x0–\u0002 ˇ1—Y ; y0– , ƒf ⁄ , —ƒg⁄; ƒh⁄– . This is obviously a group homomorphism, and hence an isomor- phism. tu Example 1.13: The Torus. By the proposition we have an isomorphism ˇ1—S 1 \u0002 S 1– ˇ Z\u0002 Z . Under this isomorphism a pair —p; q– 2 Z\u0002 Z corresponds to a loop that winds p times around one S 1 factor of the torus and q times around the other S 1 factor, for example the loop !pq—s– … —!p—s–; !q—s–– . Interestingly, this loop can be knotted, as the ﬁgure shows for the case p … 3, q … 2 . The knots that arise in this fashion, the so-called torus knots, are studied in Example 1.24. More generally, the n dimensional torus, which is the product of n circles, has fundamental group isomorphic to the product of n copies of Z . This follows by induction on n . Induced Homomorphisms Suppose ' : X!Y is a map taking the basepoint x0 2 X to the basepoint y0 2 Y . For brevity we write ' : —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– in this situation. Then ' induces a homo- morphism '\u0003 : ˇ1—X; x0–!ˇ1—Y ; y0– , deﬁned by composing loops f : I!X based at x0 with ' , that is, '\u0003ƒf ⁄ … ƒ'f ⁄ . This induced map '\u0003 is well-deﬁned since a homotopy ft of loops based at x0 yields a composed homotopy 'ft of loops based at y0 ,so '\u0003ƒf0⁄ … ƒ'f0⁄ … ƒ'f1⁄ … '\u0003ƒf1⁄ . Furthermore, '\u0003 is a homomorphism since '—f g– … —'f – —'g– , both functions having the value 'f —2s– for 0 \u0014 s \u0014 1=2 and the value 'g—2s − 1– for 1=2 \u0014 s \u0014 1. Two basic properties of induced homomorphisms are: —' –\u0003 … '\u0003 \u0003 for a composition —X; x0– -----! —Y ; y0– ' -----! —Z; z0– . 11\u0003 … 11 , which is a concise way of saying that the identity map 11: X!X induces the identity map 11: ˇ1—X; x0–!ˇ1—X; x0– . The ﬁrst of these follows from the fact that composition of maps is associative, so —' –f … '— f – , and the second is obvious. These two properties of induced homo- morphisms are what makes the fundamental group a functor. The formal deﬁnition Basic Constructions Section 1.1 35 of a functor requires the introduction of certain other preliminary concepts, however, so we postpone this until it is needed in x2.3. If ' is a homeomorphism with inverse then '\u0003 is an isomorphism with inverse \u0003 since '\u0003 \u0003 … —' –\u0003 … 11\u0003 … 11 and similarly \u0003'\u0003 … 11 . We will use this fact in the following calculation of the fundamental groups of higher-dimensional spheres: Proposition 1.14. ˇ1—S n– … 0 if n \u0015 2 . Proof: Let f be a loop in S n at a chosen basepoint x0 . If the image of f is disjoint from some other point x 2 S n then f is nullhomotopic since S n −fxg is homeo- morphic to Rn , which is simply-connected. So it will sufﬁce to homotope f to be nonsurjective. To do this we will look at a small open ball B in S n about any point x ﬂ x0 and see that the number of times that f enters B , passes through x , and leaves B is ﬁnite, and each of these portions of f can be pushed off x without changing the rest of f . At ﬁrst glance this might appear to be a difﬁcult task to achieve since the parts of f in B could be quite complicated geometrically, for example space-ﬁlling curves. But in fact it turns out to be rather easy. The set f −1—B– is open in —0; 1– , hence is the union of a possibly inﬁnite collection of disjoint open intervals —ai;bi– . The compact set f −1—x– is contained in the union of these intervals, so it must be contained in the union of ﬁnitely many of them. Consider one of the intervals —ai;bi– meeting f −1—x– . The path fi obtained by restricting f to the closed interval ƒai;bi⁄ lies in the closure of B , and its endpoints f—ai– and f—bi– lie in the boundary of B .If n \u0015 2 , we can choose a path gi from f—ai– to f—bi– in the closure of B but disjoint from x . For example, we could choose gi to lie in the boundary of B , which is a sphere of dimension n − 1 , hence path-connected if n \u0015 2. Since the closure of B is homeomorphic to a convex set in R n and hence simply- connected, the path fi is homotopic to gi by Proposition 1.6, so we may homotope f by deforming fi to gi . After repeating this process for each of the intervals —ai;bi– that meet f −1—x– , we obtain a loop g homotopic to the original f and with g—I– disjoint from x . tu Example 1.15. For a point x in R n , the complement R n −fxg is homeomorphic to S n−1 \u0002 R , so by Proposition 1.12 ˇ1—R n −fxg– is isomorphic to ˇ1—S n−1–\u0002 ˇ1—R– . Hence ˇ1—R n −fxg– is Z for n … 2 and trivial for n> 2. Here is an application of this calculation: Corollary 1.16. R 2 is not homeomorphic to R n for n ﬂ 2 . Proof: Suppose f : R 2!R n is a homeomorphism. The case n … 1 is easily disposed of since R2 −f0g is path-connected but the homeomorphic space R n −ff—0–g is not path-connected when n … 1 . When n> 2 we cannot distinguish R2 −f0g from 36 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group R n −ff—0–g by the number of path-components, but by the preceding calculation of ˇ1—R n −fxg– we can distinguish them by their fundamental groups. tu The more general statement that R m is not homeomorphic to R n if m ﬂ n can be proved in the same way using either the higher homotopy groups or homology groups. In fact, nonempty open sets in R m and Rn can be homeomorphic only if m … n , as we will show in Theorem 2.19 using homology. Induced homomorphisms allow relations between spaces to be transformed into relations between their fundamental groups. Here is an illustration of this principle: Proposition 1.17. If a space X retracts onto a subspace A , then the homomorphism i\u0003 : ˇ1—A; x0–!ˇ1—X; x0– induced by the inclusion i : A > X is injective. If A is a deformation retract of X , then i\u0003 is an isomorphism. Proof:If r : X!A is a retraction, then ri … 11 , hence r\u0003i\u0003 … 11 , which implies that i\u0003 is injective. If rt : X!X is a deformation retraction of X onto A ,so r0 … 11, rtjA … 11, and r1—X– ˆ A , then for any loop f : I!X based at x0 2 A the composition rtf gives a homotopy of f to a loop in A ,so i\u0003 is also surjective. tu This gives another way of seeing that S 1 is not a retract of D2 , a fact we showed earlier in the proof of the Brouwer ﬁxed point theorem, since the inclusion-induced map ˇ1—S 1–!ˇ1—D2– is a homomorphism Z!0 that cannot be injective. The exact group-theoretic analog of a retraction is a homomorphism ˆ of a group G onto a subgroup H such that ˆ restricts to the identity on H . In the notation above, if we identify ˇ1—A– with its image under i\u0003 , then r\u0003 is such a homomorphism from ˇ1—X– onto the subgroup ˇ1—A– . The existence of a retracting homomorphism ˆ : G!H is quite a strong condition on H .If H is a normal subgroup, it implies that G is the direct product of H and the kernel of ˆ .If H is not normal, then G is what is called in group theory the semi-direct product of H and the kernel of ˆ . Recall from Chapter 0 the general deﬁnition of a homotopy as a family 't : X!Y , t 2 I , such that the associated map Ø : X \u0002 I!Y; Ø—x; t– … 't—x– , is continuous. If 't takes a subspace A ˆ X to a subspace B ˆ Y for all t , then we speak of a homotopy of maps of pairs, 't : —X; A–!—Y ; B– . In particular, a basepoint-preserving homotopy 't : —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– is the case that 't—x0– … y0 for all t . Another basic property of induced homomorphisms is their invariance under such homotopies: If 't : —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– is a basepoint-preserving homotopy, then '0\u0003 … '1\u0003 . This holds since '0\u0003ƒf ⁄ … ƒ'0f⁄ … ƒ'1f⁄ … '1\u0003ƒf ⁄ , the middle equality coming from the homotopy 'tf . There is a notion of homotopy equivalence for spaces with basepoints. One says —X; x0– ' —Y ; y0– if there are maps ' : —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– and : —Y ; y0–!—X; x0– Basic Constructions Section 1.1 37 with homotopies ' ' 11 and ' ' 11 through maps ﬁxing the basepoints. In this case the induced maps on ˇ1 satisfy '\u0003 \u0003 … —' –\u0003 … 11\u0003 … 11 and likewise \u0003'\u0003 … 11, so '\u0003 and \u0003 are inverse isomorphisms ˇ1—X; x0– ˇ ˇ1—Y ; y0– . This somewhat formal argument gives another proof that a deformation retraction induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups, since if X deformation retracts onto A then —X; x0– ' —A; x0– for any choice of basepoint x0 2 A . Having to pay so much attention to basepoints when dealing with the fundamental group is something of a nuisance. For homotopy equivalences one does not have to be quite so careful, as the conditions on basepoints can actually be dropped: Proposition 1.18. If ' : X!Y is a homotopy equivalence, then the induced homo- morphism '\u0003 : ˇ1—X; x0–!ˇ1( Y; '—x0–\u0001 is an isomorphism for all x0 2 X . The proof will use a simple fact about homotopies that do not ﬁx the basepoint: Lemma 1.19. If 't : X!Y is a homotopy and h is the path 't—x0– formed by the images of a basepoint x0 2 X , then the three maps in the diagram at the right satisfy '0\u0003 … \fh'1\u0003 . X,¼1 0()x Y,¼1 01( ( ))x' 1' Y,¼1 00( ( ))x'0' ¯h ¤ ¤¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! Proof: Let ht be the restriction of h to the interval ƒ0;t⁄ , with a reparametrization so that the domain of ht is still ƒ0; 1⁄ . Explicitly, we can take ht—s– … h—ts– . Then if f is a loop in X at the basepoint x0 , the product ht —'tf– ht gives a homotopy of loops at '0—x0– . Restricting this x00' f0' ft' f1' () x01 ht t ' () x0' () homotopy to t … 0 and t … 1 , we see that '0\u0003—ƒf ⁄– … \fh( '1\u0003—ƒf ⁄–\u0001 . tu Proof of 1.18: Let : Y!X be a homotopy-inverse for ' , so that ' ' 11 and ' ' 11 . Consider the maps ˇ1—X; x0– '\u0003------------! ˇ1( Y; '—x0–\u0001 \u0003------------! ˇ1( X; '—x0–\u0001 '\u0003------------! ˇ1( Y ; ' '—x0–\u0001 The composition of the ﬁrst two maps is an isomorphism since ' ' 11 implies that \u0003'\u0003 … \fh for some h , by the lemma. In particular, since \u0003'\u0003 is an isomorphism, '\u0003 is injective. The same reasoning with the second and third maps shows that \u0003 is injective. Thus the ﬁrst two of the three maps are injections and their composition is an isomorphism, so the ﬁrst map '\u0003 must be surjective as well as injective. tu 38 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group Exercises 1. Show that composition of paths satisﬁes the following cancellation property: If f0 g0 ' f1 g1 and g0 ' g1 then f0 ' f1 . 2. Show that the change-of-basepoint homomorphism \fh depends only on the homo- topy class of h . 3. For a path-connected space X , show that ˇ1—X– is abelian iff all basepoint-change homomorphisms \fh depend only on the endpoints of the path h . 4. A subspace X ˆ R n is said to be star-shaped if there is a point x0 2 X such that, for each x 2 X , the line segment from x0 to x lies in X . Show that if a subspace X ˆ Rn is locally star-shaped, in the sense that every point of X has a star-shaped neighborhood in X , then every path in X is homotopic in X to a piecewise linear path, that is, a path consisting of a ﬁnite number of straight line segments traversed at constant speed. Show this applies in particular when X is open or when X is a union of ﬁnitely many closed convex sets. 5. Show that for a space X , the following three conditions are equivalent: (a) Every map S 1!X is homotopic to a constant map, with image a point. (b) Every map S 1!X extends to a map D2!X . (c) ˇ1—X; x0– … 0 for all x0 2 X . Deduce that a space X is simply-connected iff all maps S 1!X are homotopic. [In this problem, ‘homotopic’ means ‘homotopic without regard to basepoints.’] 6. We can regard ˇ1—X; x0– as the set of basepoint-preserving homotopy classes of maps —S 1;s0–!—X; x0– . Let ƒS 1;X⁄ be the set of homotopy classes of maps S 1!X , with no conditions on basepoints. Thus there is a natural map Ø : ˇ1—X; x0–!ƒS 1;X⁄ obtained by ignoring basepoints. Show that Ø is onto if X is path-connected, and that Ø—ƒf ⁄– … Ø—ƒg⁄– iff ƒf ⁄ and ƒg⁄ are conjugate in ˇ1—X; x0– . Hence Ø induces a one- to-one correspondence between ƒS 1;X⁄ and the set of conjugacy classes in ˇ1—X– , when X is path-connected. 7. Deﬁne f : S 1 \u0002 I!S 1 \u0002 I by f—\u0012; s– … —\u0012 ‡ 2ˇs; s– ,so f restricts to the identity on the two boundary circles of S 1 \u0002 I . Show that f is homotopic to the identity by a homotopy ft that is stationary on one of the boundary circles, but not by any ho- motopy ft that is stationary on both boundary circles.

From the isomorphism ˇ1( X \u0002 Y; —x0;y0–\u0001 ˇ ˇ1—X; x0–\u0002 ˇ1—Y ; y0– it follows that loops in X \u0002fy0g and fx0g\u0002 Y represent commuting elements of ˇ1( X \u0002 Y; —x0;y0–\u0001 .

Show that there are no retractions r : X!A in the following cases: (a) X … R3 with A any subspace homeomorphic to S 1 . (b) X … S 1 \u0002 D2 with A its boundary torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 . (c) X … S 1 \u0002 D2 and A the circle shown in the ﬁgure. A(d) X … D2 _ D2 with A its boundary S 1 _ S 1 . (e) X a disk with two points on its boundary identiﬁed and A its boundary S 1 _ S 1 . (f) X the M¨obius band and A its boundary circle. 17. Construct inﬁnitely many nonhomotopic retractions S 1 _ S 1!S 1 . 18. Using the technique in the proof of Proposition 1.14, show that if a space X is obtained from a path-connected subspace A by attaching a cell en with n \u0015 2 , then the inclusion A > X induces a surjection on ˇ1 . Apply this to show: (a) The wedge sum S 1 _ S 2 has fundamental group Z . (b) For a path-connected CW complex X the inclusion map X1 > X of its 1 skeleton induces a surjection ˇ1—X1–!ˇ1—X– . [For the case that X has inﬁnitely many cells, see Proposition A.1 in the Appendix.] 19. Modify the proof of Proposition 1.14 to show that if X is a path-connected 1 dimensional CW complex with basepoint x0 a0 cell, then every loop in X is ho- motopic to a loop consisting of a ﬁnite sequence of edges traversed monotonically. [This gives an elementary proof that ˇ1—S 1– is cyclic, generated by the standard loop winding once around the circle. The more difﬁcult part of the calculation of ˇ1—S 1– is therefore the fact that no iterate of this loop is nullhomotopic.] 40 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group 20. Suppose ft : X!X is a homotopy such that f0 and f1 are each the identity map. Use Lemma 1.19 to show that for any x0 2 X , the loop ft—x0– represents an element of the center of ˇ1—X; x0– . [One can interpret the result as saying that a loop represents an element of the center of ˇ1—X– if it extends to a loop of maps X!X .] The van Kampen theorem gives a method for computing the fundamental groups of spaces that can be decomposed into simpler spaces whose fundamental groups are already known. By systematic use of this theorem one can compute the fundamental groups of a very large number of spaces. We shall see for example that for every group G there is a space XG whose fundamental group is isomorphic to G . To give some idea of how one might hope to compute fundamental groups by decomposing spaces into simpler pieces, let us look at an example. Consider the space X formed by two circles A and B intersecting in a single point, which we choose as the basepoint x0 . By our preceding calculations we know that ˇ1—A– is inﬁnite cyclic, generated by a loop a that goes once around A . Similarly, ˇ1—B– is a copy of Z generated by a loop b going b a once around B . Each product of powers of a and b then gives an element of ˇ1—X– . For example, the product a 5b2a −3ba 2 is the loop that goes ﬁve times around A , then twice around B , then three times around A in the opposite direction, then once around B , then twice around A . The set of all words like this consisting of powers of a alternating with powers of b forms a group usually denoted Z \u0003 Z . Multiplication in this group is deﬁned just as one would expect, for example —b4a 5b2a −3–—a 4b−1ab3– … b4a 5b2ab−1ab3 . The identity element is the empty word, and inverses are what they have to be, for example —ab2a −3b−4–−1 … b4a 3b−2a −1 . It would be very nice if such words in a and b corresponded exactly to elements of ˇ1—X– , so that ˇ1—X– was isomorphic to the group Z \u0003 Z . The van Kampen theorem will imply that this is indeed the case. Similarly, if X is the union of three circles touching at a single point, the van Kampen theorem will imply that ˇ1—X– is Z \u0003 Z \u0003 Z , the group consisting of words in powers of three letters a , b , c . The generalization to a union of any number of circles touching at one point will also follow. The group Z \u0003 Z is an example of a general construction called the free product of groups. The statement of van Kampen’s theorem will be in terms of free products, so before stating the theorem we will make an algebraic digression to describe the construction of free products in some detail. Van Kampen’s Theorem Section 1.2 41 Free Products of Groups Suppose one is given a collection of groups G\u000b and one wishes to construct a single group containing all these groups as subgroups. One way to do this would be to take the product group Q \u000b G\u000b , whose elements can be regarded as the functions \u000b , g\u000b 2 G\u000b . Or one could restrict to functions taking on nonidentity values at most ﬁnitely often, forming the direct sum L \u000b G\u000b . Both these constructions produce groups containing all the G\u000b ’s as subgroups, but with the property that elements of different subgroups G\u000b commute with each other. In the realm of nonabelian groups this commutativity is unnatural, and so one would like a ‘nonabelian’ version of Q \u000b G\u000b or L \u000b G\u000b . Since the sum L \u000b G\u000b is smaller and presumably simpler than Q \u000b G\u000b ,it should be easier to construct a nonabelian version of L \u000b G\u000b , and this is what the free product \u0003\u000b G\u000b achieves. Here is the precise deﬁnition. As a set, the free product \u0003\u000b G\u000b consists of all words g1g2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm of arbitrary ﬁnite length m \u0015 0 , where each letter gi belongs to a group G\u000bi and is not the identity element of G\u000bi , and adjacent letters gi and gi‡1 belong to different groups G\u000b , that is, \u000bi ﬂ \u000bi‡1 . Words satisfying these conditions are called reduced, the idea being that unreduced words can always be simpliﬁed to reduced words by writing adjacent letters that lie in the same G\u000bi as a single letter and by canceling trivial letters. The empty word is allowed, and will be the identity element of \u0003\u000b G\u000b . The group operation in \u0003\u000b G\u000b is juxtaposition, —g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm–—h1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 hn– … g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gmh1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 hn . This product may not be reduced, however: If gm and h1 belong to the same G\u000b , they should be combined into a single letter —gmh1– according to the multiplication in G\u000b , and if this new letter gmh1 happens to be the identity of G\u000b ,it should be canceled from the product. This may allow gm−1 and h2 to be combined, and possibly canceled too. Repetition of this process eventually produces a reduced word. For example, in the product —g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm–—g−1 m \u0001\u0001\u0001 g−1 1 – everything cancels and we get the identity element of \u0003\u000b G\u000b , the empty word. Verifying directly that this multiplication is associative would be rather tedious, but there is an indirect approach that avoids most of the work. Let W be the set of reduced words g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm as above, including the empty word. To each g 2 G\u000b we associate the function Lg : W!W given by multiplication on the left, Lg—g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm– … gg1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm where we combine g with g1 if g1 2 G\u000b to make gg1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm a reduced word. A key property of the association g , Lg is the formula Lgg0 … LgLg0 for g; g0 2 G\u000b , that is, g—g0—g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm–– … —gg0–—g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm– . This special case of asso- ciativity follows rather trivially from associativity in G\u000b . The formula Lgg0 … LgLg0 implies that Lg is invertible with inverse Lg−1 . Therefore the association g , Lg de- ﬁnes a homomorphism from G\u000b to the group P—W – of all permutations of W . More generally, we can deﬁne L : W!P—W – by L—g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm– … Lg1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 Lgm for each reduced word g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm . This function L is injective since the permutation L—g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm– sends the empty word to g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm . The product operation in W corresponds under L to 42 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group composition in P—W – , because of the relation Lgg0 … LgLg0 . Since composition in P—W – is associative, we conclude that the product in W is associative. In particular, we have the free product Z \u0003 Z as described earlier. This is an example of a free group, the free product of any number of copies of Z , ﬁnite or inﬁnite. The elements of a free group are uniquely representable as reduced words in powers of generators for the various copies of Z , with one generator for each Z , just as in the case of Z \u0003 Z . These generators are called a basis for the free group, and the number of basis elements is the rank of the free group. The abelianization of a free group is a free abelian group with basis the same set of generators, so since the rank of a free abelian group is well-deﬁned, independent of the choice of basis, the same is true for the rank of a free group. An interesting example of a free product that is not a free group is Z2 \u0003 Z2 . This is like Z \u0003 Z but simpler since a2 … e … b2 , so powers of a and b are not needed, and Z2 \u0003 Z2 consists of just the alternating words in a and b : a , b , ab , ba , aba , bab , abab , baba , ababa; \u0001\u0001\u0001 , together with the empty word. The structure of Z2 \u0003 Z2 can be elucidated by looking at the homomorphism ' : Z2 \u0003 Z2!Z2 associating to each word its length mod 2 . Obviously ' is surjective, and its kernel consists of the words of even length. These form an inﬁnite cyclic subgroup generated by ab since ba … —ab–−1 in Z2 \u0003 Z2 . In fact, Z2 \u0003 Z2 is the semi-direct product of the subgroups Z and Z2 generated by ab and a , with the conjugation relation a—ab–a −1 … —ab– −1 . This group is sometimes called the inﬁnite dihedral group. For a general free product \u0003\u000b G\u000b , each group G\u000b is naturally identiﬁed with a subgroup of \u0003\u000b G\u000b , the subgroup consisting of the empty word and the nonidentity one-letter words g 2 G\u000b . From this viewpoint the empty word is the common iden- tity element of all the subgroups G\u000b , which are otherwise disjoint. A consequence of associativity is that any product g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm of elements gi in the groups G\u000b has a unique reduced form, the element of \u0003\u000b G\u000b obtained by performing the multiplica- tions in any order. Any sequence of reduction operations on an unreduced product g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm , combining adjacent letters gi and gi‡1 that lie in the same G\u000b or canceling a gi that is the identity, can be viewed as a way of inserting parentheses into g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gm and performing the resulting sequence of multiplications. Thus associativity implies that any two sequences of reduction operations performed on the same unreduced word always yield the same reduced word. A basic property of the free product \u0003\u000b G\u000b is that any collection of homomor- phisms '\u000b : G\u000b!H extends uniquely to a homomorphism ' : \u0003\u000b G\u000b!H . Namely, the value of ' on a word g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gn with gi 2 G\u000bi must be '\u000b1 —g1– \u0001\u0001\u0001 '\u000bn —gn– , and using this formula to deﬁne ' gives a well-deﬁned homomorphism since the process of reducing an unreduced product in \u0003\u000b G\u000b does not affect its image under ' . For example, for a free product G \u0003 H the inclusions G > G\u0002 H and H > G\u0002 H induce a surjective homomorphism G \u0003 H!G\u0002 H . Van Kampen’s Theorem Section 1.2 43 The van Kampen Theorem Suppose a space X is decomposed as the union of a collection of path-connected open subsets A\u000b , each of which contains the basepoint x0 2 X . By the remarks in the preceding paragraph, the homomorphisms j\u000b : ˇ1—A\u000b–!ˇ1—X– induced by the inclu- sions A\u000b > X extend to a homomorphism Ø : \u0003\u000b ˇ1—A\u000b–!ˇ1—X– . The van Kampen theorem will say that Ø is very often surjective, but we can expect Ø to have a nontriv- ial kernel in general. For if i\u000b\f : ˇ1—A\u000b \\ A\f–!ˇ1—A\u000b– is the homomorphism induced by the inclusion A\u000b \\ A\f > A\u000b then j\u000bi\u000b\f … j\fi\f\u000b , both these compositions being induced by the inclusion A\u000b \\ A\f > X , so the kernel of Ø contains all the elements of the form i\u000b\f—!–i\f\u000b—!– −1 for ! 2 ˇ1—A\u000b \\ A\f– . Van Kampen’s theorem asserts that under fairly broad hypotheses this gives a full description of Ø : Theorem 1.20. If X is the union of path-connected open sets A\u000b each containing the basepoint x0 2 X and if each intersection A\u000b \\ A\f is path-connected, then the homomorphism Ø : \u0003\u000b ˇ1—A\u000b–!ˇ1—X– is surjective. If in addition each intersection A\u000b \\A\f \\Aγ is path-connected, then the kernel of Ø is the normal subgroup N gener- ated by all elements of the form i\u000b\f—!–i\f\u000b—!– −1 , and so Ø induces an isomorphism ˇ1—X– ˇ\u0003\u000b ˇ1—A\u000b–=N . Example 1.21: Wedge Sums. In Chapter 0 we deﬁned the wedge sum W \u000b X\u000b of a collection of spaces X\u000b with basepoints x\u000b 2 X\u000b to be the quotient space of the disjoint union ` \u000b X\u000b in which all the basepoints x\u000b are identiﬁed to a single point. If each x\u000b is a deformation retract of an open neighborhood U\u000b in X\u000b , then X\u000b is a deformation retract of its open neighborhood A\u000b … X\u000bW \fﬂ\u000b U\f . The intersection of two or more distinct A\u000b ’s is W \u000b U\u000b , which deformation retracts to a point. Van Kampen’s theorem then implies that Ø : \u0003\u000b ˇ1—X\u000b–!ˇ1—W \u000b X\u000b– is an isomorphism. Thus for a wedge sum W \u000b S 1 \u000b of circles, ˇ1—W \u000b S 1 \u000b– is a free group, the free product of copies of Z , one for each circle S 1 \u000b . In particular, ˇ1—S 1 _S 1– is the free group Z\u0003Z , as in the example at the beginning of this section. It is true more generally that the fundamental group of any connected graph is free, as we show in x1.A. Here is an example illustrating the general technique. Example 1.22. Let X be the graph shown in the ﬁgure, consist- ing of the twelve edges of a cube. The seven heavily shaded edges form a maximal tree T ˆ X , a contractible subgraph containing all the vertices of X . We claim that ˇ1—X– is the free product of ﬁve copies of Z , one for each edge not in T . To deduce this from van Kampen’s theorem, choose for each edge e\u000b of X − T an open neighborhood A\u000b of T [ e\u000b in X that deformation retracts onto T [ e\u000b . The intersection of two or more A\u000b ’s deformation retracts onto T , hence is contractible. The A\u000b ’s form a cover of X satisfying the hypotheses of van Kampen’s theorem, and since the intersection of 44 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group any two of them is simply-connected we obtain an isomorphism ˇ1—X– ˇ\u0003\u000b ˇ1—A\u000b– . Each A\u000b deformation retracts onto a circle, so ˇ1—X– is free on ﬁve generators, as claimed. As explicit generators we can choose for each edge e\u000b of X − T a loop f\u000b that starts at a basepoint in T , travels in T to one end of e\u000b , then across e\u000b , then back to the basepoint along a path in T . Van Kampen’s theorem is often applied when there are just two sets A\u000b and A\f in the cover of X , so the condition on triple intersections A\u000b\\A\f\\Aγ is superﬂuous and one obtains an isomorphism ˇ1—X– ˇ ( ˇ1—A\u000b– \u0003 ˇ1—A\f–\u0001 =N , under the assumption that A\u000b \\ A\f is path-connected. The proof in this special case is virtually identical with the proof in the general case, however. One can see that the intersections A\u000b \\ A\f need to be path-connected by con- sidering the example of S 1 decomposed as the union of two open arcs. In this case Ø is not surjective. For an example showing that triple intersections A\u000b \\ A\f \\ Aγ need to be path-connected, let X be the suspension of three points a , b , c , and let A\u000b;A\f , and Aγ be the complements of these three points. The theo- ab c rem does apply to the covering fA\u000b;A\fg , so there are isomorphisms ˇ1—X– ˇ ˇ1—A\u000b– \u0003 ˇ1—A\f– ˇ Z \u0003 Z since A\u000b \\ A\f is contractible. If we tried to use the covering fA\u000b;A\f;Aγg , which has each of the twofold intersections path-connected but not the triple intersection, then we would get ˇ1—X– ˇ Z \u0003 Z \u0003 Z , but this is not isomorphic to Z \u0003 Z since it has a different abelianization. Proof of van Kampen’s theorem: First we consider surjectivity of Ø . Given a loop f : I!X at the basepoint x0 , we claim there is a partition 0 … s0 <s1 < \u0001\u0001\u0001 <sm … 1 of I such that each subinterval ƒsi−1;si⁄ is mapped by f to a single A\u000b . Namely, since f is continuous, each s 2 I has an open neighborhood Vs in I mapped by f to some A\u000b . We may in fact take Vs to be an interval whose closure is mapped to a single A\u000b . Compactness of I implies that a ﬁnite number of these intervals cover I . The endpoints of this ﬁnite set of intervals then deﬁne the desired partition of I . Denote the A\u000b containing f —ƒsi−1;si⁄– by Ai , and let fi be the path obtained by restricting f to ƒsi−1;si⁄ . Then f is the composition f1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 fm with fi a path in Ai . Since we assume Ai \\ Ai‡1 is path-connected, we may choose a path gi in Ai \\ Ai‡1 from x0 to the point f—si– 2 Ai \\ Ai‡1 . Consider the loop g 1 g 2 2f 1f 3f A® A¯ x0—f1 g1– —g1 f2 g2– —g2 f3 g3– \u0001\u0001\u0001 —gm−1 fm– which is homotopic to f . This loop is a composition of loops each lying in a single Ai , the loops indicated by the parentheses. Hence ƒf ⁄ is in the image of Ø , and Ø is surjective. The harder part of the proof is to show that the kernel of Ø is N . It may clarify Van Kampen’s Theorem Section 1.2 45 matters to introduce some terminology. By a factorization of an element ƒf ⁄ 2 ˇ1—X– we shall mean a formal product ƒf1⁄ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ƒfk⁄ where: Each fi is a loop in some A\u000b at the basepoint x0 , and ƒfi⁄ 2 ˇ1—A\u000b– is the homotopy class of fi . The loop f is homotopic to f1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 fk in X . A factorization of ƒf ⁄ is thus a word in \u0003\u000b ˇ1—A\u000b– , possibly unreduced, that is mapped to ƒf ⁄ by Ø . The proof of surjectivity of Ø showed that every ƒf ⁄ 2 ˇ1—X– has a factorization. We will be concerned now with the uniqueness of factorizations. Call two factor- izations of ƒf ⁄ equivalent if they are related by a sequence of the following two sorts of moves or their inverses: Combine adjacent terms ƒfi⁄ƒfi‡1⁄ into a single term ƒfi fi‡1⁄ if ƒfi⁄ and ƒfi‡1⁄ lie in the same group ˇ1—A\u000b– . Regard the term ƒfi⁄ 2 ˇ1—A\u000b– as lying in the group ˇ1—A\f– rather than ˇ1—A\u000b– if fi is a loop in A\u000b \\ A\f . The ﬁrst move does not change the element of \u0003\u000b ˇ1—A\u000b– deﬁned by the factorization. The second move does not change the image of this element in the quotient group Q …\u0003\u000b ˇ1—A\u000b–=N , by the deﬁnition of N . So equivalent factorizations give the same element of Q . If we can show that any two factorizations of ƒf ⁄ are equivalent, this will say that the map Q!ˇ1—X– induced by Ø is injective, hence the kernel of Ø is exactly N , and the proof will be complete. Let ƒf1⁄ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ƒfk⁄ and ƒf 0 1⁄ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ƒf 0 `⁄ be two factorizations of ƒf ⁄ . The composed paths f1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 fk and f 0 1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 f 0 ` are then homotopic, so let F : I \u0002 I!X be a homo- topy from f1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 fk to f 0 1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 f 0 ` . There exist partitions 0 … s0 <s1 < \u0001\u0001\u0001 <sm … 1 and 0 … t0 <t1 < \u0001\u0001\u0001 <tn … 1 such that each rectangle Rij … ƒsi−1;si⁄\u0002 ƒtj−1;tj⁄ is mapped by F into a single A\u000b , which we label Aij . These partitions may be ob- tained by covering I \u0002 I by ﬁnitely many rectangles ƒa; b⁄\u0002 ƒc; d⁄ each mapping to a single A\u000b , using a compactness argument, then partitioning I \u0002 I by the union of all the horizontal and vertical lines containing edges of these rectangles. We may assume the s partition subdivides the partitions giving the products f1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 fk and f 0 1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 f 0 ` . Since F maps a neighborhood 1 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 10 11 12 of Rij to Aij , we may perturb the vertical sides of the rect- angles Rij so that each point of I \u0002 I lies in at most three Rij ’s. We may assume there are at least three rows of rect- angles, so we can do this perturbation just on the rectangles in the intermediate rows, leaving the top and bottom rows unchanged. Let us relabel the new rectangles R1;R2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;Rmn , ordering them as in the ﬁgure. 46 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group If γ is a path in I \u0002 I from the left edge to the right edge, then the restriction F jj γ is a loop at the basepoint x0 since F maps both the left and right edges of I \u0002 I to x0 . Let γr be the path separating the ﬁrst r rectangles R1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;Rr from the remaining rectangles. Thus γ0 is the bottom edge of I \u0002 I and γmn is the top edge. We pass from γr to γr ‡1 by pushing across the rectangle Rr ‡1 . Let us call the corners of the Rr ’s vertices. For each vertex v with F—v– ﬂ x0 , let gv be a path from x0 to F—v– . We can choose gv to lie in the intersection of the two or three Aij ’s corresponding to the Rr ’s containing v since we assume the intersection of any two or three Aij ’s is path-connected. If we insert into F jj γr the appropriate paths gv gv at successive vertices, as in the proof of surjectivity of Ø , then we obtain a factorization of ƒF jj γr ⁄ by regarding the loop corresponding to a horizontal or vertical segment between adjacent vertices as lying in the Aij for either of the Rs ’s containing the segment. Different choices of these containing Rs ’s change the factorization of ƒF jj γr ⁄ to an equivalent factorization. Furthermore, the factorizations associated to successive paths γr and γr ‡1 are equivalent since pushing γr across Rr ‡1 to γr ‡1 changes F jj γr to F jj γr ‡1 by a homotopy within the Aij corresponding to Rr ‡1 , and we can choose this Aij for all the segments of γr and γr ‡1 in Rr ‡1 . We can arrange that the factorization associated to γ0 is equivalent to the factor- ization ƒf1⁄ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ƒfk⁄ by choosing the path gv for each vertex v along the lower edge of I \u0002 I to lie not just in the two Aij ’s corresponding to the Rs ’s containing v , but also to lie in the A\u000b for the fi containing v in its domain. In case v is the common end- point of the domains of two consecutive fi ’s we have F—v– … x0 , so there is no need to choose a gv . In similar fashion we may assume that the factorization associated to the ﬁnal γmn is equivalent to ƒf 0 1⁄ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ƒf 0 `⁄ . Since the factorizations associated to all the γr ’s are equivalent, we conclude that the factorizations ƒf1⁄ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ƒfk⁄ and ƒf 0 1⁄ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ƒf 0 `⁄ are equivalent. tu Example 1.23: Linking of Circles. We can apply van Kampen’s theorem to calculate the fundamental groups of three spaces discussed in the introduction to this chapter, the complements in R 3 of a single circle, two unlinked circles, and two linked circles. The complement R 3 −A of a single circle A deformation retracts onto a wedge sum S 1 _ S 2 embedded in R 3 −A as shown in the ﬁrst of the two ﬁgures at the right. It may be easier to see A A that R 3−A deformation retracts onto the union of S 2 with a diameter, as in the second ﬁgure, where points outside S 2 deformation retract onto S 2 , and points inside S 2 and not in A can be pushed away from A toward S 2 or the diameter. Having this deformation retraction in mind, one can then see how it must be modiﬁed if the two endpoints of the diameter are gradually moved toward each other along the equator until they coincide, forming the S 1 summand of S 1 _S 2 . Another way of seeing the deformation Van Kampen’s Theorem Section 1.2 47 retraction of R 3 − A onto S 1 _ S 2 is to note ﬁrst that an open \" neighborhood of S 1 _ S 2 obviously deformation retracts onto S 1 _ S 2 if \" is sufﬁciently small. Then observe that this neighborhood is homeomorphic to R3 − A by a homeomorphism that is the identity on S 1 _ S 2 . In fact, the neighborhood can be gradually enlarged by homeomorphisms until it becomes all of R 3 − A . In any event, once we see that R3 − A deformation retracts to S 1 _ S 2 , then we immediately obtain isomorphisms ˇ1—R3 − A– ˇ ˇ1—S 1 _ S 2– ˇ Z since ˇ1—S 2– … 0. In similar fashion, the complement R3 − —A [ B– of two unlinked circles A and B deformation retracts onto S 1_S 1_S 2_S 2 , as in the ﬁgure to the right. From AB this we get ˇ1( R 3 − —A [ B–\u0001 ˇ Z \u0003 Z . On the other hand, if A and B are linked, then R 3 − —A [ B– deformation retracts onto the wedge sum of S 2 and a torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 separating A and B , as shown in the ﬁgure to the left, hence ˇ1( R 3 − —A [ B–\u0001 ˇ ˇ1—S 1 \u0002 S 1– ˇ Z\u0002 Z . Example 1.24: Torus Knots. For relatively prime positive integers m and n , the torus knot K … Km;n ˆ R 3 is the image of the embedding f : S 1!S 1 \u0002 S 1 ˆ R 3 , f—z– … —zm;zn– , where the torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 is embedded in R 3 in the standard way. The knot K winds around the torus a total of m times in the longitudinal direction and n times in the meridional direction, as shown in the ﬁgure for the cases —m; n– … —2; 3– and —3; 4– . One needs to assume that m and n are relatively prime in order for the map f to be injective. Without this assumption f would be d –to–1 where d is the greatest common divisor of m and n , and the image of f would be the knot Km=d;n=d . One could also allow negative values for m or n , but this would only change K to a mirror-image knot. Let us compute ˇ1—R3 − K– . It is slightly easier to do the calculation with R 3 re- placed by its one-point compactiﬁcation S 3 . An application of van Kampen’s theorem shows that this does not affect ˇ1 . Namely, write S 3 − K as the union of R 3 − K and an open ball B formed by the compactiﬁcation point together with the complement of a large closed ball in R3 containing K . Both B and B \\ —R3 − K– are simply-connected, the latter space being homeomorphic to S 2 \u0002 R . Hence van Kampen’s theorem implies that the inclusion R3 − K > S 3 − K induces an isomorphism on ˇ1 . We compute ˇ1—S 3 − K– by showing that it deformation retracts onto a 2 dimen- sional complex X … Xm;n homeomorphic to the quotient space of a cylinder S 1 \u0002 I under the identiﬁcations —z; 0– ˘ —e2ˇ i=mz; 0– and —z; 1– ˘ —e2ˇ i=nz; 1– . Ifwelet Xm and Xn be the two halves of X formed by the quotients of S 1 \u0002 ƒ0; 1=2⁄ and S 1 \u0002 ƒ1=2; 1⁄, then Xm and Xn are the mapping cylinders of z , zm and z , zn . The intersection 48 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group Xm \\ Xn is the circle S 1 \u0002f1=2g, the domain end of each mapping cylinder. To obtain an embedding of X in S 3 − K as a deformation retract we will use the standard decomposition of S 3 into two solid tori S 1 \u0002 D2 and D2 \u0002 S 1 , the result of regarding S 3 as @D4 … @—D2 \u0002 D2– … @D2 \u0002 D2 [ D2 \u0002 @D2 . Geometrically, the ﬁrst solid torus S 1 \u0002 D2 can be identiﬁed with the compact region in R 3 bounded by the standard torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 containing K , and the second solid torus D2 \u0002 S 1 is then the closure of the complement of the ﬁrst solid torus, together with the compactiﬁcation point at inﬁnity. Notice that meridional circles in S 1 \u0002 S 1 bound disks in the ﬁrst solid torus, while it is longitudinal circles that bound disks in the second solid torus. In the ﬁrst solid torus, K intersects each of the meridian circles fxg\u0002 @D2 in m equally spaced points, as indicated in the ﬁgure at the right, which shows a meridian disk fxg\u0002 D2 . K K K These m points can be separated by a union of m radial line segments. Letting x vary, these radial segments then trace out a copy of the mapping cylinder Xm in the ﬁrst solid torus. Sym- metrically, there is a copy of the other mapping cylinder Xn in the second solid torus. The complement of K in the ﬁrst solid torus deformation retracts onto Xm by ﬂowing within each meridian disk as shown. In similar fashion the complement of K in the second solid torus deformation retracts onto Xn . These two deformation retractions do not agree on their common domain of deﬁnition S 1 \u0002 S 1 − K , but this is easy to correct by distorting the ﬂows in the two solid tori so that in S 1 \u0002 S 1 − K both ﬂows are orthogonal to K . After this modiﬁcation we now have a well-deﬁned deformation retraction of S 3 − K onto X . Another way of describing the situation would be to say that for an open \" neighborhood N of K bounded by a torus T , the complement S 3 − N is the mapping cylinder of a map T!X . To compute ˇ1—X– we apply van Kampen’s theorem to the decomposition of X as the union of Xm and Xn , or more properly, open neighborhoods of these two sets that deformation retract onto them. Both Xm and Xn are mapping cylinders that deformation retract onto circles, and Xm \\ Xn is a circle, so all three of these spaces have fundamental group Z . A loop in Xm \\ Xn representing a generator of ˇ1—Xm \\ Xn– is homotopic in Xm to a loop representing m times a generator, and in Xn to a loop representing n times a generator. Van Kampen’s theorem then says that ˇ1—X– is the quotient of the free group on generators a and b obtained by factoring out the normal subgroup generated by the element a mb−n . Let us denote by Gm;n this group ˇ1—Xm;n– deﬁned by two generators a and b and one relation am … bn .If m or n is 1 , then Gm;n is inﬁnite cyclic since in these cases the relation just expresses one generator as a power of the other. To describe the structure of Gm;n when m; n > 1 let us ﬁrst compute the center of Gm;n , the subgroup consisting of elements that commute with all elements of Gm;n . The element am … bn commutes with a and b , so the cyclic subgroup C generated Van Kampen’s Theorem Section 1.2 49 by this element lies in the center. In particular, C is a normal subgroup, so we can pass to the quotient group Gm;n=C , which is the free product Zm \u0003 Zn . According to Exercise 1 at the end of this section, a free product of nontrivial groups has trivial center. From this it follows that C is exactly the center of Gm;n . As we will see in Example 1.44, the elements a and b have inﬁnite order in Gm;n ,so C is inﬁnite cyclic, but we will not need this fact here. We will show now that the integers m and n are uniquely determined by the group Zm \u0003 Zn , hence also by Gm;n . The abelianization of Zm \u0003 Zn is Zm \u0002 Zn ,of order mn , so the product mn is uniquely determined by Zm \u0003 Zn . To determine m and n individually, we use another assertion from Exercise 1 at the end of the section, that all torsion elements of Zm \u0003 Zn are conjugate to elements of the subgroups Zm and Zn , hence have order dividing m or n . Thus the maximum order of torsion elements of Zm \u0003 Zn is the larger of m and n . The larger of these two numbers is therefore uniquely determined by the group Zm \u0003 Zn , hence also the smaller since the product is uniquely determined. The preceding analysis of ˇ1—Xm;n– did not need the assumption that m and n are relatively prime, which was used only to relate Xm;n to torus knots. An interesting fact is that Xm;n can be embedded in R 3 only when m and n are relatively prime. This is shown in the remarks following Corollary 3.45. For example, X2;2 is the Klein bottle since it is the union of two copies of the M¨obius band X2 with their boundary circles identiﬁed, so this nonembeddability statement generalizes the fact that the Klein bottle cannot be embedded in R3 . An algorithm for computing a presentation for ˇ1—R 3−K– for an arbitrary smooth or piecewise linear knot K is described in the exercises, but the problem of determin- ing when two of these fundamental groups are isomorphic is generally much more difﬁcult than in the special case of torus knots. Example 1.25: The Shrinking Wedge of Circles. Consider the sub- space X ˆ R 2 that is the union of the circles Cn of radius 1=n and center —1=n; 0– for n … 1; 2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 . At ﬁrst glance one might confuse X with the wedge sum of an inﬁnite sequence of circles, but we will show that X has a much larger fundamental group than the wedge sum. Consider the retractions rn : X!Cn collapsing all Ci ’s except Cn to the origin. Each rn induces a surjection ˆn : ˇ1—X–!ˇ1—Cn– ˇ Z , where we take the origin as the basepoint. The product of the ˆn ’s is a homomorphism ˆ : ˇ1—X–! Q 1 Z to the direct product (not the direct sum) of inﬁnitely many copies of Z , and ˆ is surjective since for every sequence of integers kn we can construct a loop f : I!X that wraps kn times around Cn in the time interval ƒ1 − 1=n; 1 − 1=n‡1⁄. This inﬁnite composition of loops is certainly continuous at each time less than 1 , and it is continuous at time 1 since every neighborhood of the basepoint in X contains all but ﬁnitely many of the circles Cn . Since ˇ1—X– maps onto the uncountable group Q 1 Z , it is uncountable. 50 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group On the other hand, the fundamental group of a wedge sum of countably many circles is countably generated, hence countable. The group ˇ1—X– is actually far more complicated than Q 1 Z . For one thing, it is nonabelian, since the retraction X!C1 [\u0001\u0001\u0001 [ Cn that collapses all the circles smaller than Cn to the basepoint induces a surjection from ˇ1—X– to a free group on n generators. For a complete description of ˇ1—X– see [Cannon & Conner 2000]. It is a theorem of [Shelah 1988] that for a path-connected, locally path-connected compact metric space X , ˇ1—X– is either ﬁnitely generated or uncountable. Applications to Cell Complexes For the remainder of this section we shall be interested in 2 dimensional cell complexes, analyzing how the fundamental group is affected by attaching 2 cells. According to an exercise at the end of this section, attaching cells of higher dimension has no effect on ˇ1 , so all the interest lies in how the 2 cells are attached. Suppose we attach a collection of 2 cells e2 \u000b to a path-connected space X via maps '\u000b : S 1!X , producing a space Y .If s0 is a basepoint of S 1 then '\u000b determines a loop at '\u000b—s0– that we shall call '\u000b , even though technically loops are maps I!X rather than S 1!X . For different \u000b ’s the basepoints '\u000b—s0– of these loops '\u000b may not all coincide. To remedy this, choose a basepoint x0 2 X and a path γ\u000b in X from x0 to '\u000b—s0– for each \u000b . Then γ\u000b'\u000bγ\u000b is a loop at x0 . This loop may not be nullhomotopic in X , but it will certainly be nullhomotopic after the cell e2 \u000b is attached. Thus the normal subgroup N ˆ ˇ1—X; x0– generated by all the loops γ\u000b'\u000bγ\u000b for varying \u000b lies in the kernel of the map ˇ1—X; x0–!ˇ1—Y ; x0– induced by the inclusion X > Y . Proposition 1.26. The inclusion X > Y induces a surjection ˇ1—X; x0–!ˇ1—Y ; x0– whose kernel is N . Thus ˇ1—Y – ˇ ˇ1—X–=N . It follows that N is independent of the choice of the paths γ\u000b , but this can also be seen directly: If we replace γ\u000b by another path \u0011\u000b having the same endpoints, then γ\u000b'\u000bγ\u000b changes to \u0011\u000b'\u000b\u0011\u000b … —\u0011\u000bγ\u000b–γ\u000b'\u000bγ\u000b—γ\u000b\u0011\u000b– ,so γ\u000b'\u000bγ\u000b and \u0011\u000b'\u000b\u0011\u000b deﬁne conjugate elements of ˇ1—X; x0– . Proof: Let us expand Y to a slightly larger space Z that deformation retracts onto Y and is more convenient for applying van Kampen’s theorem. The space Z is obtained from Y by attaching rectangular strips S\u000b … I \u0002 I , with the lower edge I \u0002f0g attached along γ\u000b , the right edge f1g\u0002 I attached along an arc in e2 \u000b , and all the left edges f0g\u0002 I of the different strips identiﬁed together. The top edges of the strips are SX e x y 2 0 ® ® ® ®°not attached to anything, and this allows us to deformation retract Z onto Y . Van Kampen’s Theorem Section 1.2 51 In each cell e2 \u000b choose a point y\u000b not in the arc along which S\u000b is attached. Let A … Z − S\u000bfy\u000bg and let B … Z − X . Then A deformation retracts onto X , and B is contractible. Since ˇ1—B– … 0 , van Kampen’s theorem applied to the cover fA; Bg says that ˇ1—Z– is isomorphic to the quotient of ˇ1—A– by the normal subgroup generated by the image of the map ˇ1—A \\ B–!ˇ1—A– . So it remains only to see that ˇ1—A \\ B– is generated by the loops γ\u000b'\u000bγ\u000b , or rather by loops in A \\ B homotopic to these loops. This can be shown by another application of van Kampen’s theorem, this time to the cover of A \\ B by the open sets A\u000b … A \\ B − S \fﬂ\u000b e2 \f . Since A\u000b deformation retracts onto a circle in e2 \u000b −fy\u000bg , we have ˇ1—A\u000b– ˇ Z generated by a loop homotopic to γ\u000b'\u000bγ\u000b , and the result follows. tu As a ﬁrst application we compute the fundamental group of the orientable surface Mg of genus g . This has a cell structure with one 0 cell, 2g 1 cells, and one 2 cell, as we saw in Chapter 0. The 1 skeleton is a wedge sum of 2g circles, with fundamental group free on 2g generators. The 2 cell is attached along the loop given by the product of the commutators of these generators, say ƒa1;b1⁄ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ƒag;bg⁄ . Therefore ˇ1—Mg– ˇ a1;b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;ag;bg jjjj ƒa1;b1⁄ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ƒag;bg⁄ \u000b where g\u000b jjjj r\f \u000b denotes the group with generators g\u000b and relators r\f , in other words, the free group on the generators g\u000b modulo the normal subgroup generated by the words r\f in these generators. Corollary 1.27. The surface Mg is not homeomorphic, or even homotopy equivalent, to Mh if g ﬂ h . Proof: The abelianization of ˇ1—Mg– is the direct sum of 2g copies of Z .So if Mg ' Mh then ˇ1—Mg– ˇ ˇ1—Mh– , hence the abelianizations of these groups are iso- morphic, which implies g … h . tu Nonorientable surfaces can be treated in the same way. If we attach a 2 cell to the wedge sum of g circles by the word a2 1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 a 2 g we obtain a nonorientable surface Ng . For example, N1 is the projective plane RP2 , the quotient of D2 with antipodal points of @D2 identiﬁed. And N2 is the Klein bottle, though the more usual representation a a 1N 2N a b a b c a a cc b : ¡¡¡ : ¡¡¡¡ of the Klein bottle is as a square with opposite sides identiﬁed via the word aba −1b . If one cuts the square along a diagonal and reassembles the resulting two triangles as shown in the ﬁgure, one obtains the other representation as a square with sides 52 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group identiﬁed via the word a 2c2 . By the proposition, ˇ1—Ng– ˇ a1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;ag jjjj a2 1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 a 2 g \u000b . This abelianizes to the direct sum of Z2 with g − 1 copies of Z since in the abelian- ization we can rechoose the generators to be a1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;ag−1 and a1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ ag , with 2—a1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ ag– … 0 . Hence Ng is not homotopy equivalent to Nh if g ﬂ h , nor is Ng homotopy equivalent to any orientable surface Mh . Here is another application of the preceding proposition: Corollary 1.28. For every group G there is a 2 dimensional cell complex XG with ˇ1—XG– ˇ G . Proof: Choose a presentation G … g\u000b jjjj r\f \u000b . This exists since every group is a quotient of a free group, so the g\u000b ’s can be taken to be the generators of this free group with the r\f ’s generators of the kernel of the map from the free group to G . Now construct XG from W \u000b S 1 \u000b by attaching 2 cells e2 \f by the loops speciﬁed by the words r\f . tu Example 1.29.If G … a jjjj a n \u000b … Zn then XG is S 1 with a cell e2 attached by the map z , zn , thinking of S 1 as the unit circle in C . When n … 2 we get XG … RP2 , but for n> 2 the space XG is not a surface since there are n ‘sheets’ of e2 attached at each point of the circle S 1 ˆ XG . For example, when n … 3 one can construct a neighbor- hood N of S 1 in XG by taking the product of the graph with the interval I , and then identifying the two ends of this product via a one-third twist as shown in the ﬁgure. The boundary of N consists of a single circle, formed by the three endpoints of each cross section of N . To complete the construction of XG from N one attaches a disk along the boundary circle of N . This cannot be done in R3 , though it can in R4 . For n … 4 one would use the graph instead of , with a one-quarter twist instead of a one-third twist. For larger n one would use an n pointed ‘asterisk’ and a 1=n twist. Exercises 1.

The Klein bottle is usually pictured as a sub- space of R3 like the subspace X ˆ R 3 shown in the ﬁrst ﬁgure at the right.

In this problem we use the notions of suspension, reduced suspension, cone, and mapping cone deﬁned in Chapter 0. Let X be the subspace of R consisting of the sequence 1; 1=2; 1=3; 1=4; \u0001\u0001\u0001 together with its limit point 0 . (a) For the suspension SX , show that ˇ1—SX– is free on a countably inﬁnite set of generators, and deduce that ˇ1—SX– is countable. In contrast to this, the reduced suspension ÖX , obtained from SX by collapsing the segment f0g\u0002 I to a point, is the shrinking wedge of circles in Example 1.25, with an uncountable fundamental group. (b) Let C be the mapping cone of the quotient map SX!ÖX . Show that ˇ1—C– is un- countable by constructing a homomorphism from ˇ1—C– onto Q 1 Z= L 1 Z . Note Van Kampen’s Theorem Section 1.2 55 that C is the reduced suspension of the cone CX . Thus the reduced suspension of a contractible space need not be contractible, unlike the unreduced suspension. 19.

Show that the join X \u0003 Y of two nonempty spaces X and Y is simply-connected if X is path-connected. 22. In this exercise we describe an algorithm for computing a presentation of the fundamental group of the complement of a smooth or piecewise linear knot K in R3 , called the Wirtinger presentation. To begin, we position the knot to lie almost ﬂat on a table, so that K consists of ﬁnitely many disjoint arcs \u000bi where it intersects the table top together with ﬁnitely many disjoint arcs \f` where K crosses over itself. The conﬁguration at such a crossing is shown in the ﬁrst ﬁgure below. We build a ® ¯ T Ri Rk S Rj i ®j ®k ` ` Ri Rk Rj 2 dimensional complex X that is a deformation retract of R 3 − K by the following three steps. First, start with the rectangle T formed by the table top. Next, just above each arc \u000bi place a long, thin rectangular strip Ri , curved to run parallel to \u000bi along the full length of \u000bi and arched so that the two long edges of Ri are identiﬁed with points of T , as in the second ﬁgure. Any arcs \f` that cross over \u000bi are positioned to lie in Ri . Finally, over each arc \f` put a square S` , bent downward along its four edges so that these edges are identiﬁed with points of three strips Ri , Rj , and Rk as in the third ﬁgure; namely, two opposite edges of S` are identiﬁed with short edges of Rj and Rk and the other two opposite edges of S` are identiﬁed with two arcs crossing the interior of Ri . The knot K is now a subspace of X , but after we lift K up slightly into the complement of X , it becomes evident that X is a deformation retract of R 3 − K . (a) Assuming this bit of geometry, show that ˇ1—R3 − K– has a presentation with one generator xi for each strip Ri and one relation of the form xixjx−1 i … xk for each square S` , where the indices are as in the ﬁgures above. [To get the correct signs it is helpful to use an orientation of K .] (b) Use this presentation to show that the abelianization of ˇ1—R 3 − K– is Z . 56 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group We come now to the second main topic of this chapter, covering spaces. We have in fact already encountered one example of a covering space in our calculation of ˇ1—S 1– . This was the map R!S 1 that we pictured as the projection of a helix onto a circle, with the helix lying above the circle, ‘covering’ it. A number of things we proved for this covering space are valid for all covering spaces, and this allows covering spaces to serve as a useful general tool for calculating fundamental groups. But the connection between the fundamental group and covering spaces runs much deeper than this, and in many ways they can be regarded as two viewpoints toward the same thing. This means that algebraic features of the fundamental group can often be translated into the geometric language of covering spaces. This is exempliﬁed in one of the main results in this section, giving an exact correspondence between the various connected covering spaces of a given space X and subgroups of ˇ1—X– . This is strikingly reminiscent of Galois theory, with its correspondence between ﬁeld extensions and subgroups of the Galois group. Let us begin with the deﬁnition. A covering space of a space X is a space eX together with a map p : eX!X satisfying the following condition: There exists an open cover fU\u000bg of X such that for each \u000b , p−1—U\u000b– is a disjoint union of open sets in eX , each of which is mapped by p homeomorphically onto U\u000b . We do not require p−1—U\u000b– to be nonempty, so p need not be surjective. In the helix example one has p : R!S 1 given by p—t– … —cos 2ˇt; sin 2ˇt– , and the cover fU\u000bg can be taken to consist of any two open arcs whose union is S 1 . A related example is the helicoid surface S ˆ R 3 consisting of points of the form —s cos 2ˇt; s sin 2ˇt; t– for —s; t– 2 —0; 1–\u0002 R . This projects onto R 2 −f0g via the map —x;y;z– , —x; y– , and this projection deﬁnes a covering space p : S!R2 −f0g since for each open disk U in R2 −f0g , p−1—U– consists of countably many disjoint open disks in S , each mapped homeomorphically onto U by p . p Another example is the map p : S 1!S 1 , p—z– … zn where we view z as a complex number with jzj… 1 and n is any positive integer. The closest one can come to realizing this covering space as a linear projection in 3 space analogous to the projection of the helix is to draw a circle wrapping around a cylinder n times and intersecting itself in n − 1 points that one has to imagine are not really intersections. For an alternative picture without this defect, embed S 1 in the boundary torus of a solid torus S 1 \u0002 D2 so that it winds n times monotonically around the S 1 factor without self-intersections, then restrict the pro- jection S 1 \u0002 D2!S 1 \u0002f0g to this embedded circle. The ﬁgure for Example 1.29 in the preceding section illustrates the case n … 3. Covering Spaces Section 1.3 57 As our general theory will show, these examples for n \u0015 1 together with the helix example exhaust all the connected coverings spaces of S 1 . There are many other disconnected covering spaces of S 1 , such as n disjoint circles each mapped homeomorphically onto S 1 , but these disconnected covering spaces are just disjoint unions of connected ones. We will usually restrict our attention to connected covering spaces as these contain most of the interesting features of covering spaces. The covering spaces of S 1 _ S 1 form a remarkably rich family illustrating most of the general theory very concretely, so let us look at a few of these covering spaces to get an idea of what is going on. To abbreviate notation, set X … S 1 _ S 1 . We view this as a graph with one vertex and two edges. We label the edges b aa and b and we choose orientations for a and b . Now let eX be any other graph with four edges meeting at each vertex, and suppose the edges of eX have been assigned labels a and b and orientations in such a way that the local picture near each vertex is the same as in X , so there is an a edge oriented toward the vertex, an a edge oriented away from the vertex, a b edge oriented toward the vertex, and a b edge oriented away from the vertex. To give a name to this structure, let us call eX a2 oriented graph. The table on the next page shows just a small sample of the inﬁnite variety of possible examples. Given a 2 oriented graph eX we can construct a map p : eX!X sending all vertices of eX to the vertex of X and sending each edge of eX to the edge of X with the same label by a map that is a homeomorphism on the interior of the edge and preserves orientation. It is clear that the covering space condition is satisﬁed for p . The con- verse is also true: Every covering space of X is a graph that inherits a 2 orientation from X . As the reader will discover by experimentation, it seems that every graph having four edges incident at each vertex can be 2 oriented. This can be proved for ﬁnite graphs as follows. A very classical and easily shown fact is that every ﬁnite connected graph with an even number of edges incident at each vertex has an Eulerian circuit, a loop traversing each edge exactly once. If there are four edges at each vertex, then labeling the edges of an Eulerian circuit alternately a and b produces a labeling with two a and two b edges at each vertex. The union of the a edges is then a collection of disjoint circles, as is the union of the b edges. Choosing orientations for all these circles gives a 2 orientation. It is a theorem in graph theory that inﬁnite graphs with four edges incident at each vertex can also be 2 oriented; see Chapter 13 of [Koenig 1990] for a proof. There is also a generalization to n oriented graphs, which are covering spaces of the wedge sum of n circles. 58 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group a b b a ibabha, b , 2 - 1 a a a b b b habi a a a b b b a a b b a a a b b b a a a b b b a a aa a a a a a a a a b b b b b b b b b b b b b a a a a a a a a a a b b b b b b b b b b b b b b a aa 12 43 () () () () 5() 6() 7() 8() 9() 10() 11() 12() 13() 14() hai babha - 1i - 1 - 1ha ,, ,aba babb i 22 ha ,, , ,ab aabb i 22 2 - 1 - 1 - 1ha,, ,ba b bababb i 22 - 1 - 1ha ,, ,ab abb i 33 ha ,, ,ab bab i 33 ha ,, abb i 22 ha ,, , ,ab a bbab i 44 2 2 ha ,, , , , ,ab babbbab i 224 () ba 22() - 1 - 2 + 1- 2n - 2n- 1 abbh - n n | iZún abbh 2n abb 2n | iZún Some Covering Spaces of _S 1 S 1 Covering Spaces Section 1.3 59 A simply-connected covering space of X can be constructed in the following way. Start with the open intervals —−1; 1– in the coordinate axes of R 2 . Next, for a ﬁxed number \u0015 ,0 <\u0015< 1=2, for example \u0015 … 1=3, adjoin four open segments of length 2\u0015 , at distance \u0015 from the ends of the previous seg- ments and perpendicular to them, the new shorter seg- ments being bisected by the older ones. For the third stage, add perpendicular open segments of length 2\u0015 2 at distance \u0015 2 from the endpoints of all the previous segments and bisected by them. The process is now repeated indeﬁnitely, at the n th stage adding open segments of length 2\u0015 n−1 at dis- tance \u0015n−1 from all the previous endpoints. The union of all these open segments is a graph, with vertices the intersection points of horizontal and vertical segments, and edges the subsegments between adjacent vertices. We label all the horizontal edges a , oriented to the right, and all the vertical edges b , oriented upward. This covering space is called the universal cover of X because, as our general theory will show, it is a covering space of every other connected covering space of X . The covering spaces (1)–(14) in the table are all nonsimply-connected. Their fun- damental groups are free with bases represented by the loops speciﬁed by the listed words in a and b , starting at the basepoint ex0 indicated by the heavily shaded ver- tex. This can be proved in each case by applying van Kampen’s theorem. One can also interpret the list of words as generators of the image subgroup p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 in ˇ1—X; x0– … a; b \u000b . A general fact we shall prove about covering spaces is that the induced map p\u0003 : ˇ1— eX; ex0–!ˇ1—X; x0– is always injective. Thus we have the at- ﬁrst-glance paradoxical fact that the free group on two generators can contain as a subgroup a free group on any ﬁnite number of generators, or even on a countably inﬁnite set of generators as in examples (10) and (11). Changing the basepoint vertex changes the subgroup p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 to a conju- gate subgroup in ˇ1—X; x0– . The conjugating element of ˇ1—X; x0– is represented by any loop that is the projection of a path in eX joining one basepoint to the other. For example, the covering spaces (3) and (4) differ only in the choice of basepoints, and the corresponding subgroups of ˇ1—X; x0– differ by conjugation by b . The main classiﬁcation theorem for covering spaces says that by associating the subgroup p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 to the covering space p : eX!X , we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between all the different connected covering spaces of X and the conjugacy classes of subgroups of ˇ1—X; x0– . If one keeps track of the basepoint vertex ex0 2 eX , then this is a one-to-one correspondence between covering spaces p : — eX; ex0–!—X; x0– and actual subgroups of ˇ1—X; x0– , not just conjugacy classes. Of course, for these statements to make sense one has to have a precise notion of when two covering spaces are the same, or ‘isomorphic.’ In the case at hand, an iso- 60 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group morphism between covering spaces of X is just a graph isomorphism that preserves the labeling and orientations of edges. Thus the covering spaces in (3) and (4) are isomorphic, but not by an isomorphism preserving basepoints, so the two subgroups of ˇ1—X; x0– corresponding to these covering spaces are distinct but conjugate. On the other hand, the two covering spaces in (5) and (6) are not isomorphic, though the graphs are homeomorphic, so the corresponding subgroups of ˇ1—X; x0– are isomor- phic but not conjugate. Some of the covering spaces (1)–(14) are more symmetric than others, where by a ‘symmetry’ we mean an automorphism of the graph preserving the labeling and orientations. The most symmetric covering spaces are those having symmetries taking any one vertex onto any other. The examples (1), (2), (5)–(8), and (11) are the ones with this property. We shall see that a covering space of X has maximal symmetry exactly when the corresponding subgroup of ˇ1—X; x0– is a normal subgroup, and in this case the symmetries form a group isomorphic to the quotient group of ˇ1—X; x0– by the normal subgroup. Since every group generated by two elements is a quotient group of Z \u0003 Z , this implies that every two-generator group is the symmetry group of some covering space of X . Lifting Properties Covering spaces are deﬁned in fairly geometric terms, as maps p : eX!X that are local homeomorphisms in a rather strong sense. But from the viewpoint of algebraic topology, the distinctive feature of covering spaces is their behavior with respect to lifting of maps. Recall the terminology from the proof of Theorem 1.7: A lift of a map f : Y!X is a map ef : Y! eX such that p ef … f . We will describe three special lifting properties of covering spaces, and derive a few applications of these. First we have the homotopy lifting property,or covering homotopy property, as it is sometimes called: Proposition 1.30. Given a covering space p : eX!X , a homotopy ft : Y!X , and a map ef0 : Y! eX lifting f0 , then there exists a unique homotopy eft : Y! eX of ef0 that lifts ft . Proof: For the covering space p : R!S 1 this is property (c) in the proof of Theo- rem 1.7, and the proof there applies to any covering space. tu Taking Y to be a point gives the path lifting property for a covering space p : eX!X , which says that for each path f : I!X and each lift ex0 of the starting point f—0– … x0 there is a unique path ef : I! eX lifting f starting at ex0 . In particular, the uniqueness of lifts implies that every lift of a constant path is constant, but this could be deduced more simply from the fact that p−1—x0– has the discrete topology, by the deﬁnition of a covering space. Covering Spaces Section 1.3 61 Taking Y to be I , we see that every homotopy ft of a path f0 in X lifts to a homotopy eft of each lift ef0 of f0 . The lifted homotopy eft is a homotopy of paths, ﬁxing the endpoints, since as t varies each endpoint of eft traces out a path lifting a constant path, which must therefore be constant. Here is a simple application: Proposition 1.31. The map p\u0003 : ˇ1— eX; ex0–!ˇ1—X; x0– induced by a covering space p : — eX; ex0–!—X; x0– is injective. The image subgroup p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 in ˇ1—X; x0– consists of the homotopy classes of loops in X based at x0 whose lifts to eX starting at ex0 are loops. Proof: An element of the kernel of p\u0003 is represented by a loop ef0 : I! eX with a homotopy ft : I!X of f0 … p ef0 to the trivial loop f1 . By the remarks preceding the proposition, there is a lifted homotopy of loops eft starting with ef0 and ending with a constant loop. Hence ƒ ef0⁄ … 0in ˇ1— eX; ex0– and p\u0003 is injective. For the second statement of the proposition, loops at x0 lifting to loops at ex0 certainly represent elements of the image of p\u0003 : ˇ1— eX; ex0–!ˇ1—X; x0– . Conversely, a loop representing an element of the image of p\u0003 is homotopic to a loop having such a lift, so by homotopy lifting, the loop itself must have such a lift. tu If p : eX!X is a covering space, then the cardinality of the set p−1—x– is locally constant over X . Hence if X is connected, this cardinality is constant as x ranges over all of X . It is called the number of sheets of the covering. Proposition 1.32. The number of sheets of a covering space p : — eX; ex0–!—X; x0– with X and eX path-connected equals the index of p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 in ˇ1—X; x0– . Proof: For a loop g in X based at x0 , let eg be its lift to eX starting at ex0 . A product h g with ƒh⁄ 2 H … p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 has the lift eh eg ending at the same point as eg since eh is a loop. Thus we may deﬁne a function Ø from cosets Hƒg⁄ to p−1—x0– by sending Hƒg⁄ to eg—1– . The path-connectedness of eX implies that Ø is surjective since ex0 can be joined to any point in p−1—x0– by a path eg projecting to a loop g at x0 . To see that Ø is injective, observe that Ø—Hƒg1⁄– … Ø—Hƒg2⁄– implies that g1g2 lifts to a loop in eX based at ex0 ,so ƒg1⁄ƒg2⁄ −1 2 H and hence Hƒg1⁄ … Hƒg2⁄ . tu It is important also to know about the existence and uniqueness of lifts of general maps, not just lifts of homotopies. For the existence question an answer is provided by the following lifting criterion: Proposition 1.33. Suppose given a covering space p : — eX; ex0–!—X; x0– and a map f : —Y ; y0–!—X; x0– with Y path-connected and locally path-connected. Then a lift ef : —Y ; y0–!— eX; ex0– of f exists iff f\u0003( ˇ1—Y ; y0–\u0001 ˆ p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 . 62 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group When we say a space has a certain property locally, such as being locally path- connected, we shall mean that each point has arbitrarily small open neighborhoods with this property. Thus for Y to be locally path-connected means that for each point y 2 Y and each neighborhood U of y there is an open neighborhood V ˆ U of y that is path-connected. Some authors weaken the requirement that V be path- connected to the condition that any two points in V be joinable by a path in U . This broader deﬁnition would work just as well for our purposes, necessitating only small adjustments in the proofs, but for simplicity we shall use the more restrictive deﬁnition. Proof: The ‘only if’ statement is obvious since f\u0003 … p\u0003 ef\u0003 . For the converse, let y 2 Y and let γ be a path in Y from y0 to y . The path fγ in X starting at x0 has a unique lift gfγ starting at ex0 . Deﬁne ef—y– … gfγ—1– . To show this is well- deﬁned, independent of the choice of γ , let γ0 be another path from y0 to y . Then —f γ0– —fγ– is a loop h0 at x0 with ƒh0⁄ 2 f\u0003( ˇ1—Y ; y0–\u0001 ˆ p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 . This means there is a homotopy ht of h0 to a loop h1 that lifts to a loop eh1 in eX based at ex0 . Apply the covering homotopy property to ht to get a lifting eht . Since eh1 is a loop at ex0 ,sois eh0 . By the uniqueness of lifted paths, the ﬁrst half of eh0 is gfγ0 and the second half is gfγ traversed backwards, with the common midpoint gfγ—1– … gfγ0—1– . This shows that ef is well-deﬁned. °° y y yff p f °f x0 0 () 0 ° 0 f fg g° yf ff f °f x0 () 0 To see that ef is continuous, let U ˆ X be an open neighborhood of f—y– having a lift eU ˆ eX containing ef—y– such that p : eU!U is a homeomorphism. Choose a path-connected open neighborhood V of y with f—V – ˆ U . For paths from y0 to points y 0 2 V we can take a ﬁxed path γ from y0 to y followed by paths \u0011 in V from y to the points y 0 . Then the paths —f γ– —f \u0011– in X have lifts —gfγ– —gf\u0011– where gf\u0011 … p−1f\u0011 and p−1 : U! eU is the inverse of p : eU!U . Thus ef—V – ˆ eU and ef jV … p−1f , hence ef is continuous at y . tu An example showing the necessity of the local path-connectedness assumption on Y is described in Exercise 7 at the end of this section. Next we have the unique lifting property: Proposition 1.34. Given a covering space p : eX!X and a map f : Y!X with two lifts ef1; ef2 : Y! eX that agree at one point of Y , then if Y is connected, these two lifts must agree on all of Y . Proof: For a point y 2 Y , let U be an open neighborhood of f—y– in X for which p−1—U– is a disjoint union of open sets eU\u000b each mapped homeomorphically to U Covering Spaces Section 1.3 63 by p , and let eU1 and eU2 be the eU\u000b ’s containing ef1—y– and ef2—y– , respectively. By continuity of ef1 and ef2 there is a neighborhood N of y mapped into eU1 by ef1 and into eU2 by ef2 .If ef1—y– ﬂ ef2—y– then eU1 ﬂ eU2 , hence eU1 and eU2 are disjoint and ef1 ﬂ ef2 throughout the neighborhood N . On the other hand, if ef1—y– … ef2—y– then eU1 … eU2 so ef1 … ef2 on N since p ef1 … p ef2 and p is injective on eU1 … eU2 . Thus the set of points where ef1 and ef2 agree is both open and closed in Y . tu The Classiﬁcation of Covering Spaces We consider next the problem of classifying all the different covering spaces of a ﬁxed space X . Since the whole chapter is about paths, it should not be surprising that we will restrict attention to spaces X that are at least locally path-connected. Path-components of X are then the same as components, and for the purpose of classifying the covering spaces of X there is no loss in assuming that X is connected, or equivalently, path-connected. Local path-connectedness is inherited by covering spaces, so these too are connected iff they are path-connected. The main thrust of the classiﬁcation will be the Galois correspondence between connected covering spaces of X and subgroups of ˇ1—X– , but when this is ﬁnished we will also describe a different method of classiﬁcation that includes disconnected covering spaces as well. The Galois correspondence arises from the function that assigns to each covering space p : — eX; ex0–!—X; x0– the subgroup p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 of ˇ1—X; x0– . First we con- sider whether this function is surjective. That is, we ask whether every subgroup of ˇ1—X; x0– is realized as p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 for some covering space p : — eX; ex0–!—X; x0– . In particular we can ask whether the trivial subgroup is realized. Since p\u0003 is always injective, this amounts to asking whether X has a simply-connnected covering space. Answering this will take some work. A necessary condition for X to have a simply-connected covering space is the following: Each point x 2 X has a neighborhood U such that the inclusion-induced map ˇ1—U; x–!ˇ1—X; x– is trivial; one says X is semilocally simply-connected if this holds. To see the necessity of this condition, suppose p : eX!X is a covering space with eX simply-connected. Every point x 2 X has a neighborhood U having a lift eU ˆ eX projecting homeomorphically to U by p . Each loop in U lifts to a loop in eU , and the lifted loop is nullhomotopic in eX since ˇ1— eX– … 0 . So, composing this nullhomotopy with p , the original loop in U is nullhomotopic in X . A locally simply-connected space is certainly semilocally simply-connected. For example, CW complexes have the much stronger property of being locally contractible, as we show in the Appendix. An example of a space that is not semilocally simply- connected is the shrinking wedge of circles, the subspace X ˆ R 2 consisting of the circles of radius 1=n centered at the point —1=n; 0– for n … 1; 2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 , introduced in Exam- ple 1.25. On the other hand, the cone CX … —X \u0002 I–=—X \u0002f0g– is semilocally simply- connected since it is contractible, but it is not locally simply-connected. 64 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group We shall now show how to construct a simply-connected covering space of X if X is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semilocally simply-connected. To motivate the construction, suppose p : — eX; ex0–!—X; x0– is a simply-connected cover- ing space. Each point ex 2 eX can then be joined to ex0 by a unique homotopy class of paths, by Proposition 1.6, so we can view points of eX as homotopy classes of paths starting at ex0 . The advantage of this is that, by the homotopy lifting property, homo- topy classes of paths in eX starting at ex0 are the same as homotopy classes of paths in X starting at x0 . This gives a way of describing eX purely in terms of X . Given a path-connected, locally path-connected, semilocally simply-connected space X with a basepoint x0 2 X , we are therefore led to deﬁne eX … \b ƒγ⁄ jjjj γ is a path in X starting at x0 } where, as usual, ƒγ⁄ denotes the homotopy class of γ with respect to homotopies that ﬁx the endpoints γ—0– and γ—1– . The function p : eX!X sending ƒγ⁄ to γ—1– is then well-deﬁned. Since X is path-connected, the endpoint γ—1– can be any point of X ,so p is surjective. Before we deﬁne a topology on eX we make a few preliminary observations. Let U be the collection of path-connected open sets U ˆ X such that ˇ1—U–!ˇ1—X– is trivial. Note that if the map ˇ1—U–!ˇ1—X– is trivial for one choice of basepoint in U , it is trivial for all choices of basepoint since U is path-connected. A path-connected open subset V ˆ U 2 U is also in U since the composition ˇ1—V –!ˇ1—U–!ˇ1—X– will also be trivial. It follows that U is a basis for the topology on X if X is locally path-connected and semilocally simply-connected. Given a set U 2 U and a path γ in X from x0 to a point in U , let Uƒγ⁄ … \b ƒγ \u0011⁄ jjjj \u0011 is a path in U with \u0011—0– … γ—1– } As the notation indicates, Uƒγ⁄ depends only on the homotopy class ƒγ⁄ . Observe that p : Uƒγ⁄!U is surjective since U is path-connected and injective since differ- ent choices of \u0011 joining γ—1– to a ﬁxed x 2 U are all homotopic in X , the map ˇ1—U–!ˇ1—X– being trivial. Another property is —\u0003– Uƒγ⁄ … Uƒγ0⁄ if ƒγ0⁄ 2 Uƒγ⁄ . For if γ0 … γ \u0011 then elements of Uƒγ0⁄ have the form ƒγ \u0011 \u0016⁄ and hence lie in Uƒγ⁄ , while elements of Uƒγ⁄ have the form ƒγ \u0016⁄ … ƒγ \u0011 \u0011 \u0016⁄ … ƒγ0 \u0011 \u0016⁄ and hence lie in Uƒγ0⁄ . This can be used to show that the sets Uƒγ⁄ form a basis for a topology on eX . For if we are given two such sets Uƒγ⁄ , Vƒγ0⁄ and an element ƒγ00⁄ 2 Uƒγ⁄ \\ Vƒγ0⁄ , we have Uƒγ⁄ … Uƒγ00⁄ and Vƒγ0⁄ … Vƒγ00⁄ by —\u0003– .So if W 2 U is contained in U \\ V and contains γ00—1– then Wƒγ00⁄ ˆ Uƒγ00⁄ \\ Vƒγ00⁄ and ƒγ00⁄ 2 Wƒγ00⁄ . The bijection p : Uƒγ⁄!U is a homeomorphism since it gives a bijection between the subsets Vƒγ0⁄ ˆ Uƒγ⁄ and the sets V 2 U contained in U . Namely, in one direction we have p—Vƒγ0⁄– … V and in the other direction we have p−1—V – \\ Uƒγ⁄ … Vƒγ0⁄ for Covering Spaces Section 1.3 65 any ƒγ0⁄ 2 Uƒγ⁄ with endpoint in V , since Vƒγ0⁄ ˆ Uƒγ0⁄ … Uƒγ⁄ and Vƒγ0⁄ maps onto V by the bijection p . The preceding paragraph implies that p : eX!X is continuous. We can also de- duce that this is a covering space since for ﬁxed U 2 U , the sets Uƒγ⁄ for varying ƒγ⁄ partition p−1—U– because if ƒγ00⁄ 2 Uƒγ⁄ \\ Uƒγ0⁄ then Uƒγ⁄ … Uƒγ00⁄ … Uƒγ0⁄ by —\u0003– . It remains only to show that eX is simply-connected. For a point ƒγ⁄ 2 eX let γt be the path in X obtained by restricting γ to the interval ƒ0;t⁄ . Then the function t,ƒγt⁄ is a path in eX lifting γ that starts at ƒx0⁄ , the homotopy class of the constant path at x0 , and ends at ƒγ⁄ . Since ƒγ⁄ was an arbitrary point in eX , this shows that eX is path-connected. To show that ˇ1— eX; ƒx0⁄– … 0 it sufﬁces to show that the image of this group under p\u0003 is trivial since p\u0003 is injective. Elements in the image of p\u0003 are represented by loops γ at x0 that lift to loops in eX at ƒx0⁄ . We have observed that the path t , ƒγt⁄ lifts γ starting at ƒx0⁄ , and for this lifted path to be a loop means that ƒγ1⁄ … ƒx0⁄ . Since γ1 … γ , this says that ƒγ⁄ … ƒx0⁄ ,so γ is nullhomotopic and the image of p\u0003 is trivial. This completes the construction of a simply-connected covering space eX!X . In concrete cases one usually constructs a simply-connected covering space by more direct methods. For example, suppose X is the union of subspaces A and B for which simply-connected covering spaces eA!A and eB!B are already known. Then one can attempt to build a simply-connected covering space eX!X by assembling copies of eA and eB . For example, for X … S 1 _ S 1 , if we take A and B to be the two circles, then eA and eB are each R , and we can build the simply-connected cover eX described earlier in this section by glueing together inﬁnitely many copies of eA and eB , the horizontal and vertical lines in eX . Here is another illustration of this method: Example 1.35. For integers m; n \u0015 2 , let Xm;n be the quotient space of a cylinder S 1 \u0002 I under the identiﬁcations —z; 0– ˘ —e2ˇ i=mz; 0– and —z; 1– ˘ —e2ˇ i=nz; 1– . Let A ˆ X and B ˆ X be the quotients of S 1 \u0002 ƒ0; 1=2⁄ and S 1 \u0002 ƒ1=2; 1⁄,so A and B are the mapping cylinders of z , zm and z , zn , with A \\ B … S 1 . The simplest case is m … n … 2 , when A and B are M¨obius bands and X2;2 is the Klein bottle. We encountered the complexes Xm;n previously in analyzing torus knot complements in Example 1.24. The ﬁgure for Example 1.29 at the end of the preceding section shows what A looks like in the typical case m … 3 . We have ˇ1—A– ˇ Z , and the universal cover eA is homeomorphic to a product Cm \u0002 R where Cm is the graph that is a cone on m points, as shown in the ﬁgure to the right. The situation for B is similar, and eB is homeomorphic to Cn \u0002 R . Now we attempt to build the universal cover eXm;n from copies of eA and eB . Start with a copy of eA . Its boundary, the outer edges of its ﬁns, consists of m copies of R . Along each of these m boundary 66 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group lines we attach a copy of eB . Each of these copies of eB has one of its boundary lines attached to the initial copy of eA , leaving n − 1 boundary lines free, and we attach a new copy of eA to each of these free boundary lines. Thus we now have m—n − 1– ‡ 1 copies of eA . Each of the newly attached copies of eA has m − 1 free boundary lines, and to each of these lines we attach a new copy of eB . The process is now repeated ad inﬁnitim in the evident way. Let eXm;n be the resulting space. The product structures eA … Cm \u0002 R and eB … Cn \u0002 R give eXm;n the structure of a product Tm;n \u0002 R where Tm;n is an inﬁnite graph constructed by an inductive scheme just like the construction of eXm;n . Thus Tm;n is the union of a sequence of ﬁnite subgraphs, each obtained from the preceding by attaching new copies of Cm or Cn . Each of these ﬁnite subgraphs deformation retracts onto the preceding one. The inﬁnite concatenation of these defor- mation retractions, with the k th graph deformation retracting to the previous one during the time interval ƒ1=2k; 1=2 k−1⁄ , gives a deformation retraction of Tm;n onto the initial stage Cm . Since Cm is contractible, this means Tm;n is contractible, hence also eXm;n , which is the product Tm;n \u0002 R . In particular, eXm;n is simply-connected. The map that projects each copy of eA in eXm;n to A and each copy of eB to B is a covering space. To deﬁne this map precisely, choose a point x0 2 S 1 , and then the image of the line segment fx0g\u0002 I in Xm;n meets A in a line segment whose preimage in eA consists of an inﬁnite number of line segments, appearing in the earlier ﬁgure as the horizontal segments spi- raling around the central vertical axis. The picture in eB is similar, and when we glue together all the copies of eA and eB to form eXm;n , we do so in such a way that these horizontal segments always line up exactly. This decomposes eXm;n into inﬁnitely many rectangles, each formed from a rectangle in an eA and a rectangle in a eB . The covering projection eXm;n!Xm;n is the quotient map that identiﬁes all these rectangles. Now we return to the general theory. The hypotheses for constructing a simply- connected covering space of X in fact sufﬁce for constructing covering spaces realiz- ing arbitrary subgroups of ˇ1—X– : Proposition 1.36. Suppose X is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semilo- cally simply-connected. Then for every subgroup H ˆ ˇ1—X; x0– there is a covering space p : XH!X such that p\u0003( ˇ1—XH ; ex0–\u0001 … H for a suitably chosen basepoint ex0 2 XH . Proof: For points ƒγ⁄ , ƒγ0⁄ in the simply-connected covering space eX constructed above, deﬁne ƒγ⁄ ˘ ƒγ0⁄ to mean γ—1– … γ0—1– and ƒγγ0⁄ 2 H . It is easy to see Covering Spaces Section 1.3 67 that this is an equivalence relation since H is a subgroup; namely, it is reﬂexive since H contains the identity element, symmetric since H is closed under inverses, and transitive since H is closed under multiplication. Let XH be the quotient space of eX obtained by identifying ƒγ⁄ with ƒγ0⁄ if ƒγ⁄ ˘ ƒγ0⁄ . Note that if γ—1– … γ0—1– , then ƒγ⁄ ˘ ƒγ0⁄ iff ƒγ\u0011⁄ ˘ ƒγ0\u0011⁄ . This means that if any two points in basic neighborhoods Uƒγ⁄ and Uƒγ0⁄ are identiﬁed in XH then the whole neighborhoods are identiﬁed. Hence the natural projection XH!X induced by ƒγ⁄ , γ—1– is a covering space. If we choose for the basepoint ex0 2 XH the equivalence class of the constant path c at x0 , then the image of p\u0003 : ˇ1—XH ; ex0–!ˇ1—X; x0– is exactly H . This is because for a loop γ in X based at x0 , its lift to eX starting at ƒc⁄ ends at ƒγ⁄ , so the image of this lifted path in XH is a loop iff ƒγ⁄ ˘ ƒc⁄ , or equivalently, ƒγ⁄ 2 H . tu Having taken care of the existence of covering spaces of X corresponding to all subgroups of ˇ1—X– , we turn now to the question of uniqueness. More speciﬁcally, we are interested in uniqueness up to isomorphism, where an isomorphism between covering spaces p1 : eX1!X and p2 : eX2!X is a homeomorphism f : eX1! eX2 such that p1 … p2f . This condition means exactly that f preserves the covering space structures, taking p−1 1 —x– to p−1 2 —x– for each x 2 X . The inverse f −1 is then also an isomorphism, and the composition of two isomorphisms is an isomorphism, so we have an equivalence relation. Proposition 1.37. If X is path-connected and locally path-connected, then two path- connected covering spaces p1 : eX1!X and p2 : eX2!X are isomorphic via an isomor- phism f : eX1! eX2 taking a basepoint ex1 2 p−1 1 —x0– to a basepoint ex2 2 p−1 2 —x0– iff p1\u0003( ˇ1— eX1; ex1–\u0001 … p2\u0003( ˇ1— eX2; ex2–\u0001 . Proof: If there is an isomorphism f : — eX1; ex1–!— eX2; ex2– , then from the two relations p1 … p2f and p2 … p1f −1 it follows that p1\u0003( ˇ1— eX1; ex1–\u0001 … p2\u0003( ˇ1— eX2; ex2–\u0001 . Con- versely, suppose that p1\u0003( ˇ1— eX1; ex1–\u0001 … p2\u0003( ˇ1— eX2; ex2–\u0001 . By the lifting criterion, we may lift p1 to a map ep1 : — eX1; ex1–!— eX2; ex2– with p2 ep1 … p1 . Symmetrically, we obtain ep2 : — eX2; ex2–!— eX1; ex1– with p1 ep2 … p2 . Then by the unique lifting property, ep1 ep2 … 11 and ep2 ep1 … 11 since these composed lifts ﬁx the basepoints. Thus ep1 and ep2 are inverse isomorphisms. tu We have proved the ﬁrst half of the following classiﬁcation theorem: Theorem 1.38. Let X be path-connected, locally path-connected, and semilocally simply-connected. Then there is a bijection between the set of basepoint-preserving isomorphism classes of path-connected covering spaces p : — eX; ex0–!—X; x0– and the set of subgroups of ˇ1—X; x0– , obtained by associating the subgroup p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 to the covering space — eX; ex0– . If basepoints are ignored, this correspondence gives a bijection between isomorphism classes of path-connected covering spaces p : eX!X and conjugacy classes of subgroups of ˇ1—X; x0– . 68 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group Proof: It remains only to prove the last statement. We show that for a covering space p : — eX; ex0–!—X; x0– , changing the basepoint ex0 within p−1—x0– corresponds exactly to changing p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 to a conjugate subgroup of ˇ1—X; x0– . Suppose that ex1 is another basepoint in p−1—x0– , and let eγ be a path from ex0 to ex1 . Then eγ projects to a loop γ in X representing some element g 2 ˇ1—X; x0– . Set Hi … p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; exi–\u0001 for i … 0; 1 . We have an inclusion g−1H0g ˆ H1 since for ef a loop at ex0 , eγ ef eγ is a loop at ex1 . Similarly we have gH1g−1 ˆ H0 . Conjugating the latter relation by g−1 gives H1 ˆ g−1H0g ,so g−1H0g … H1 . Thus, changing the basepoint from ex0 to ex1 changes H0 to the conjugate subgroup H1 … g−1H0g . Conversely, to change H0 to a conjugate subgroup H1 … g−1H0g , choose a loop γ representing g , lift this to a path eγ starting at ex0 , and let ex1 … eγ—1– . The preceding argument then shows that we have the desired relation H1 … g−1H0g . tu A consequence of the lifting criterion is that a simply-connected covering space of a path-connected, locally path-connected space X is a covering space of every other path-connected covering space of X . A simply-connected covering space of X is therefore called a universal cover. It is unique up to isomorphism, so one is justiﬁed in calling it the universal cover. More generally, there is a partial ordering on the various path-connected covering spaces of X , according to which ones cover which others. This corresponds to the partial ordering by inclusion of the corresponding subgroups of ˇ1—X– , or conjugacy classes of subgroups if basepoints are ignored. Representing Covering Spaces by Permutations We wish to describe now another way of classifying the different covering spaces of a connected, locally path-connected, semilocally simply-connected space X , with- out restricting just to connected covering spaces. To give the idea, con- sider the 3 sheeted covering spaces of S 1 . There are three of these, eX1 , eX2 , and eX3 , with the subscript indicating the number of compo- nents. For each of these covering spaces p : eXi!S 1 the three different lifts of a loop in S 1 generating ˇ1—S 1;x0– determine a permutation of p−1—x0– sending the starting point of the lift to the ending point of the lift. For eX1 this is a cyclic permutation, for eX2 it is a transposition of two points ﬁxing the third point, and for eX3 it is the identity permu- tation. These permutations obviously determine the covering spaces uniquely, up to isomorphism. The same would be true for n sheeted covering spaces of S 1 for arbitrary n , even for n inﬁnite. The covering spaces of S 1 _ S 1 can be encoded using the same idea. Referring back to the large table of examples near the beginning of this section, we see in the covering space (1) that the loop a lifts to the identity permutation of the two vertices and b lifts to the permutation that transposes the two vertices. In (2), both a and b Covering Spaces Section 1.3 69 lift to transpositions of the two vertices. In (3) and (4), a and b lift to transpositions of different pairs of the three vertices, while in (5) and (6) they lift to cyclic permutations of the vertices. In (11) the vertices can be labeled by Z , with a lifting to the identity permutation and b lifting to the shift n , n ‡ 1 . Indeed, one can see from these examples that a covering space of S 1 _ S 1 is nothing more than an efﬁcient graphical representation of a pair of permutations of a given set. This idea of lifting loops to permutations generalizes to arbitrary covering spaces. For a covering space p : eX!X , a path γ in X has a unique lift eγ starting at a given point of p−1—γ—0–– , so we obtain a well-deﬁned map Lγ : p−1—γ—0––!p−1—γ—1–– by sending the starting point eγ—0– of each lift eγ to its ending point eγ—1– . It is evident that Lγ is a bijection since Lγ is its inverse. For a composition of paths γ\u0011 we have Lγ\u0011 … L\u0011Lγ , rather than LγL\u0011 , since composition of paths is written from left to right while composition of functions is written from right to left. To compensate for this, let us modify the deﬁnition by replacing Lγ by its inverse. Thus the new Lγ is a bijection p−1—γ—1––!p−1—γ—0–– , and Lγ\u0011 … LγL\u0011 . Since Lγ depends only on the homotopy class of γ , this means that if we restrict attention to loops at a basepoint x0 2 X , then the association γ , Lγ gives a homomorphism from ˇ1—X; x0– to the group of permutations of p−1—x0– . This is called the action of ˇ1—X; x0– on the ﬁber p−1—x0– . Let us see how the covering space p : eX!X can be reconstructed from the asso- ciated action of ˇ1—X; x0– on the ﬁber F … p−1—x0– , assuming that X is connected, path-connected, and semilocally simply-connected, so it has a universal cover eX0!X . We can take the points of eX0 to be homotopy classes of paths in X starting at x0 , as in the general construction of a universal cover. Deﬁne a map h : eX0 \u0002 F! eX send- ing a pair —ƒγ⁄; ex0– to eγ—1– where eγ is the lift of γ to eX starting at ex0 . Then h is continuous, and in fact a local homeomorphism, since a neighborhood of —ƒγ⁄; ex0– in eX0 \u0002 F consists of the pairs —ƒγ\u0011⁄; ex0– with \u0011 a path in a suitable neighborhood of γ—1– . It is obvious that h is surjective since X is path-connected. If h were injec- tive as well, it would be a homeomorphism, which is unlikely since eX is probably not homeomorphic to eX0 \u0002 F . Even if h is not injective, it will induce a homeomorphism from some quotient space of eX0 \u0002 F onto eX . To see what this quotient space is, suppose h—ƒγ⁄; ex0– … h—ƒγ0⁄; ex0 0– . Then γ and γ0 are both paths from x0 to the same endpoint, and from the ﬁgure we see that ex0 0 … Lγ0γ— ex0– . Letting \u0015 be the loop γ0γ , this ° ° x0 f f f° x0 fx0 0 0 ° 0 means that h—ƒγ⁄; ex0– … h—ƒ\u0015γ⁄; L\u0015— ex0–– . Conversely, for any loop \u0015 we have h—ƒγ⁄; ex0– … h—ƒ\u0015γ⁄; L\u0015— ex0–– . Thus h induces a well-deﬁned map to eX from the quotient space of eX0 \u0002 F obtained by identifying —ƒγ⁄; ex0– with —ƒ\u0015γ⁄; L\u0015— ex0–– for each ƒ\u0015⁄ 2 ˇ1—X; x0– . Let this quotient space be denoted eXˆ where ˆ is the ho- momorphism from ˇ1—X; x0– to the permutation group of F speciﬁed by the action. 70 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group Notice that the deﬁnition of eXˆ makes sense whenever we are given an action ˆ of ˇ1—X; x0– on a set F . There is a natural projection eXˆ!X sending —ƒγ⁄; ex0– to γ—1– , and this is a covering space since if U ˆ X is an open set over which the universal cover eX0 is a product U \u0002 ˇ1—X; x0– , then the identiﬁcations deﬁning eXˆ simply collapse U \u0002 ˇ1—X; x0–\u0002 F to U \u0002 F . Returning to our given covering space eX!X with associated action ˆ , the map eXˆ! eX induced by h is a bijection and therefore a homeomorphism since h was a local homeomorphism. Since this homeomorphism eXˆ! eX takes each ﬁber of eXˆ to the corresponding ﬁber of eX , it is an isomorphism of covering spaces. If two covering spaces p1 : eX1!X and p2 : eX2!X are isomorphic, one may ask how the corresponding actions of ˇ1—X; x0– on the ﬁbers F1 and F2 over x0 are related. An isomorphism h : eX1! eX2 restricts to a bijection F1!F2 , and evidently Lγ—h— ex0–– … h—Lγ— ex0–– . Using the less cumbersome notation γ ex0 for Lγ— ex0– , this relation can be written more concisely as γh— ex0– … h—γ ex0– . A bijection F1!F2 with this property is what one would naturally call an isomorphism of sets with ˇ1—X; x0– action. Thus isomorphic covering spaces have isomorphic actions on ﬁbers. The converse is also true, and easy to prove. One just observes that for isomorphic actions ˆ1 and ˆ2 , an isomorphism h : F1!F2 induces a map eXˆ1! eXˆ2 and h −1 induces a similar map in the opposite direction, such that the compositions of these two maps, in either order, are the identity. This shows that n sheeted covering spaces of X are classiﬁed by equivalence classes of homomorphisms ˇ1—X; x0–!Ön , where Ön is the symmetric group on n symbols and the equivalence relation identiﬁes a homomorphism ˆ with each of its conjugates h−1ˆh by elements h 2 Ön . The study of the various homomorphisms from a given group to Ön is a very classical topic in group theory, so we see that this algebraic question has a nice geometric interpretation. Deck Transformations and Group Actions For a covering space p : eX!X the isomorphisms eX! eX are called deck transfor- mations or covering transformations. These form a group G— eX– under composition. For example, for the covering space p : R!S 1 projecting a vertical helix onto a circle, the deck transformations are the vertical translations taking the helix onto itself, so G— eX– ˇ Z in this case. For the n sheeted covering space S 1!S 1 , z , zn , the deck transformations are the rotations of S 1 through angles that are multiples of 2ˇ=n , so G— eX– … Zn . By the unique lifting property, a deck transformation is completely determined by where it sends a single point, assuming eX is path-connected. In particular, only the identity deck transformation can ﬁx a point of eX . A covering space p : eX!X is called normal if for each x 2 X and each pair of lifts ex; ex0 of x there is a deck transformation taking ex to ex0. For example, the covering Covering Spaces Section 1.3 71 space R!S 1 and the n sheeted covering spaces S 1!S 1 are normal. Intuitively, a normal covering space is one with maximal symmetry. This can be seen in the covering spaces of S 1 _ S 1 shown in the table earlier in this section, where the normal covering spaces are (1), (2), (5)–(8), and (11). Note that in (7) the group of deck transformations is Z4 while in (8) it is Z2 \u0002 Z2 . Sometimes normal covering spaces are called regular covering spaces. The term ‘normal’ is motivated by the following result. Proposition 1.39. Let p : — eX; ex0–!—X; x0– be a path-connected covering space of the path-connected, locally path-connected space X , and let H be the subgroup p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 ˆ ˇ1—X; x0– . Then : (a) This covering space is normal iff H is a normal subgroup of ˇ1—X; x0– . (b) G— eX– is isomorphic to the quotient N—H–=H where N—H– is the normalizer of H in ˇ1—X; x0– . In particular, G— eX– is isomorphic to ˇ1—X; x0–=H if eX is a normal covering. Hence for the universal cover eX!X we have G— eX– ˇ ˇ1—X– . Proof: We observed earlier in the proof of the classiﬁcation theorem that changing the basepoint ex0 2 p−1—x0– to ex1 2 p−1—x0– corresponds precisely to conjugating H by an element ƒγ⁄ 2 ˇ1—X; x0– where γ lifts to a path eγ from ex0 to ex1 . Thus ƒγ⁄ is in the normalizer N—H– iff p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 … p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex1–\u0001 , which by the lifting criterion is equivalent to the existence of a deck transformation taking ex0 to ex1 . Hence the covering space is normal iff N—H– … ˇ1—X; x0– , that is, iff H is a normal subgroup of ˇ1—X; x0– . Deﬁne ' : N—H–!G— eX– sending ƒγ⁄ to the deck transformation ˝ taking ex0 to ex1 , in the notation above. Then ' is a homomorphism, for if γ0 is another loop corre- sponding to the deck transformation ˝ 0 taking ex0 to ex0 1 then γ γ0 lifts to eγ —˝— eγ0–– , a path from ex0 to ˝— ex0 1– … ˝˝ 0— ex0– ,so ˝˝ 0 is the deck transformation corresponding to ƒγ⁄ƒγ0⁄ . By the preceding paragraph ' is surjective. Its kernel consists of classes ƒγ⁄ lifting to loops in eX . These are exactly the elements of p\u0003( ˇ1— eX; ex0–\u0001 … H . tu The group of deck transformations is a special case of the general notion of ‘groups acting on spaces.’ Given a group G and a space Y , then an action of G on Y is a homomorphism ˆ from G to the group Homeo—Y – of all homeomorphisms from Y to itself. Thus to each g 2 G is associated a homeomorphism ˆ—g– : Y!Y , which for notational simplicity we write simply as g : Y!Y . For ˆ to be a homo- morphism amounts to requiring that g1—g2—y–– … —g1g2–—y– for all g1;g2 2 G and y 2 Y .If ˆ is injective then it identiﬁes G with a subgroup of Homeo—Y – , and in practice not much is lost in assuming ˆ is an inclusion G > Homeo—Y – since in any case the subgroup ˆ—G– ˆ Homeo—Y – contains all the topological information about the action. 72 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group We shall be interested in actions satisfying the following condition: —\u0003– Each y 2 Y has a neighborhood U such that all the images g—U– for varying g 2 G are disjoint. In other words, g1—U– \\ g2—U– ﬂ ; implies g1 … g2 . The action of the deck transformation group G— eX– on eX satisﬁes —\u0003– . To see this, let eU ˆ eX project homeomorphically to U ˆ X .If g1— eU– \\ g2— eU– ﬂ ; for some g1;g2 2 G— eX– , then g1— ex1– … g2— ex2– for some ex1; ex2 2 eU . Since ex1 and ex2 must lie in the same set p−1—x– , which intersects eU in only one point, we must have ex1 … ex2 . Then g−1 1 g2 ﬁxes this point, so g−1 1 g2 … 11 and g1 … g2 . Note that in —\u0003– it sufﬁces to take g1 to be the identity since g1—U– \\ g2—U– ﬂ ; is equivalent to U \\ g−1 1 g2—U– ﬂ ; . Thus we have the equivalent condition that U \\ g—U– ﬂ ; only when g is the identity. Given an action of a group G on a space Y , we can form a space Y=G , the quotient space of Y in which each point y is identiﬁed with all its images g—y– as g ranges over G . The points of Y=G are thus the orbits Gy …f g—y– j g 2 G g in Y , and Y=G is called the orbit space of the action. For example, for a normal covering space eX!X , the orbit space eX=G— eX– is just X . Proposition 1.40. If an action of a group G on a space Y satisﬁes —\u0003– , then : (a) The quotient map p : Y!Y=G , p—y– … Gy , is a normal covering space. (b) G is the group of deck transformations of this covering space Y!Y=G if Y is path-connected. (c) G is isomorphic to ˇ1—Y =G–=p\u0003( ˇ1—Y – \u0001 if Y is path-connected and locally path- connected. Proof: Given an open set U ˆ Y as in condition —\u0003– , the quotient map p simply identiﬁes all the disjoint homeomorphic sets f g—U– j g 2 G g to a single open set p—U – in Y=G . By the deﬁnition of the quotient topology on Y=G , p restricts to a homeomorphism from g—U– onto p—U – for each g 2 G so we have a covering space. Each element of G acts as a deck transformation, and the covering space is normal since g2g−1 1 takes g1—U– to g2—U– . The deck transformation group contains G as a subgroup, and equals this subgroup if Y is path-connected, since if f is any deck transformation, then for an arbitrarily chosen point y 2 Y , y and f—y– are in the same orbit and there is a g 2 G with g—y– … f—y– , hence f … g since deck transformations of a path-connected covering space are uniquely determined by where they send a point. The ﬁnal statement of the proposition is immediate from part (b) of Proposition 1.39. tu In view of the preceding proposition, we shall call an action satisfying —\u0003– a covering space action. This is not standard terminology, but there does not seem to be a universally accepted name for actions satisfying —\u0003– . Sometimes these are called ‘properly discontinuous’ actions, but more often this rather unattractive term means Covering Spaces Section 1.3 73 something weaker: Every point x 2 X has a neighborhood U such that U \\ g—U– is nonempty for only ﬁnitely many g 2 G . Many symmetry groups have this proper discontinuity property without satisfying —\u0003– , for example the group of symmetries of the familiar tiling of R2 by regular hexagons. The reason why the action of this group on R2 fails to satisfy —\u0003– is that there are ﬁxed points: points y for which there is a nontrivial element g 2 G with g—y– … y . For example, the vertices of the hexagons are ﬁxed by the 120 degree rotations about these points, and the midpoints of edges are ﬁxed by 180 degree rotations. An action without ﬁxed points is called a free action. Thus for a free action of G on Y , only the identity element of G ﬁxes any point of Y . This is equivalent to requiring that all the images g—y– of each y 2 Y are distinct, or in other words g1—y– … g2—y– only when g1 … g2 , since g1—y– … g2—y– is equivalent to g−1 1 g2—y– … y . Though condition —\u0003– implies freeness, the converse is not always true. An example is the action of Z on S 1 in which a generator of Z acts by rotation through an angle \u000b that is an irrational multiple of 2ˇ . In this case each orbit Zy is dense in S 1 , so condition —\u0003– cannot hold since it implies that orbits are discrete subspaces. An exercise at the end of the section is to show that for actions on Hausdorff spaces, freeness plus proper discontinuity implies condition —\u0003– . Note that proper discontinuity is automatic for actions by a ﬁnite group. Example 1.41. Let Y be the closed orientable surface of genus 11, an ‘11 hole torus’ as shown in the ﬁgure. This has a 5 fold rotational symme- try, generated by a rotation of angle 2ˇ=5 . Thus we have the cyclic group Z5 acting on Y , and the condition —\u0003– is obviously satisﬁed. The quotient space Y=Z5 is a surface C 2 C1 C 3C4 C 5 C p of genus 3, obtained from one of the ﬁve subsurfaces of Y cut off by the circles C1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;C5 by identifying its two boundary circles Ci and Ci‡1 to form the circle C as shown. Thus we have a covering space M11!M3 where Mg denotes the closed orientable surface of genus g . In particular, we see that ˇ1—M3– contains the ‘larger’ group ˇ1—M11– as a normal subgroup of index 5 , with quotient Z5 . This example obviously generalizes by re- placing the two holes in each ‘arm’ of M11 by m holes and the 5 fold symmetry by n fold symmetry. This gives a covering space Mmn‡1!Mm‡1 . An exercise in x2.2 is to show by an Euler characteristic argument that if there is a covering space Mg!Mh then g … mn ‡ 1 and h … m ‡ 1 for some m and n . As a special case of the ﬁnal statement of the preceding proposition we see that for a covering space action of a group G on a simply-connected locally path-connected space Y , the orbit space Y=G has fundamental group isomorphic to G . Under this isomorphism an element g 2 G corresponds to a loop in Y=G that is the projection of 74 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group a path in Y from a chosen basepoint y0 to g—y0– . Any two such paths are homotopic since Y is simply-connected, so we get a well-deﬁned element of ˇ1—Y =G– associated to g . This method for computing fundamental groups via group actions on simply- connected spaces is essentially how we computed ˇ1—S 1– in x1.1, via the covering space R!S 1 arising from the action of Z on R by translations. This is a useful gen- eral technique for computing fundamental groups, in fact. Here are some examples illustrating this idea. Example 1.42. Consider the grid in R 2 formed by the horizontal and vertical lines through points in Z2 . Let us decorate this grid with arrows in either of the two ways shown in the ﬁgure, the difference between the two cases being that in the second case the horizontal arrows in adjacent lines point in opposition direc- tions. The group G consisting of all symmetries of the ﬁrst decorated grid is isomorphic to Z\u0002 Z since it consists of all translations —x; y– , —x ‡ m; y ‡ n– for m; n 2 Z . For the second grid the symmetry group G contains a subgroup of translations of the form —x; y– , —x ‡ m; y ‡ 2n– for m; n 2 Z , but there are also glide-reﬂection symme- tries consisting of vertical translation by an odd integer distance followed by reﬂection across a vertical line, either a vertical line of the grid or a vertical line halfway between two adjacent grid lines. For both decorated grids there are elements of G taking any square to any other, but only the identity element of G takes a square to itself. The minimum distance any point is moved by a nontrivial element of G is 1 , which easily implies the covering space condition —\u0003– . The orbit space R 2=G is the quotient space of a square in the grid with opposite edges identiﬁed according to the arrows. Thus we see that the fundamental groups of the torus and the Klein bottle are the symme- try groups G in the two cases. In the second case the subgroup of G formed by the translations has index two, and the orbit space for this subgroup is a torus forming a two-sheeted covering space of the Klein bottle. Example 1.43: RPn . The antipodal map of S n , x , −x , generates an action of Z2 on S n with orbit space RPn , real projective n space, as deﬁned in Example 0.4. The action is a covering space action since each open hemisphere in S n is disjoint from its antipodal image. As we saw in Proposition 1.14, S n is simply-connected if n \u0015 2, so from the covering space S n!RPn we deduce that ˇ1—RPn– ˇ Z2 for n \u0015 2. A generator for ˇ1—RPn– is any loop obtained by projecting a path in S n connecting two antipodal points. One can see explicitly that such a loop γ has order two in ˇ1—RPn– if n \u0015 2 since the composition γ γ lifts to a loop in S n , and this can be homotoped to the trivial loop since ˇ1—S n– … 0 , so the projection of this homotopy into RPn gives a nullhomotopy of γ γ . Covering Spaces Section 1.3 75 One may ask whether there are other ﬁnite groups that act freely on S n , deﬁning covering spaces S n!S n=G . We will show in Proposition 2.29 that Z2 is the only possibility when n is even, but for odd n the question is much more difﬁcult. It is easy to construct a free action of any cyclic group Zm on S 2k−1 , the action generated by the rotation v , e2ˇ i=mv of the unit sphere S 2k−1 in Ck … R 2k . This action is free since an equation v … e2ˇi`=mv with 0 <` <m implies v … 0 , but 0 is not a point of S 2k−1 . The orbit space S 2k−1=Zm is one of a family of spaces called lens spaces deﬁned in Example 2.43. There are also noncyclic ﬁnite groups that act freely as rotations of S n for odd n> 1 . These actions are classiﬁed quite explicitly in [Wolf 1984]. Examples in the simplest case n … 3 can be produced as follows. View R 4 as the quaternion algebra H . Multiplication of quaternions satisﬁes jabj…jajjbj where jaj denotes the usual Euclidean length of a vector a 2 R 4 . Thus if a and b are unit vectors, so is ab , and hence quaternion multiplication deﬁnes a map S 3 \u0002 S 3!S 3 . This in fact makes S 3 into a group, though associativity is all we need now since associativity implies that any subgroup G of S 3 acts on S 3 by left-multiplication, g—x– … gx . This action is free since an equation x … gx in the division algebra H implies g … 1or x … 0. As a concrete example, G could be the familiar quaternion group Q8 …f\u00061; \u0006i; \u0006j; \u0006kg from group theory. More generally, for a positive integer m , let Q4m be the subgroup of S 3 generated by the two quaternions a … eˇ i=m and b … j . Thus a has order 2m and b has order 4 . The easily veriﬁed relations a m … b2 …−1 and bab−1 … a−1 imply that the subgroup Z2m generated by a is normal and of index 2 in Q4m . Hence Q4m is a group of order 4m , called the generalized quaternion group. Another common name for this group is the binary dihedral group D\u0003 4m since its quotient by the subgroup f\u00061g is the ordinary dihedral group D2m of order 2m . Besides the groups Q4m … D\u0003 4m there are just three other noncyclic ﬁnite sub- groups of S 3 : the binary tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral groups T \u0003 24 , O\u0003 48; and I\u0003 120; of orders indicated by the subscripts. These project two-to-one onto the groups of rotational symmetries of a regular tetrahedron, octahedron (or cube), and icosahedron (or dodecahedron). In fact, it is not hard to see that the homomorphism S 3!SO—3– sending u 2 S 3 ˆ H to the isometry v!u−1vu of R 3 , viewing R 3 as the ‘pure imaginary’ quaternions v … ai ‡ bj ‡ ck , is surjective with kernel f\u00061g . Then the groups D\u0003 4m , T \u0003 24 , O\u0003 48 , I\u0003 120 are the preimages in S 3 of the groups of rotational symmetries of a regular polygon or polyhedron in R3 . There are two conditions that a ﬁnite group G acting freely on S n must satisfy: (a) Every abelian subgroup of G is cyclic. This is equivalent to saying that G contains no subgroup Zp \u0002 Zp with p prime. (b) G contains at most one element of order 2 . A proof of (a) is sketched in an exercise for x4.2. For a proof of (b) the original source [Milnor 1957] is recommended reading. The groups satisfying (a) have been 76 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group completely classiﬁed; see [Brown 1982], section VI.9, for details. An example of a group satisfying (a) but not (b) is the dihedral group D2m for odd m> 1. There is also a much more difﬁcult converse: A ﬁnite group satisfying (a) and (b) acts freely on S n for some n . References for this are [Madsen, Thomas, & Wall 1976] and [Davis & Milgram 1985]. There is also almost complete information about which n ’s are possible for a given group. Example 1.44. In Example 1.35 we constructed a contractible 2 complex eXm;n … Tm;n \u0002 R as the universal cover of a ﬁnite 2 complex Xm;n that was the union of the mapping cylinders of the two maps S 1!S 1 , z , zm and z , zn . The group of deck transformations of this covering space is therefore the fundamental group ˇ1—Xm;n– . From van Kampen’s theorem applied to the decomposition of Xm;n into the two mapping cylinders we have the presentation a; b jjjj amb−n \u000b for this group Gm;n … ˇ1—Xm;n– . It is interesting to look at the action of Gm;n on eXm;n more closely. We described a decomposition of eXm;n into rectangles, with Xm;n the quotient of one rectangle. These rectangles in fact deﬁne a cell structure on eXm;n lifting a cell structure on Xm;n with two vertices, three edges, and one 2 cell. The group Gm;n is thus a group of symmetries of this cell structure on eXm;n . If we orient the three edges of Xm;n and lift these orientations to the edges of eXm;n , then Gm;n is the group of all symmetries of eXm;n preserving the orientations of edges. For example, the element a acts as a ‘screw motion’ about an axis that is a vertical line fvag\u0002 R with va a vertex of Tm;n , and b acts similarly for a vertex vb . Since the action of Gm;n on eXm;n preserves the cell structure, it also preserves the product structure Tm;n \u0002 R . This means that there are actions of Gm;n on Tm;n and R such that the action on the product Xm;n … Tm;n \u0002 R is the diagonal action g—x; y– … ( g—x–; g—y–\u0001 for g 2 Gm;n . If we make the rectangles of unit height in the R coordinate, then the element am … bn acts on R as unit translation, while a acts by 1=m translation and b by 1=n translation. The translation actions of a and b on R generate a group of translations of R that is inﬁnite cyclic, generated by translation by the reciprocal of the least common multiple of m and n . The action of Gm;n on Tm;n has kernel consisting of the powers of the element am … bn . This inﬁnite cyclic subgroup is precisely the center of Gm;n , as we saw in Example 1.24. There is an induced action of the quotient group Zm \u0003 Zn on Tm;n , but this is not a free action since the elements a and b and all their conjugates ﬁx vertices of Tm;n . On the other hand, if we restrict the action of Gm;n on Tm;n to the kernel K of the map Gm;n!Z given by the action of Gm;n on the R factor of Xm;n , then we do obtain a free action of K on Tm;n . Since this action takes vertices to vertices and edges to edges, it is a covering space action, so K is a free group, the fundamental group of the graph Tm;n=K . An exercise at the end of the section is to determine Tm;n=K explicitly and compute the number of generators of K . Covering Spaces Section 1.3 77 Cayley Complexes Covering spaces can be used to describe a very classical method for viewing groups geometrically as graphs. Recall from Corollary 1.28 how we associated to each group presentation G … g\u000b jjjj r\f \u000b a2 dimensional cell complex XG with ˇ1—XG– ˇ G by taking a wedge-sum of circles, one for each generator g\u000b , and then attaching a 2 cell for each relator r\f . We can construct a cell complex eXG with a covering space action of G such that eXG=G … XG in the following way. Let the vertices of eXG be the elements of G themselves. Then, at each vertex g 2 G , insert an edge joining g to gg\u000b for each of the chosen generators g\u000b . The resulting graph is known as the Cayley graph of G with respect to the generators g\u000b . This graph is connected since every element of G is a product of g\u000b ’s, so there is a path in the graph joining each vertex to the identity vertex e . Each relation r\f determines a loop in the graph, starting at any vertex g , and we attach a 2 cell for each such loop. The resulting cell complex eXG is the Cayley complex of G . The group G acts on eXG by multiplication on the left. Thus, an element g 2 G sends a vertex g0 2 G to the vertex gg0 , and the edge from g0 to g0g\u000b is sent to the edge from gg0 to gg0g\u000b . The action extends to 2 cells in the obvious way. This is clearly a covering space action, and the orbit space is just XG . In fact eXG is the universal cover of XG since it is simply-connected. This can be seen by considering the homomorphism ' : ˇ1—XG–!G deﬁned in the proof of Propo- sition 1.39. For an edge e\u000b in XG corresponding to a generator g\u000b of G , it is clear from the deﬁnition of ' that '—ƒe\u000b⁄– … g\u000b ,so ' is an isomorphism. In particular the kernel of ' , p\u0003( ˇ1— eXG–\u0001 , is zero, hence also ˇ1— eXG– since p\u0003 is injective. Let us look at some examples of Cayley complexes. Example 1.45. When G is the free group on two generators a and b , XG is S 1 _ S 1 and eXG is the Cayley graph of Z \u0003 Z pictured at the right. The action of a on this graph is a rightward shift along the central horizontal axis, while b acts by an upward shift along the central vertical axis. The composition e a ab ab baba b a b b b -1 a -1 a -1 a -2 -1 a -1 -1 b -2 -1 b-1 b -1 ab -1 a 2 2 ab of these two shifts then takes the vertex e to the vertex ab . Similarly, the action of any w 2 Z \u0003 Z takes e to the vertex w . Example 1.46. The group G … Z\u0002 Z with presentation x; y jjjj xyx−1y −1 \u000b has XG the torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 , and eXG is R 2 with vertices the integer lattice Z 2 ˆ R2 and edges the horizontal and vertical segments between these lattice points. The action of G is by translations —x; y– , —x ‡ m; y ‡ n– . 78 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group Example 1.47. For G … Z2 … x jjjj x2 \u000b , XG is RP2 and eXG … S 2 . More generally, for Zn … x jjjj xn \u000b , XG is S 1 with a disk attached by the map z , zn and eXG consists of n disks D1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;Dn with their boundary circles identiﬁed. A generator of Zn acts on this union of disks by sending Di to Di‡1 via a 2ˇ=n rotation, the subscript i being taken mod n . The common boundary circle of the disks is rotated by 2ˇ=n . Example 1.48.If G … Z2 \u0003 Z2 … a; b jjjj a2;b2 \u000b then the Cayley graph is a union of an inﬁnite sequence of circles each tangent to its two neighbors. a a a a a a b bb b b bbab ba b e a abaab We obtain eXG from this graph by making each circle the equator of a 2 sphere, yield- ing an inﬁnite sequence of tangent 2 spheres. Elements of the index-two normal subgroup Z ˆ Z2 \u0003 Z2 generated by ab act on eXG as translations by an even number of units, while each of the remaining elements of Z2 \u0003 Z2 acts as the antipodal map on one of the spheres and ﬂips the whole chain of spheres end-for-end about this sphere. The orbit space XG is RP2 _ RP2 . It is not hard to see the generalization of this example to Zm \u0003 Zn with the pre- sentation a; b jjjj am;bn \u000b , so that eXG consists of an inﬁnite union of copies of the Cayley complexes for Zm and Zn constructed in Example 1.47, arranged in a tree-like pattern. The case of Z2 \u0003 Z3 is pictured below. a a a a a a aa a a a ab ab b b b b b b b ba b e 2 2 Covering Spaces Section 1.3 79 Exercises 1. For a covering space p : eX!X and a subspace A ˆ X , let eA … p−1—A– . Show that the restriction p : eA!A is a covering space. 2. Show that if p1 : eX1!X1 and p2 : eX2!X2 are covering spaces, so is their product p1 \u0002 p2 : eX1 \u0002 eX2!X1 \u0002 X2 . 3. Let p : eX!X be a covering space with p−1—x– ﬁnite and nonempty for all x 2 X . Show that eX is compact Hausdorff iff X is compact Hausdorff. 4. Construct a simply-connected covering space of the space X ˆ R 3 that is the union of a sphere and a diameter. Do the same when X is the union of a sphere and a circle intersecting it in two points. 5. Let X be the subspace of R2 consisting of the four sides of the square ƒ0; 1⁄\u0002 ƒ0; 1⁄ together with the segments of the vertical lines x … 1=2; 1=3; 1=4; \u0001\u0001\u0001 inside the square. Show that for every covering space eX!X there is some neighborhood of the left edge of X that lifts homeomorphically to eX . Deduce that X has no simply-connected covering space. 6. Let X be the shrinking wedge of circles in Example 1.25, and let eX be its covering space shown in the ﬁgure below. Construct a two-sheeted covering space Y! eX such that the composition Y! eX!X of the two covering spaces is not a covering space. Note that a composition of two covering spaces does have the unique path lifting property, however. 7. Let Y be the quasi-circle shown in the ﬁgure, a closed subspace of R2 consisting of a portion of the graph of y … sin—1=x– , the segment ƒ−1; 1⁄ in the y axis, and an arc connecting these two pieces. Collapsing the segment of Y in the y axis to a point gives a quotient map f : Y!S 1 . Show that f does not lift to the covering space R!S 1 , even though ˇ1—Y – … 0 . Thus local path-connectedness of Y is a necessary hypothesis in the lifting criterion. 8. Let eX and eY be simply-connected covering spaces of the path-connected, locally path-connected spaces X and Y . Show that if X ' Y then eX ' eY . [Exercise 10 in Chapter 0 may be helpful.] 9.

Construct ﬁnite graphs X1 and X2 having a common ﬁnite-sheeted covering space eX1 … eX2 , but such that there is no space having both X1 and X2 as covering spaces. 12. Let a and b be the generators of ˇ1—S 1 _ S 1– corresponding to the two S 1 summands. Draw a picture of the covering space of S 1 _ S 1 corresponding to the normal subgroup generated by a2 , b2 , and —ab– 4 , and prove that this covering space is indeed the correct one. 13. Determine the covering space of S 1 _ S 1 corresponding to the subgroup of ˇ1—S 1 _ S 1– generated by the cubes of all elements. The covering space is 27 sheeted and can be drawn on a torus so that the complementary regions are nine triangles with edges labeled aaa , nine triangles with edges labeled bbb , and nine hexagons with edges labeled ababab . [For the analogous problem with sixth powers instead of cubes, the resulting covering space would have 228325 sheets! And for k th powers with k sufﬁciently large, the covering space would have inﬁnitely many sheets. The underlying group theory question here, whether the quotient of Z \u0003 Z obtained by factoring out all k th powers is ﬁnite, is known as Burnside’s problem. It can also be asked for a free group on n generators.] 14. Find all the connected covering spaces of RP2 _ RP2 . 15. Let p : eX!X be a simply-connected covering space of X and let A ˆ X be a path-connected, locally path-connected subspace, with eA ˆ eX a path-component of p−1—A– . Show that p : eA!A is the covering space corresponding to the kernel of the map ˇ1—A–!ˇ1—X– . 16. Given maps X!Y!Z such that both Y!Z and the composition X!Z are covering spaces, show that X!Y is a covering space if Z is locally path-connected, and show that this covering space is normal if X!Z is a normal covering space. 17. Given a group G and a normal subgroup N , show that there exists a normal covering space eX!X with ˇ1—X– ˇ G , ˇ1— eX– ˇ N , and deck transformation group G— eX– ˇ G=N . 18. For a path-connected, locally path-connected, and semilocally simply-connected space X , call a path-connected covering space eX!X abelian if it is normal and has abelian deck transformation group. Show that X has an abelian covering space that is a covering space of every other abelian covering space of X , and that such a ‘universal’ abelian covering space is unique up to isomorphism. Describe this covering space explicitly for X … S 1 _ S 1 and X … S 1 _ S 1 _ S 1 . 19. Use the preceding problem to show that a closed orientable surface Mg of genus g has a connected normal covering space with deck transformation group isomorphic to Zn (the product of n copies of Z ) iff n \u0014 2g . For n … 3 and g \u0015 3 , describe such a covering space explicitly as a subspace of R 3 with translations of R 3 as deck trans- formations. Show that such a covering space in R3 exists iff there is an embedding Covering Spaces Section 1.3 81 of Mg in the 3 torus T 3 … S 1 \u0002 S 1 \u0002 S 1 such that the induced map ˇ1—Mg–!ˇ1—T 3– is surjective. 20. Construct nonnormal covering spaces of the Klein bottle by a Klein bottle and by a torus. 21. Let X be the space obtained from a torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 by attaching a M¨obius band via a homeomorphism from the boundary circle of the M¨obius band to the circle S 1 \u0002fx0g in the torus. Compute ˇ1—X– , describe the universal cover of X , and describe the action of ˇ1—X– on the universal cover. Do the same for the space Y obtained by attaching a M¨obius band to RP2 via a homeomorphism from its boundary circle to the circle in RP2 formed by the 1 skeleton of the usual CW structure on RP2 . 22. Given covering space actions of groups G1 on X1 and G2 on X2 , show that the ac- tion of G1 \u0002 G2 on X1 \u0002 X2 deﬁned by —g1;g2–—x1;x2– … —g1—x1–; g2—x2–– is a covering space action, and that —X1 \u0002 X2–=—G1 \u0002 G2– is homeomorphic to X1=G1 \u0002 X2=G2 . 23. Show that if a group G acts freely and properly discontinuously on a Hausdorff space X , then the action is a covering space action. (Here ‘properly discontinuously’ means that each x 2 X has a neighborhood U such that f g 2 G j U \\ g—U– ﬂ ;g is ﬁnite.) In particular, a free action of a ﬁnite group on a Hausdorff space is a covering space action. 24. Given a covering space action of a group G on a path-connected, locally path- connected space X , then each subgroup H ˆ G determines a composition of covering spaces X!X=H!X=G . Show: (a) Every path-connected covering space between X and X=G is isomorphic to X=H for some subgroup H ˆ G . (b) Two such covering spaces X=H1 and X=H2 of X=G are isomorphic iff H1 and H2 are conjugate subgroups of G . (c) The covering space X=H!X=G is normal iff H is a normal subgroup of G ,in which case the group of deck transformations of this cover is G=H . 25. Let ' : R2!R 2 be the linear transformation '—x; y– … —2x; y=2– . This generates an action of Z on X … R 2 −f0g . Show this action is a covering space action and compute ˇ1—X=Z– . Show the orbit space X=Z is non-Hausdorff, and describe how it is a union of four subspaces homeomorphic to S 1 \u0002 R , coming from the complementary components of the x axis and the y axis. 26. For a covering space p : eX!X with X connected, locally path-connected, and semilocally simply-connected, show: (a) The components of eX are in one-to-one correspondence with the orbits of the action of ˇ1—X; x0– on the ﬁber p−1—x0– . (b) Under the Galois correspondence between connected covering spaces of X and subgroups of ˇ1—X; x0– , the subgroup corresponding to the component of eX 82 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group containing a given lift ex0 of x0 is the stabilizer of ex0 , the subgroup consisting of elements whose action on the ﬁber leaves ex0 ﬁxed. 27. For a universal cover p : eX!X we have two actions of ˇ1—X; x0– on the ﬁber p−1—x0– , namely the action given by lifting loops at x0 and the action given by re- stricting deck transformations to the ﬁber. Are these two actions the same when X … S 1 _ S 1 or X … S 1 \u0002 S 1 ? Do the actions always agree when ˇ1—X; x0– is abelian? 28. Generalize the proof of Theorem 1.7 to show that for a covering space action of a group G on a simply-connected space Y , ˇ1—Y =G– is isomorphic to G . [If Y is locally path-connected, this is a special case of part (b) of Proposition 1.40.] 29. Let Y be path-connected, locally path-connected, and simply-connected, and let G1 and G2 be subgroups of Homeo—Y – deﬁning covering space actions on Y . Show that the orbit spaces Y=G1 and Y=G2 are homeomorphic iff G1 and G2 are conjugate subgroups of Homeo—Y – . 30. Draw the Cayley graph of the group Z \u0003 Z2 … a; b jjjj b2 \u000b . 31. Show that the normal covering spaces of S 1 _ S 1 are precisely the graphs that are Cayley graphs of groups with two generators. More generally, the normal cov- ering spaces of the wedge sum of n circles are the Cayley graphs of groups with n generators. 32. Consider covering spaces p : eX!X with eX and X connected CW complexes, the cells of eX projecting homeomorphically onto cells of X . Restricting p to the 1 skeleton then gives a covering space eX1!X1 over the 1 skeleton of X . Show: (a) Two such covering spaces eX1!X and eX2!X are isomorphic iff the restrictions eX1 1!X1 and eX1 2!X1 are isomorphic. (b) eX!X is a normal covering space iff eX1!X1 is normal. (c) The groups of deck transformations of the coverings eX!X and eX1!X1 are isomorphic, via the restriction map. 33. In Example 1.44 let d be the greatest common divisor of m and n , and let m0 … m=d and n 0 … n=d . Show that the graph Tm;n=K consists of m0 vertices labeled a , n0 vertices labeled b , together with d edges joining each a vertex to each b vertex. Deduce that the subgroup K ˆ Gm;n is free on dm0n 0 − m0 − n0 ‡ 1 generators. Graphs and Free Groups Section 1.A 83 Since all groups can be realized as fundamental groups of spaces, this opens the way for using topology to study algebraic properties of groups. The topics in this section and the next give some illustrations of this principle, mainly using covering space theory. We remind the reader that the Additional Topics which form the remainder of this chapter are not to be regarded as an essential part of the basic core of the book. Readers who are eager to move on to new topics should feel free to skip ahead. By deﬁnition, a graph is a 1 dimensional CW complex, in other words, a space X obtained from a discrete set X0 by attaching a collection of 1 cells e\u000b . Thus X is obtained from the disjoint union of X0 with closed intervals I\u000b by identifying the two endpoints of each I\u000b with points of X0 . The points of X0 are the vertices and the 1 cells the edges of X . Note that with this deﬁnition an edge does not include its endpoints, so an edge is an open subset of X . The two endpoints of an edge can be the same vertex, so the closure e\u000b of an edge e\u000b is homeomorphic either to I or S 1 . Since X has the quotient topology from the disjoint union X0 ` \u000b I\u000b , a subset of X is open (or closed) iff it intersects the closure e\u000b of each edge e\u000b in an open (or closed) set in e\u000b . One says that X has the weak topology with respect to the subspaces e\u000b . In this topology a sequence of points in the interiors of distinct edges forms a closed subset, hence never converges. This is true in particular if the edges containing the sequence all have a common vertex and one tries to choose the sequence so that it gets ‘closer and closer’ to the vertex. Thus if there is a vertex that is the endpoint of inﬁnitely many edges, then the weak topology cannot be a metric topology. An exercise at the end of this section is to show the converse, that the weak topology is a metric topology if each vertex is an endpoint of only ﬁnitely many edges. A basis for the topology of X consists of the open intervals in the edges together with the path-connected neighborhoods of the vertices. A neighborhood of the latter sort about a vertex v is the union of connected open neighborhoods U\u000b of v in e\u000b for all e\u000b containing v . In particular, we see that X is locally path-connected. Hence a graph is connected iff it is path-connected. If X has only ﬁnitely many vertices and edges, then X is compact, being the continuous image of the compact space X0 ` \u000b I\u000b . The converse is also true, and more generally, a compact subset C of a graph X can meet only ﬁnitely many vertices and edges of X . To see this, let the subspace D ˆ C consist of the vertices in C together with one point in each edge that C meets. Then D is a closed subset of X since it 84 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group meets each e\u000b in a closed set. For the same reason, any subset of D is closed, so D has the discrete topology. But D is compact, being a closed subset of the compact space C ,so D must be ﬁnite. By the deﬁnition of D this means that C can meet only ﬁnitely many vertices and edges. A subgraph of a graph X is a subspace Y ˆ X that is a union of vertices and edges of X , such that e\u000b ˆ Y implies e\u000b ˆ Y . The latter condition just says that Y is a closed subspace of X .A tree is a contractible graph. By a tree in a graph X we mean a subgraph that is a tree. We call a tree in X maximal if it contains all the vertices of X . This is equivalent to the more obvious meaning of maximality, as we will see below. Proposition 1A.1. Every connected graph contains a maximal tree, and in fact any tree in the graph is contained in a maximal tree. Proof: Let X be a connected graph. We will describe a construction that embeds an arbitrary subgraph X0 ˆ X as a deformation retract of a subgraph Y ˆ X that contains all the vertices of X . By choosing X0 to be any subtree of X , for example a single vertex, this will prove the proposition. As a preliminary step, we construct a sequence of subgraphs X0 ˆ X1 ˆ X2 ˆ\u0001\u0001\u0001 , letting Xi‡1 be obtained from Xi by adjoining the closures e\u000b of all edges e\u000b ˆ X −Xi having at least one endpoint in Xi . The union S i Xi is open in X since a neighborhood of a point in Xi is contained in Xi‡1 . Furthermore, S i Xi is closed since it is a union of closed edges and X has the weak topology. So X … Si Xi since X is connected. Now to construct Y we begin by setting Y0 … X0 . Then inductively, assuming that Yi ˆ Xi has been constructed so as to contain all the vertices of Xi , let Yi‡1 be obtained from Yi by adjoining one edge connecting each vertex of Xi‡1 −Xi to Yi , and let Y … Si Yi . It is evident that Yi‡1 deformation retracts to Yi , and we may obtain a deformation retraction of Y to Y0 … X0 by performing the deformation retraction of Yi‡1 to Yi during the time interval ƒ1=2 i‡1; 1=2 i⁄ . Thus a point x 2 Yi‡1 − Yi is stationary until this interval, when it moves into Yi and thereafter continues mov- ing until it reaches Y0 . The resulting homotopy ht : Y!Y is continuous since it is continuous on the closure of each edge and Y has the weak topology. tu Given a maximal tree T ˆ X and a base vertex x0 2 T , then each edge e\u000b of X − T determines a loop f\u000b in X that goes ﬁrst from x0 to one endpoint of e\u000b by a path in T , then across e\u000b , then back to x0 by a path in T . Strictly speaking, we should ﬁrst orient the edge e\u000b in order to specify which direction to cross it. Note that the homotopy class of f\u000b is independent of the choice of the paths in T since T is simply-connected. Proposition 1A.2. For a connected graph X with maximal tree T , ˇ1—X– is a free group with basis the classes ƒf\u000b⁄ corresponding to the edges e\u000b of X − T . Graphs and Free Groups Section 1.A 85 In particular this implies that a maximal tree is maximal in the sense of not being contained in any larger tree, since adjoining any edge to a maximal tree produces a graph with nontrivial fundamental group. Another consequence is that a graph is a tree iff it is simply-connected. Proof: The quotient map X!X=T is a homotopy equivalence by Proposition 0.17. The quotient X=T is a graph with only one vertex, hence is a wedge sum of circles, whose fundamental group we showed in Example 1.21 to be free with basis the loops given by the edges of X=T , which are the images of the loops f\u000b in X . tu Here is a very useful fact about graphs: Lemma 1A.3. Every covering space of a graph is also a graph, with vertices and edges the lifts of the vertices and edges in the base graph. Proof: Let p : eX!X be the covering space. For the vertices of eX we take the discrete set eX0 … p−1—X0– . Writing X as a quotient space of X0 ` \u000b I\u000b as in the deﬁnition of a graph and applying the path lifting property to the resulting maps I\u000b!X ,we get a unique lift I\u000b! eX passing through each point in p−1—x– , for x 2 e\u000b . These lifts deﬁne the edges of a graph structure on eX . The resulting topology on eX is the same as its original topology since both topologies have the same basic open sets, the covering projection eX!X being a local homeomorphism. tu We can now apply what we have proved about graphs and their fundamental groups to prove a basic fact of group theory: Theorem 1A.4. Every subgroup of a free group is free. Proof: Given a free group F , choose a graph X with ˇ1—X– ˇ F , for example a wedge of circles corresponding to a basis for F . For each subgroup G of F there is by Proposition 1.36 a covering space p : eX!X with p\u0003( ˇ1— eX– \u0001 … G , hence ˇ1— eX– ˇ G since p\u0003 is injective by Proposition 1.31. Since eX is a graph by the preceding lemma, the group G ˇ ˇ1— eX– is free by Proposition 1A.2. tu The structure of trees can be elucidated by looking more closely at the construc- tions in the proof of Proposition 1A.1. If X is a tree and v0 is any vertex of X , then the construction of a maximal tree Y ˆ X starting with Y0 …fv0g yields an increasing sequence of subtrees Yn ˆ X whose union is all of X since a tree has only one maximal subtree, namely itself. We can think of the vertices in Yn − Yn−1 as being at ‘height’ n , with the edges of Yn − Yn−1 connecting these vertices to vertices of height n − 1 . In this way we get a ‘height function’ h : X!R assigning to each vertex its height, and monotone on edges. 86 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group For each vertex v of X there is exactly one edge leading downward from v ,so by following these downward edges we obtain a path from v to the base vertex v0 . This is an example of an edgepath, which is a composition of ﬁnitely many paths each consisting of a single edge traversed monotonically. For any edgepath joining v to v0 other than the downward edgepath, the height function would not be monotone and hence would have local maxima, occurring when the edgepath backtracked, retracing some edge it had just crossed. Thus in a tree there is a unique nonbacktracking edgepath joining any two points. All the vertices and edges along this edgepath are distinct. A tree can contain no subgraph homeomorphic to a circle, since two vertices in such a subgraph could be joined by more than one nonbacktracking edgepath. Conversely, if a connected graph X contains no circle subgraph, then it must be a tree. For if T is a maximal tree in X that is not equal to X , then the union of an edge of X − T with the nonbacktracking edgepath in T joining the endpoints of this edge is a circle subgraph of X . So if there are no circle subgraphs of X , we must have X … T , a tree. For an arbitrary connected graph X and a pair of vertices v0 and v1 in X there is a unique nonbacktracking edgepath in each homotopy class of paths from v0 to v1 . This can be seen by lifting to the universal cover eX , which is a tree since it is simply- connected. Choosing a lift ev0 of v0 , a homotopy class of paths from v0 to v1 lifts to a homotopy class of paths starting at ev0 and ending at a unique lift ev1 of v1 . Then the unique nonbacktracking edgepath in eX from ev0 to ev1 projects to the desired nonbacktracking edgepath in X . Exercises 1. Let X be a graph in which each vertex is an endpoint of only ﬁnitely many edges. Show that the weak topology on X is a metric topology. 2. Show that a connected graph retracts onto any connected subgraph. 3. For a ﬁnite graph X deﬁne the Euler characteristic ˜ —X– to be the number of vertices minus the number of edges. Show that ˜ —X– … 1if X is a tree, and that the rank (number of elements in a basis) of ˇ1—X– is 1 − ˜ —X– if X is connected. 4.If X is a ﬁnite graph and Y is a subgraph homeomorphic to S 1 and containing the basepoint x0 , show that ˇ1—X; x0– has a basis in which one element is represented by the loop Y . 5. Construct a connected graph X and maps f; g : X!X such that fg … 11 but f and g do not induce isomorphisms on ˇ1 . [Note that f\u0003g\u0003 … 11 implies that f\u0003 is surjective and g\u0003 is injective.] 6. Let F be the free group on two generators and let F 0 be its commutator subgroup. Find a set of free generators for F 0 by considering the covering space of the graph S 1 _ S 1 corresponding to F 0 . K(G,1) Spaces and Graphs of Groups Section 1.B 87 7.If F is a ﬁnitely generated free group and N is a nontrivial normal subgroup of inﬁnite index, show, using covering spaces, that N is not ﬁnitely generated. 8. Show that a ﬁnitely generated group has only a ﬁnite number of subgroups of a given ﬁnite index. [First do the case of free groups, using covering spaces of graphs. The general case then follows since every group is a quotient group of a free group.] 9. Using covering spaces, show that an index n subgroup H of a group G has at most n conjugate subgroups gHg−1 in G . Apply this to show that there exists a normal subgroup K ˆ G of ﬁnite index with K ˆ H . [For the latter statement, consider the intersection of all the conjugate subgroups gHg−1 . This is the maximal normal subgroup of G contained in H .] 10. Let X be the wedge sum of n circles, with its natural graph structure, and let eX!X be a covering space with Y ˆ eX a ﬁnite connected subgraph. Show there is a ﬁnite graph Z ˙ Y having the same vertices as Y , such that the projection Y!X extends to a covering space Z!X . 11. Apply the two preceding problems to show that if F is a ﬁnitely generated free group and x 2 F is not the identity element, then there is a normal subgroup H ˆ F of ﬁnite index such that x ˛ H . Hence x has nontrivial image in a ﬁnite quotient group of F . In this situation one says F is residually ﬁnite. 12. Let F be a ﬁnitely generated free group, H ˆ F a ﬁnitely generated subgroup, and x 2 F − H . Show there is a subgroup K of ﬁnite index in F such that K ˙ H and x ˛ K . [Apply Exercise 10.] 13. Let x be a nontrivial element of a ﬁnitely generated free group F . Show there is a ﬁnite-index subgroup H ˆ F in which x is one element of a basis. [Exercises 4 and 10 may be helpful.] 14. Show that the existence of maximal trees is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice. In this section we introduce a class of spaces whose homotopy type depends only on their fundamental group. These spaces arise many places in topology, especially in its interactions with group theory. A path-connected space whose fundamental group is isomorphic to a given group G and which has a contractible universal covering space is called a K(G,1) space. The ‘1’ here refers to ˇ1 . More general K—G; n– spaces are studied in x4.2. All these spaces are called Eilenberg–MacLane spaces, though in the case n … 1 they were studied by 88 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group Hurewicz before Eilenberg and MacLane took up the general case. Here are some examples: Example 1B.1. S 1 is a K—Z; 1– . More generally, a connected graph is a K—G; 1– with G a free group, since by the results of x1.A its universal cover is a tree, hence con- tractible. Example 1B.2. Closed surfaces with inﬁnite ˇ1 , in other words, closed surfaces other than S 2 and RP2 , are K—G; 1– ’s. This will be shown in Example 1B.14 below. It also follows from the theorem in surface theory that the only simply-connected surfaces without boundary are S 2 and R2 , so the universal cover of a closed surface with inﬁnite fundamental group must be R2 since it is noncompact. Nonclosed surfaces deformation retract onto graphs, so such surfaces are K—G; 1– ’s with G free. Example 1B.3. The inﬁnite-dimensional projective space RP1 is a K—Z2; 1– since its universal cover is S 1 , which is contractible. To show the latter fact, a homotopy from the identity map of S 1 to a constant map can be constructed in two stages as follows. First, deﬁne ft : R 1!R 1 by ft—x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– … —1 − t–—x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ‡ t—0;x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . This takes nonzero vectors to nonzero vectors for all t 2 ƒ0; 1⁄ ,so ft=jftj gives a ho- motopy from the identity map of S 1 to the map —x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001–,—0;x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . Then a homotopy from this map to a constant map is given by gt=jgtj where gt—x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– … —1 − t–—0;x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ‡ t—1; 0; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . Example 1B.4. Generalizing the preceding example, we can construct a K—Zm; 1– as an inﬁnite-dimensional lens space S 1=Zm , where Zm acts on S 1 , regarded as the unit sphere in C1 , by scalar multiplication by m th roots of unity, a generator of this action being the map —z1;z2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– , e2ˇ i=m—z1;z2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . It is not hard to check that this is a covering space action. Example 1B.5. A product K—G; 1–\u0002 K—H; 1– is a K—G\u0002 H; 1– since its universal cover is the product of the universal covers of K—G; 1– and K—H; 1– . By taking products of circles and inﬁnite-dimensional lens spaces we therefore get K—G; 1– ’s for arbitrary ﬁnitely generated abelian groups G . For example the n dimensional torus T n , the product of n circles, is a K—Zn; 1– . Example 1B.6. For a closed connected subspace K of S 3 that is nonempty, the com- plement S 3 −K is a K—G; 1– . This is a theorem in 3 manifold theory, but in the special case that K is a torus knot the result follows from our study of torus knot comple- ments in Examples 1.24 and 1.35. Namely, we showed that for K the torus knot Km;n there is a deformation retraction of S 3 − K onto a certain 2 dimensional complex Xm;n having contractible universal cover. The homotopy lifting property then implies that the universal cover of S 3 − K is homotopy equivalent to the universal cover of Xm;n , hence is also contractible. K(G,1) Spaces and Graphs of Groups Section 1.B 89 Example 1B.7. It is not hard to construct a K—G; 1– for an arbitrary group G , us- ing the notion of a Ñ complex deﬁned in x2.1. Let EG be the Ñ complex whose n simplices are the ordered —n ‡ 1– tuples ƒg0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;gn⁄ of elements of G . Such an n simplex attaches to the —n − 1– simplices ƒg0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bgi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;gn⁄ in the obvious way, just as a standard simplex attaches to its faces. (The notation bgi means that this vertex is deleted.) The complex EG is contractible by the homotopy ht that slides each point x 2 ƒg0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;gn⁄ along the line segment in ƒe; g0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;gn⁄ from x to the vertex ƒe⁄ , where e is the identity element of G . This is well-deﬁned in EG since when we restrict to a face ƒg0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bgi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;gn⁄ we have the linear deformation to ƒe⁄ in ƒe; g0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bgi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;gn⁄ . Note that ht carries ƒe⁄ around the loop ƒe; e⁄ ,so ht is not actually a deformation retraction of EG onto ƒe⁄ . The group G acts on EG by left multiplication, an element g 2 G taking the simplex ƒg0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;gn⁄ linearly onto the simplex ƒgg0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;ggn⁄ . Only the identity e takes any simplex to itself, so by an exercise at the end of this section, the action of G on EG is a covering space action. Hence the quotient map EG!EG=G is the universal cover of the orbit space BG … EG=G , and BG is a K—G; 1– . Since G acts on EG by freely permuting simplices, BG inherits a Ñ complex structure from EG . The action of G on EG identiﬁes all the vertices of EG ,so BG has just one vertex. To describe the Ñ complex structure on BG explicitly, note ﬁrst that every n simplex of EG can be written uniquely in the form ƒg0;g0g1;g0g1g2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;g0g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gn⁄ … g0ƒe; g1;g1g2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;g1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 gn⁄ The image of this simplex in BG may be denoted unambiguously by the symbol ƒg1jg2j\u0001\u0001\u0001 jgn⁄ . In this ‘bar’ notation the gi ’s and their ordered products can be used to label edges, viewing an edge label as the ratio between the two labels on the vertices at the endpoints of the edge, as indicated in the ﬁgure. With g g g 0 g 0 g3g3 g 0 1 g 1 g1 g 0g1 g 0g 12 gg 0g 12gg 0g 12 g3g2 g3gg 12 gg 12 g2 g2 gg 12 this notation, the boundary of a simplex ƒg1j\u0001\u0001\u0001 jgn⁄ of BG consists of the simplices ƒg2j \u0001\u0001\u0001 jgn⁄ , ƒg1j\u0001\u0001\u0001 jgn−1⁄ , and ƒg1j\u0001\u0001\u0001 jgigi‡1j\u0001\u0001\u0001 jgn⁄ for i … 1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;n − 1. This construction of a K—G; 1– produces a rather large space, since BG is al- ways inﬁnite-dimensional, and if G is inﬁnite, BG has an inﬁnite number of cells in each positive dimension. For example, BZ is much bigger than S 1 , the most efﬁcient K—Z; 1– . On the other hand, BG has the virtue of being functorial: A homomorphism f : G!H induces a map Bf : BG!BH sending a simplex ƒg1j\u0001\u0001\u0001 jgn⁄ to the simplex ƒf —g1–j\u0001\u0001\u0001 jf—gn–⁄ . A different construction of a K—G; 1– is given in x4.2. Here one starts with any 2 dimensional complex having fundamental group G , for example 90 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group the complex XG associated to a presentation of G , and then one attaches cells of di- mension 3 and higher to make the universal cover contractible without affecting ˇ1 . In general, it is hard to get any control on the number of higher-dimensional cells needed in this construction, so it too can be rather inefﬁcient. Indeed, ﬁnding an efﬁcient K—G; 1– for a given group G is often a difﬁcult problem. It is a curious and almost paradoxical fact that if G contains any elements of ﬁnite order, then every K—G; 1– CW complex must be inﬁnite-dimensional. This is shown in Proposition 2.45. In particular the inﬁnite-dimensional lens space K—Zm; 1– ’s in Example 1B.4 cannot be replaced by any ﬁnite-dimensional complex. In spite of the great latitude possible in the construction of K—G; 1– ’s, there is a very nice homotopical uniqueness property that accounts for much of the interest in K—G; 1– ’s: Theorem 1B.8. The homotopy type of a CW complex K—G; 1– is uniquely determined by G . Having a unique homotopy type of K—G; 1– ’s associated to each group G means that algebraic invariants of spaces that depend only on homotopy type, such as ho- mology and cohomology groups, become invariants of groups. This has proved to be a quite fruitful idea, and has been much studied both from the algebraic and topological viewpoints. The discussion following Proposition 2.45 gives a few references. The preceding theorem will follow easily from: Proposition 1B.9. Let X be a connected CW complex and let Y be a K—G; 1– . Then every homomorphism ˇ1—X; x0–!ˇ1—Y ; y0– is induced by a map —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– that is unique up to homotopy ﬁxing x0 . To deduce the theorem from this, let X and Y be CW complex K—G; 1– ’s with iso- morphic fundamental groups. The proposition gives maps f : —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– and g : —Y ; y0–!—X; x0– inducing inverse isomorphisms ˇ1—X; x0– ˇ ˇ1—Y ; y0– . Then fg and gf induce the identity on ˇ1 and hence are homotopic to the identity maps. Proof of 1B.9: Let us ﬁrst consider the case that X has a single 0 cell, the base- point x0 . Given a homomorphism ' : ˇ1—X; x0–!ˇ1—Y ; y0– , we begin the construc- tion of a map f : —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– with f\u0003 … ' by setting f—x0– … y0 . Each 1 cell e1 \u000b of X has closure a circle determining an element ƒe1 \u000b⁄ 2 ˇ1—X; x0– , and we let f on the closure of e1 \u000b X¼1 1 0()x ' ¤ , X¼1 0()x, Y¼1 0()y, f ¤i ¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!be a map representing '—ƒe1 \u000b⁄– .If i : X1 > X denotes the inclusion, then 'i\u0003 … f\u0003 since ˇ1—X1;x0– is gen- erated by the elements ƒe1 \u000b⁄ . To extend f over a cell e2 \f with attaching map \f : S 1!X1 , all we need is for the composition f \f to be nullhomotopic. Choosing a basepoint s0 2 S 1 and a path in X1 from \f—s0– to x0 , \f determines an element ƒ \f⁄ 2 ˇ1—X1;x0– , and the existence K(G,1) Spaces and Graphs of Groups Section 1.B 91 of a nullhomotopy of f \f is equivalent to f\u0003—ƒ \f⁄– being zero in ˇ1—Y ; y0– .We have i\u0003—ƒ \f⁄– … 0 since the cell e2 \f provides a nullhomotopy of \f in X . Hence f\u0003—ƒ \f⁄– … 'i\u0003—ƒ \f⁄– … 0 , and so f can be extended over e2 \f . Extending f inductively over cells en γ with n> 2 is possible since the attaching maps γ : S n−1!Xn−1 have nullhomotopic compositions f γ : S n−1!Y . This is because f γ lifts to the universal cover of Y if n> 2 , and this cover is contractible by hypothesis, so the lift of f γ is nullhomotopic, hence also f γ itself. Turning to the uniqueness statement, if two maps f0;f1 : —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– in- duce the same homomorphism on ˇ1 , then we see immediately that their restrictions to X1 are homotopic, ﬁxing x0 . To extend the resulting map X1 \u0002 I [ X \u0002 @I!Y over the remaining cells en \u0002 —0; 1– of X \u0002 I we can proceed just as in the preceding paragraph since these cells have dimension n ‡ 1 > 2 . Thus we obtain a homotopy ft : —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– , ﬁnishing the proof in the case that X has a single 0 cell. The case that X has more than one 0 cell can be treated by a small elaboration on this argument. Choose a maximal tree T ˆ X . To construct a map f realizing a given ' , begin by setting f—T – … y0 . Then each edge e1 \u000b in X − T determines an element ƒe1 \u000b⁄ 2 ˇ1—X; x0– , and we let f on the closure of e1 \u000b be a map representing '—ƒe1 \u000b⁄– . Extending f over higher-dimensional cells then proceeds just as before. Constructing a homotopy ft joining two given maps f0 and f1 with f0\u0003 … f1\u0003 also has an extra step. Let ht : X1!X1 be a homotopy starting with h0 … 11 and restricting to a deformation retraction of T onto x0 . (It is easy to extend such a deformation retraction to a homotopy deﬁned on all of X1 .) We can construct a homotopy from f0jX1 to f1jX1 by ﬁrst deforming f0jX1 and f1jX1 to take T to y0 by composing with ht , then applying the earlier argument to obtain a homotopy between the modiﬁed f0jX1 and f1jX1 . Having a homotopy f0jX1 ' f1jX1 we extend this over all of X in the same way as before. tu The ﬁrst part of the preceding proof also works for the 2 dimensional complexes XG associated to presentations of groups. Thus every homomorphism G!H is re- alized as the induced homomorphism of some map XG!XH . However, there is no uniqueness statement for this map, and it can easily happen that different presenta- tions of a group G give XG ’s that are not homotopy equivalent. Graphs of Groups As an illustration of how K—G; 1– spaces can be useful in group theory, we shall describe a procedure for assembling a collection of K—G; 1– ’s together into a K—G; 1– for a larger group G . Group-theoretically, this gives a method for assembling smaller groups together to form a larger group, generalizing the notion of free products. Let Ð be a graph that is connected and oriented, that is, its edges are viewed as arrows, each edge having a speciﬁed direction. Suppose that at each vertex v of Ð we 92 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group place a group Gv and along each edge e of Ð we put a homomorphism 'e from the group at the tail of the edge to the group at the head of the edge. We call this data a graph of groups. Now build a space BÐ by putting the space BGv from Example 1B.7 at each vertex v of Ð and then ﬁlling in a mapping cylinder of the map B'e along each edge e of Ð , identifying the two ends of the mapping cylinder with the two BGv ’s at the ends of e . The resulting space BÐ is then a CW complex since the maps B'e take n cells homeomorphically onto n cells. In fact, the cell structure on BÐ can be canonically subdivided into a Ñ complex structure using the prism construction from the proof of Theorem 2.10, but we will not need to do this here. More generally, instead of BGv one could take any CW complex K—Gv ; 1– at the vertex v , and then along edges put mapping cylinders of maps realizing the homo- morphisms 'e . We leave it for the reader to check that the resulting space K Ð is homotopy equivalent to the BÐ constructed above. Example 1B.10. Suppose Ð consists of one central vertex with a number of edges radiating out from it, and the group Gv at this central vertex is trivial, hence also all the edge homomorphisms. Then van Kampen’s theorem implies that ˇ1—K Ð – is the free product of the groups at all the outer vertices. In view of this example, we shall call ˇ1—K Ð – for a general graph of groups Ð the graph product of the vertex groups Gv with respect to the edge homomorphisms 'e . The name for ˇ1—K Ð – that is generally used in the literature is the rather awkward phrase, ‘the fundamental group of the graph of groups.’ Here is the main result we shall prove about graphs of groups: Theorem 1B.11. If all the edge homomorphisms 'e are injective, then K Ð is a K—G; 1– and the inclusions K—Gv ; 1– > K Ð induce injective maps on ˇ1 . Before giving the proof, let us look at some interesting special cases: Example 1B.12: Free Products with Amalgamation. Suppose the graph of groups is A C!B , with the two maps monomorphisms. One can regard this data as speci- fying embeddings of C as subgroups of A and B . Applying van Kampen’s theorem to the decomposition of K Ð into its two mapping cylinders, we see that ˇ1—K Ð – is the quotient of A \u0003 B obtained by identifying the subgroup C ˆ A with the subgroup C ˆ B . The standard notation for this group is A \u0003C B , the free product of A and B amalgamated along the subgroup C . According to the theorem, A \u0003C B contains both A and B as subgroups. For example, a free product with amalgamation Z \u0003Z Z can be realized by map- ping cylinders of the maps S 1 S 1!S 1 that are m sheeted and n sheeted covering spaces, respectively. We studied this case in Examples 1.24 and 1.35 where we showed that the complex K Ð is a deformation retract of the complement of a torus knot in S 3 if m and n are relatively prime. It is a basic result in 3 manifold theory that the K(G,1) Spaces and Graphs of Groups Section 1.B 93 complement of every smooth knot in S 3 can be built up by iterated graph of groups constructions with injective edge homomorphisms, starting with free groups, so the theorem implies that these knot complements are K—G; 1– ’s. Their universal covers are all R3 , in fact. Example 1B.13: HNN Extensions. Consider a graph of groups CA Ã ' with ' and both monomorphisms. This is analogous to the previous case A C!B , but with the two groups A and B coalesced to a single group. The group ˇ1—K Ð – , which was denoted A \u0003C B in the previous case, is now denoted A\u0003C . To see what this group looks like, let us regard K Ð as being obtained from K—A; 1– by attaching K—C; 1–\u0002 I along the two ends K—C; 1–\u0002 @I via maps realizing the monomorphisms ' and . Using a K—C; 1– with a single 0 cell, we see that K Ð can be obtained from K—A; 1– _ S 1 by attaching cells of dimension two and greater, so ˇ1—K Ð – is a quotient of A \u0003 Z , and it is not hard to ﬁgure out that the relations deﬁning this quotient are of the form t'—c–t−1 … —c– where t is a generator of the Z factor and c ranges over C , or a set of generators for C . We leave the veriﬁcation of this for the Exercises. As a very special case, taking ' … … 11 gives A\u0003A … A\u0002 Z since we can take K Ð … K—A; 1–\u0002 S 1 in this case. More generally, taking ' … 11 with an arbitrary automorphism of A , we realize any semidirect product of A and Z as A\u0003A . For example, the Klein bottle occurs this way, with ' realized by the identity map of S 1 and by a reﬂection. In these cases when ' … 11 we could realize the same group ˇ1—K Ð – using a slightly simpler graph of groups, with a single vertex, labeled A , and a single edge, labeled . Here is another special case. Suppose we take a torus, delete a small open disk, then identify the resulting boundary circle with a longitudinal circle of the torus. This produces a space X that happens to be homeomorphic to a subspace of the stan- dard picture of a Klein bottle in R 3 ; see Exercise 12 of x1.2. The fundamental group ˇ1—X– has the form —Z \u0003 Z– \u0003Z Z with the deﬁning relation tb\u00061t−1 … aba −1b−1 where a is a meridional loop and b is a longitudinal loop on the torus. The sign of the exponent in the term b\u00061 is immaterial since the two ways of glueing the boundary circle to the longitude produce homeomorphic spaces. The group ˇ1—X– … a; b; t jjjj tbt−1aba −1b−1 \u000b abelianizes to Z\u0002 Z , but to show that ˇ1—X– is not iso- morphic to Z \u0003 Z takes some work. There is a surjection ˇ1—X–!Z \u0003 Z obtained by setting b … 1 . This has nontrivial kernel since b is nontrivial in ˇ1—X– by the pre- ceding theorem. If ˇ1—X– were isomorphic to Z \u0003 Z we would then have a surjective homomorphism Z \u0003 Z!Z \u0003 Z that was not an isomorphism. However, it is a theorem in group theory that a free group F is hopﬁan — every surjective homomorphism F!F must be injective. Hence ˇ1—X– is not free. Example 1B.14: Closed Surfaces. A closed orientable surface M of genus two or greater can be cut along a circle into two compact surfaces M1 and M2 such that the 94 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group closed surfaces obtained from M1 and M2 by ﬁlling in their boundary circle with a disk have smaller genus than M . Each of M1 and M2 is the mapping cylinder of a map from S 1 to a ﬁnite graph. Namely, view Mi as obtained from a closed surface by deleting an open disk in the interior of the 2 cell in the standard CW structure described in Chapter 0, so that Mi becomes the mapping cylinder of the attaching map of the 2 cell. This attaching map is not nullhomotopic, so it induces an injection on ˇ1 since free groups are torsionfree. Thus we have realized the original surface M as K Ð for Ð a graph of groups of the form F1 ------ Z -! F2 with F1 and F2 free and the two maps injective. The theorem then says that M is a K—G; 1– . A similar argument works for closed nonorientable surfaces other than RP2 . For example, the Klein bottle is obtained from two M¨obius bands by identifying their boundary circles, and a M¨obius band is the mapping cylinder of the 2 sheeted covering space S 1!S 1 . Proof of 1B.11: We shall construct a covering space eK!K Ð by gluing together copies of the universal covering spaces of the various mapping cylinders in K Ð in such a way that eK will be contractible. Hence eK will be the universal cover of K Ð , which will therefore be a K—G; 1– . First a preliminary observation: Given a universal covering space p : eX!X and a connected, locally path-connected subspace A ˆ X such that the inclusion A> X in- duces an injection on ˇ1 , then each component eA of p−1—A– is a universal cover of A . To see this, note that p : eA!A is a covering space, so the induced map ˇ1— eA–!ˇ1—A– is injective, and this map factors through ˇ1— eX– … 0 , hence ˇ1— eA– … 0 . For exam- ple, if X is the torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 and A is the circle S 1 \u0002fx0g , then p−1—A– consists of inﬁnitely many parallel lines in R2 , each of which is a universal cover of A . For a map f : A!B between connected CW complexes, let p : fMf !Mf be the universal cover of the mapping cylinder Mf . Then fMf is itself the mapping cylinder of a map ef : p−1—A–!p−1—B– since the line segments in the mapping cylinder struc- ture on Mf lift to line segments in fMf deﬁning a mapping cylinder structure. Since fMf is a mapping cylinder, it deformation retracts onto p−1—B– ,so p−1—B– is also simply-connected, hence is the universal cover of B .If f induces an injection on ˇ1 , then the remarks in the preceding paragraph apply, and the components of p−1—A– are universal covers of A . If we assume further that A and B are K—G; 1– ’s, then fMf and the components of p−1—A– are contractible, and we claim that fMf deformation retracts onto each component eA of A . Namely, the inclusion eA > fMf is a homo- topy equivalence since both spaces are contractible, and then Corollary 0.20 implies that fMf deformation retracts onto eA since the pair —fMf ; eA– satisﬁes the homotopy extension property, as shown in Example 0.15. Now we can describe the construction of the covering space eK of K Ð . It will be the union of an increasing sequence of spaces eK1 ˆ eK2 ˆ\u0001\u0001\u0001 . For the ﬁrst stage, let eK1 be the universal cover of one of the mapping cylinders Mf of K Ð . By the K(G,1) Spaces and Graphs of Groups Section 1.B 95 preceding remarks, this contains various disjoint copies of universal covers of the two K—Gv ; 1– ’s at the ends of Mf . We build eK2 from eK1 by attaching to each of these universal covers of K—Gv ; 1– ’s a copy of the universal cover of each mapping cylinder Mg of K Ð meeting Mf at the end of Mf in question. Now repeat the process to construct eK3 by attaching universal covers of mapping cylinders at all the universal covers of K—Gv ; 1– ’s created in the previous step. In the same way, we construct eKn‡1 from eKn for all n , and then we set eK … S n eKn . Note that eKn‡1 deformation retracts onto eKn since it is formed by attaching pieces to eKn that deformation retract onto the subspaces along which they attach, by our earlier remarks. It follows that eK is contractible since we can deformation retract eKn‡1 onto eKn during the time interval ƒ1=2 n‡1; 1=2 n⁄ , and then ﬁnish with a contraction of eK1 to a point during the time interval ƒ1=2; 1⁄. The natural projection eK!K Ð is clearly a covering space, so this ﬁnishes the proof that K Ð is a K—G; 1– . The remaining statement that each inclusion K—Gv ; 1–> K Ð induces an injection on ˇ1 can easily be deduced from the preceding constructions. For suppose a loop γ : S 1!K—Gv ; 1– is nullhomotopic in K Ð . By the lifting criterion for covering spaces, there is a lift eγ : S 1! eK . This has image contained in one of the copies of the universal cover of K—Gv ; 1– ,so eγ is nullhomotopic in this universal cover, and hence γ is nullhomotopic in K—Gv ; 1– . tu The various mapping cylinders that make up the universal cover of K Ð are ar- ranged in a treelike pattern. The tree in question, call it T Ð , has one vertex for each copy of a universal cover of a K—Gv ; 1– in eK , and two vertices are joined by an edge whenever the two universal covers of K—Gv ; 1– ’s corresponding to these vertices are connected by a line segment lifting a line segment in the mapping cylinder structure of a mapping cylinder of K Ð . The inductive construction of eK is reﬂected in an inductive construction of T Ð as a union of an increasing sequence of subtrees T1 ˆ T2 ˆ\u0001\u0001\u0001 . Corresponding to eK1 is a subtree T1 ˆ T Ð consisting of a central vertex with a number of edges radiating out from it, an ‘asterisk’ with possibly an inﬁnite number of edges. When we enlarge eK1 to eK2 , T1 is correspondingly enlarged to a tree T2 by attaching a similar asterisk at the end of each outer vertex of T1 , and each subsequent enlarge- ment is handled in the same way. The action of ˇ1—K Ð – on eK as deck transformations induces an action on T Ð , permuting its vertices and edges, and the orbit space of T Ð under this action is just the original graph Ð . The action on T Ð will not generally be a free action since the elements of a subgroup Gv ˆ ˇ1—K Ð – ﬁx the vertex of T Ð corresponding to one of the universal covers of K—Gv ; 1– . There is in fact an exact correspondence between graphs of groups and groups acting on trees. See [Scott & Wall 1979] for an exposition of this rather nice theory. From the viewpoint of groups acting on trees, the deﬁnition of a graph of groups is 96 Chapter 1 The Fundamental Group usually taken to be slightly more restrictive than the one we have given here, namely, one considers only oriented graphs obtained from an unoriented graph by subdividing each edge by adding a vertex at its midpoint, then orienting the two resulting edges outward, away from the new vertex. Exercises 1. Suppose a group G acts simplicially on a Ñ complex X , where ‘simplicially’ means that each element of G takes each simplex of X onto another simplex by a linear homeomorphism. If the action is free, show it is a covering space action. 2. Let X be a connected CW complex and G a group such that every homomorphism ˇ1—X–!G is trivial. Show that every map X!K—G; 1– is nullhomotopic. 3. Show that every graph product of trivial groups is free. 4. Use van Kampen’s theorem to compute A\u0003C as a quotient of A \u0003 Z , as stated in the text. 5. Consider the graph of groups Ð having one vertex, Z , and one edge, the map Z!Z that is multiplication by 2, realized by the 2 sheeted covering space S 1!S 1 . Show that ˇ1—K Ð – has presentation a; b jjjj bab−1a−2 \u000b and describe the universal cover of K Ð explicitly as a product T \u0002 R with T a tree. [The group ˇ1—K Ð – is the ﬁrst in a family of groups called Baumslag-Solitar groups, having presentations of the form a; b jjjj bamb−1a −n \u000b . These are HNN extensions Z\u0003Z .] 6. Show that for a graph of groups all of whose edge homomorphisms are injective maps Z!Z , we can choose K Ð to have universal cover a product T \u0002 R with T a tree. Work out in detail the case that the graph of groups is the inﬁnite sequence Z 2-----! Z 3-----! Z 4-----! Z -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 where the map Z n-----! Z is multiplication by n . Show that ˇ1—K Ð – is isomorphic to Q in this case. How would one modify this example to get ˇ1—K Ð – isomorphic to the subgroup of Q consisting of rational numbers with denominator a power of 2 ? 7. Show that every graph product of groups can be realized by a graph whose vertices are partitioned into two subsets, with every oriented edge going from a vertex in the ﬁrst subset to a vertex in the second subset. 8. Show that a ﬁnite graph product of ﬁnitely generated groups is ﬁnitely generated, and similarly for ﬁnitely presented groups. 9. Show that a ﬁnite graph product of ﬁnite groups has a free subgroup of ﬁnite index, by constructing a ﬁnite-sheeted covering space of K Ð from universal covers of the mapping cylinders of K Ð . [The converse is also true for ﬁnitely generated groups; see [Scott & Wall 1979] for more on this.] The fundamental group ˇ1—X– is especially useful when studying spaces of low dimension, as one would expect from its deﬁnition which involves only maps from low-dimensional spaces into X , namely loops I!X and homotopies of loops, maps I \u0002 I!X . The deﬁnition in terms of objects that are at most 2 dimensional manifests itself for example in the fact that when X is a CW complex, ˇ1—X– depends only on the 2 skeleton of X . In view of the low-dimensional nature of the fundamental group, we should not expect it to be a very reﬁned tool for dealing with high-dimensional spaces. Thus it cannot distinguish between spheres S n with n \u0015 2 . This limitation to low dimensions can be removed by considering the natural higher-dimensional analogs of ˇ1—X– , the homotopy groups ˇn—X– , which are deﬁned in terms of maps of the n dimensional cube In into X and homotopies In \u0002 I!X of such maps. Not surprisingly, when X is a CW complex, ˇn—X– depends only on the —n ‡ 1– skeleton of X . And as one might hope, homotopy groups do indeed distinguish spheres of all dimensions since ˇi—S n– is 0 for i<n and Z for i … n . However, the higher-dimensional homotopy groups have the serious drawback that they are extremely difﬁcult to compute in general. Even for simple spaces like spheres, the calculation of ˇi—S n– for i>n turns out to be a huge problem. For- tunately there is a more computable alternative to homotopy groups: the homology groups Hn—X– . Like ˇn—X– , the homology group Hn—X– for a CW complex X de- pends only on the —n ‡ 1– skeleton. For spheres, the homology groups Hi—S n– are isomorphic to the homotopy groups ˇi—S n– in the range 1 \u0014 i \u0014 n , but homology groups have the advantage that Hi—S n– … 0 for i>n . The computability of homology groups does not come for free, unfortunately. The deﬁnition of homology groups is decidedly less transparent than the deﬁnition of homotopy groups, and once one gets beyond the deﬁnition there is a certain amount of technical machinery to be set up before any real calculations and applications can be given. In the exposition below we approach the deﬁnition of Hn—X– by two prelim- inary stages, ﬁrst giving a few motivating examples nonrigorously, then constructing 98 Chapter 2 Homology a restricted model of homology theory called simplicial homology, before plunging into the general theory, known as singular homology. After the deﬁnition of singular homology has been assimilated, the real work of establishing its basic properties be- gins. This takes close to 20 pages, and there is no getting around the fact that it is a substantial effort. This takes up most of the ﬁrst section of the chapter, with small digressions only for two applications to classical theorems of Brouwer: the ﬁxed point theorem and ‘invariance of dimension.’ The second section of the chapter gives more applications, including the ho- mology deﬁnition of Euler characteristic and Brouwer’s notion of degree for maps S n!S n . However, the main thrust of this section is toward developing techniques for calculating homology groups efﬁciently. The maximally efﬁcient method is known as cellular homology, whose power comes perhaps from the fact that it is ‘homology squared’ — homology deﬁned in terms of homology. Another quite useful tool is Mayer–Vietoris sequences, the analog for homology of van Kampen’s theorem for the fundamental group. An interesting feature of homology that begins to emerge after one has worked with it for a while is that it is the basic properties of homology that are used most often, and not the actual deﬁnition itself. This suggests that an axiomatic approach to homology might be possible. This is indeed the case, and in the third section of the chapter we list axioms which completely characterize homology groups for CW complexes. One could take the viewpoint that these rather algebraic axioms are all that really matters about homology groups, that the geometry involved in the deﬁnition of homology is secondary, needed only to show that the axiomatic theory is not vacuous. The extent to which one adopts this viewpoint is a matter of taste, and the route taken here of postponing the axioms until the theory is well-established is just one of several possible approaches. The chapter then concludes with three optional sections of Additional Topics. The ﬁrst is rather brief, relating H1—X– to ˇ1—X– , while the other two contain a selection of classical applications of homology. These include the n dimensional version of the Jordan curve theorem and the ‘invariance of domain’ theorem, both due to Brouwer, along with the Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem. The Idea of Homology The difﬁculty with the higher homotopy groups ˇn is that they are not directly computable from a cell structure as ˇ1 is. For example, the 2-sphere has no cells in dimensions greater than 2, yet its n dimensional homotopy group ˇn—S 2– is nonzero for inﬁnitely many values of n . Homology groups, by contrast, are quite directly related to cell structures, and may indeed be regarded as simply an algebraization of the ﬁrst layer of geometry in cell structures: how cells of dimension n attach to cells of dimension n − 1. The Idea of Homology 99 Let us look at some examples to see what the idea is. Consider the graph X1 shown in the ﬁgure, consisting of two vertices joined by four edges. When studying the fundamental group of X1 we consider da x y cb loops formed by sequences of edges, starting and ending at a ﬁxed basepoint. For example, at the basepoint x , the loop ab−1 travels forward along the edge a , then backward along b , as indicated by the exponent −1 . A more compli- cated loop would be ac−1bd −1ca −1 . A salient feature of the fundamental group is that it is generally nonabelian, which both enriches and compli- cates the theory. Suppose we simplify matters by abelianizing. Thus for example the two loops ab−1 and b−1a are to be regarded as equal if we make a commute with b−1 . These two loops ab−1 and b−1a are really the same circle, just with a different choice of starting and ending point: x for ab−1 and y for b−1a . The same thing happens for all loops: Rechoosing the basepoint in a loop just permutes its letters cyclically, so a byproduct of abelianizing is that we no longer have to pin all our loops down to a ﬁxed basepoint. Thus loops become cycles, without a chosen basepoint. Having abelianized, let us switch to additive notation, so cycles become linear combinations of edges with integer coefﬁcients, such as a − b ‡ c − d . Let us call these linear combinations chains of edges. Some chains can be decomposed into cycles in several different ways, for example —a − c– ‡ —b − d– … —a − d– ‡ —b − c– , and if we adopt an algebraic viewpoint then we do not want to distinguish between these different decompositions. Thus we broaden the meaning of the term ‘cycle’ to be simply any linear combination of edges for which at least one decomposition into cycles in the previous more geometric sense exists. What is the condition for a chain to be a cycle in this more algebraic sense? A geometric cycle, thought of as a path traversed in time, is distinguished by the prop- erty that it enters each vertex the same number of times that it leaves the vertex. For an arbitrary chain ka ‡ `b ‡ mc ‡ nd , the net number of times this chain enters y is k ‡ ` ‡ m ‡ n since each of a , b , c , and d enters y once. Similarly, each of the four edges leaves x once, so the net number of times the chain ka ‡ `b ‡ mc ‡ nd enters x is −k − ` − m − n . Thus the condition for ka ‡ `b ‡ mc ‡ nd to be a cycle is simply k ‡ ` ‡ m ‡ n … 0. To describe this result in a way that would generalize to all graphs, let C1 be the free abelian group with basis the edges a; b; c; d and let C0 be the free abelian group with basis the vertices x; y . Elements of C1 are chains of edges, or 1 dimensional chains, and elements of C0 are linear combinations of vertices, or 0 dimensional chains. Deﬁne a homomorphism @ : C1!C0 by sending each basis element a; b; c; d to y − x , the vertex at the head of the edge minus the vertex at the tail. Thus we have @—ka ‡ `b ‡ mc ‡ nd– … —k ‡ ` ‡ m ‡ n–y − —k ‡ ` ‡ m ‡ n–x , and the cycles are precisely the kernel of @ . It is a simple calculation to verify that a−b , b −c , and c −d 100 Chapter 2 Homology form a basis for this kernel. Thus every cycle in X1 is a unique linear combination of these three most obvious cycles. By means of these three basic cycles we convey the geometric information that the graph X1 has three visible ‘holes,’ the empty spaces between the four edges. Let us now enlarge the preceding graph X1 by attaching a 2 cell A along the cycle a − b , producing a 2 dimensional cell complex X2 .If x y dca bA we think of the 2 cell A as being oriented clockwise, then we can regard its boundary as the cycle a − b . This cycle is now homotopically trivial since we can contract it to a point by sliding over A . In other words, it no longer encloses a hole in X2 . This suggests that we form a quotient of the group of cycles in the preceding example by factoring out the subgroup generated by a − b . In this quotient the cycles a − c and b − c , for example, become equivalent, consistent with the fact that they are homotopic in X2 . Algebraically, we can deﬁne now a pair of homomorphisms C2 @2------------! C1 @1------------! C0 where C2 is the inﬁnite cyclic group generated by A and @2—A– … a − b . The map @1 is the boundary homomorphism in the previous example. The quotient group we are interested in is Ker @1= Im @2 , the 1 dimensional cycles modulo those that are boundaries, the multiples of a−b . This quotient group is the homology group H1—X2– . The previous example can be ﬁt into this scheme too by taking C2 to be zero since there are no 2 cells in X1 , so in this case H1—X1– … Ker @1= Im @2 … Ker @1 , which as we saw was free abelian on three generators. In the present example, H1—X2– is free abelian on two generators, b − c and c − d , expressing the geometric fact that by ﬁlling in the 2 cell A we have reduced the number of ‘holes’ in our space from three to two. Suppose we enlarge X2 to a space X3 by attaching a second 2 cell B along the same cycle a − b . This gives a 2 dimensional chain group C2 x y da cb consisting of linear combinations of A and B , and the bound- ary homomorphism @2 : C2!C1 sends both A and B to a−b . The homology group H1—X3– … Ker @1= Im @2 is the same as for X2 , but now @2 has a nontrivial kernel, the inﬁnite cyclic group generated by A − B . We view A − B as a 2 dimensional cycle, generating the homology group H2—X3– … Ker @2 ˇ Z . Topologically, the cycle A − B is the sphere formed by the cells A and B together with their common boundary circle. This spherical cycle detects the presence of a ‘hole’ in X3 , the missing interior of the sphere. However, since this hole is enclosed by a sphere rather than a circle, it is of a different sort from the holes detected by H1—X3– ˇ Z\u0002 Z , which are detected by the cycles b − c and c − d . Let us continue one more step and construct a complex X4 from X3 by attaching a3 cell C along the 2 sphere formed by A and B . This creates a chain group C3 The Idea of Homology 101 generated by this 3 cell C , and we deﬁne a boundary homomorphism @3 : C3!C2 sending C to A − B since the cycle A − B should be viewed as the boundary of C in the same way that the 1 dimensional cycle a − b is the boundary of A . Now we have a sequence of three boundary homomorphisms C3 @3------------! C2 @2------------! C1 @1------------! C0 and the quotient H2—X4– … Ker @2= Im @3 has become trivial. Also H3—X4– … Ker @3 … 0. The group H1—X4– is the same as H1—X3– , namely Z\u0002 Z , so this is the only nontrivial homology group of X4 . It is clear what the general pattern of the examples is. For a cell complex X one has chain groups Cn—X– which are free abelian groups with basis the n cells of X , and there are boundary homomorphisms @n : Cn—X–!Cn−1—X– , in terms of which one deﬁnes the homology group Hn—X– … Ker @n= Im @n‡1 . The major difﬁculty is how to deﬁne @n in general. For n … 1 this is easy: The boundary of an oriented edge is the vertex at its head minus the vertex at its tail. The next case n … 2 is also not hard, at least for cells attached along cycles that are simply loops of edges, for then the boundary of the cell is this cycle of edges, with the appropriate signs taking orientations into account. But for larger n , matters become more complicated. Even if one restricts attention to cell complexes formed from polyhedral cells with nice attaching maps, there is still the matter of orientations to sort out. The best solution to this problem seems to be to adopt an indirect approach. Arbitrary polyhedra can always be subdivided into special polyhedra called simplices (the triangle and the tetrahedron are the 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional instances) so there is no loss of generality, though initially there is some loss of efﬁciency, in restricting attention entirely to simplices. For simplices there is no difﬁculty in deﬁn- ing boundary maps or in handling orientations. So one obtains a homology theory, called simplicial homology, for cell complexes built from simplices. Still, this is a rather restricted class of spaces, and the theory itself has a certain rigidity that makes it awkward to work with. The way around these obstacles is to step back from the geometry of spaces decomposed into simplices and to consider instead something which at ﬁrst glance seems wildly more complicated, the collection of all possible continuous maps of simplices into a given space X . These maps generate tremendously large chain groups Cn—X– , but the quotients Hn—X– … Ker @n= Im @n‡1 , called singular homology groups, turn out to be much smaller, at least for reasonably nice spaces X . In particular, for spaces like those in the four examples above, the singular homology groups coincide with the homology groups we computed from the cellular chains. And as we shall see later in this chapter, singular homology allows one to deﬁne these nice cellular homology groups for all cell complexes, and in particular to solve the problem of deﬁning the boundary maps for cellular chains. 102 Chapter 2 Homology The most important homology theory in algebraic topology, and the one we shall be studying almost exclusively, is called singular homology. Since the technical appa- ratus of singular homology is somewhat complicated, we will ﬁrst introduce a more primitive version called simplicial homology in order to see how some of the apparatus works in a simpler setting before beginning the general theory. The natural domain of deﬁnition for simplicial homology is a class of spaces we call Ñ complexes, which are a mild generalization of the more classical notion of a simplicial complex. Historically, the modern deﬁnition of singular homology was ﬁrst given in [Eilenberg 1944], and Ñ complexes were introduced soon thereafter in [Eilenberg-Zilber 1950] where they were called semisimplicial complexes. Within a few years this term came to be applied to what Eilenberg and Zilber called complete semisimplicial complexes, and later there was yet another shift in terminology as the latter objects came to be called simplicial sets. In theory this frees up the term semisimplicial complex to have its original meaning, but to avoid potential confusion it seems best to introduce a new name, and the term Ñ complex has at least the virtue of brevity. ∆–Complexes The torus, the projective plane, and the Klein bottle can each be obtained from a square by identifying opposite edges in the way indicated by the arrows in the follow- ing ﬁgures: b b a ac v vv v U L b b aac w vw v U L b b aac v vv v U L RP 2 T ::¡¡ K :¡¡¡¡¡ Cutting a square along a diagonal produces two triangles, so each of these surfaces can also be built from two triangles by identifying their edges in pairs. In similar fashion a polygon with any number of sides can be cut along diagonals into triangles, so in fact all closed surfaces can be constructed from triangles by identifying edges. Thus we have b b a a c c d d a single building block, the triangle, from which all surfaces can be constructed. Using only triangles we could also construct a large class of 2 dimensional spaces that are not surfaces in the strict sense, by allowing more than two edges to be identiﬁed together at a time. Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 103 The idea of a Ñ complex is to generalize constructions like these to any number of dimensions. The n dimensional analog of the triangle is the n simplex. This is the smallest convex set in a Euclidean space Rm containing n ‡ 1 points v0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn that do not lie in a hyperplane of dimen- sion less than n , where by a hyperplane we mean the set of solutions of a system vv 0 v 0v 0 1 v 2 v1 v1 v 2 v 3 v 0 of linear equations. An equivalent condi- tion would be that the difference vectors v1 − v0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn − v0 are linearly independent. The points vi are the vertices of the simplex, and the simplex itself is denoted ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ . For exam- ple, there is the standard n simplex v v 0 1 v 2 Ñn … \b —t0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;tn– 2 R n‡1 jjjj Piti … 1 and ti \u0015 0 for all i } whose vertices are the unit vectors along the coordinate axes. For purposes of homology it will be important to keep track of the order of the vertices of a simplex, so ‘ n simplex’ will really mean ‘ n simplex with an ordering of its vertices.’ A by-product of ordering the vertices of a simplex ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ is that this determines orientations of the edges ƒvi;vj⁄ according to increasing sub- scripts, as shown in the two preceding ﬁgures. Specifying the ordering of the vertices also determines a canonical linear homeomorphism from the standard n simplex Ñn onto any other n simplex ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ , preserving the order of vertices, namely, —t0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;tn–,P i tivi . The coefﬁcients ti are the barycentric coordinates of the point Pi tivi in ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ . If we delete one of the n ‡ 1 vertices of an n simplex ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ , then the remaining n vertices span an —n − 1– simplex, called a face of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ .We adopt the following convention: The vertices of a face, or of any subsimplex spanned by a subset of the vertices, will always be ordered according to their order in the larger simplex. The union of all the faces of Ñn is the boundary of Ñ n , written @Ñ n . The open simplex \u000e Ñ n is Ñn − @Ñn , the interior of Ñ n . A ∆ complex structure on a space X is a collection of maps ˙\u000b : Ñ n!X , with n depending on the index \u000b , such that: (i) The restriction ˙\u000b jj \u000e Ñn is injective, and each point of X is in the image of exactly one such restriction ˙\u000b jj \u000e Ñn . (ii) Each restriction of ˙\u000b to a face of Ñ n is one of the maps ˙\f : Ñ n−1!X . Here we are identifying the face of Ñn with Ñ n−1 by the canonical linear homeomorphism between them that preserves the ordering of the vertices. (iii) A set A ˆ X is open iff ˙ −1 \u000b —A– is open in Ñn for each ˙\u000b . 104 Chapter 2 Homology Among other things, this last condition rules out trivialities like regarding all the points of X as individual vertices. The earlier decompositions of the torus, projective plane, and Klein bottle into two triangles, three edges, and one or two vertices deﬁne Ñ complex structures with a total of six ˙\u000b ’s for the torus and Klein bottle and seven for the projective plane. The orientations on the edges in the pictures are compatible with a unique ordering of the vertices of each simplex, and these orderings determine the maps ˙\u000b . A consequence of (iii) is that X can be built as a quotient space of a collection of disjoint simplices Ñ n \u000b , one for each ˙\u000b : Ñ n!X , the quotient space obtained by identifying each face of a Ñn \u000b with the Ñn−1 \f corresponding to the restriction ˙\f of ˙\u000b to the face in question, as in condition (ii). One can think of building the quotient space inductively, starting with a discrete set of vertices, then attaching edges to these to produce a graph, then attaching 2 simplices to the graph, and so on. From this viewpoint we see that the data specifying a Ñ complex can be described purely combinatorially as collections of n simplices Ñ n \u000b for each n together with functions associating to each face of each n simplex Ñ n \u000b an —n − 1– simplex Ñ n−1 \f . More generally, Ñ complexes can be built from collections of disjoint simplices by identifying various subsimplices spanned by subsets of the vertices, where the iden- tiﬁcations are performed using the canonical linear homeomorphisms that preserve the orderings of the vertices. The earlier Ñ complex structures on a torus, projective plane, or Klein bottle can be obtained in this way, by identifying pairs of edges of two 2 simplices. If one starts with a single 2 simplex and identiﬁes all three edges to a single edge, preserving the orientations given by the ordering of the vertices, this produces a Ñ complex known as the ‘dunce cap.’ By contrast, if the three edges of a 2 simplex are identiﬁed preserving a cyclic orientation of the three edges, as in the ﬁrst ﬁgure at the right, this does not produce a Ñ complex structure, although if the 2 simplex is subdivided into three smaller 2 simplices about a central vertex, then one does obtain a Ñ complex structure on the quotient space. Thinking of a Ñ complex X as a quotient space of a collection of disjoint sim- plices, it is not hard to see that X must be a Hausdorff space. Condition (iii) then implies that each restriction ˙\u000b jj \u000e Ñn is a homeomorphism onto its image, which is thus an open simplex in X . It follows from Proposition A.2 in the Appendix that these open simplices ˙\u000b— \u000e Ñ n– are the cells en \u000b of a CW complex structure on X with the ˙\u000b ’s as characteristic maps. We will not need this fact at present, however. Simplicial Homology Our goal now is to deﬁne the simplicial homology groups of a Ñ complex X . Let Ñn—X– be the free abelian group with basis the open n simplices en \u000b of X . Elements Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 105 of Ñn—X– , called n chains, can be written as ﬁnite formal sums P \u000b n\u000ben \u000b with co- efﬁcients n\u000b 2 Z . Equivalently, we could write P \u000b n\u000b˙\u000b where ˙\u000b : Ñ n!X is the characteristic map of en \u000b , with image the closure of en \u000b as described above. Such a sum P\u000b n\u000b˙\u000b can be thought of as a ﬁnite collection, or ‘chain,’ of n simplices in X with integer multiplicities, the coefﬁcients n\u000b . As one can see in the next ﬁgure, the boundary of the n simplex ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ con- sists of the various —n−1– dimensional simplices ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ , where the ‘hat’ symbol b over vi indicates that this vertex is deleted from the sequence v0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn . In terms of chains, we might then wish to say that the boundary of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ is the —n − 1– chain formed by the sum of the faces ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ . However, it turns out to be better to insert certain signs and instead let the boundary of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ be Pi—−1– iƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ . Heuristically, the signs are inserted to take orientations into account, so that all the faces of a simplex are coherently oriented, as indicated in the following ﬁgure: v 0 v1 v2 v 3 vv 0 1 v 2 v 0 v 1 +- @ƒv0;v1⁄ … ƒv1⁄ − ƒv0⁄ @ƒv0;v1;v2⁄ … ƒv1;v2⁄ − ƒv0;v2⁄ ‡ ƒv0;v1⁄ @ƒv0;v1;v2;v3⁄ … ƒv1;v2;v3⁄ − ƒv0;v2;v3⁄ ‡ ƒv0;v1;v3⁄ − ƒv0;v1;v2⁄ In the last case, the orientations of the two hidden faces are also counterclockwise when viewed from outside the 3 simplex. With this geometry in mind we deﬁne for a general Ñ complex X a boundary homomorphism @n : Ñn—X–!Ñn−1—X– by specifying its values on basis elements: @n—˙\u000b– … X i —−1– i˙\u000b jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ Note that the right side of this equation does indeed lie in Ñn−1—X– since each restric- tion ˙\u000b jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ is the characteristic map of an —n − 1– simplex of X . Lemma 2.1. The composition Ñn—X– @n------------! Ñn−1—X– @n−1------------------! Ñn−2—X– is zero. Proof: We have @n—˙ – … P i—−1– i˙ jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ , and hence @n−1@n—˙ – … X j<i—−1– i—−1– j˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvj; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ ‡ X j>i —−1– i—−1– j−1˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvj; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ 106 Chapter 2 Homology The latter two summations cancel since after switching i and j in the second sum, it becomes the negative of the ﬁrst. tu The algebraic situation we have now is a sequence of homomorphisms of abelian groups \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Cn‡1 @n‡1-----------------! Cn @n------------! Cn−1 -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! C1 @1------------! C0 @0------------! 0 with @n@n‡1 … 0 for each n . Such a sequence is called a chain complex. Note that we have extended the sequence by a 0 at the right end, with @0 … 0 . From @n@n‡1 … 0 it follows that Im @n‡1 ˆ Ker @n , where Im and Ker denote image and kernel. So we can deﬁne the n th homology group of the chain complex to be the quotient group Hn … Ker @n= Im @n‡1 . Elements of Ker @n are called cycles and elements of Im @n‡1 are boundaries. Elements of Hn are cosets of Im @n‡1 , called homology classes. Two cycles representing the same homology class are said to be homologous. This means their difference is a boundary. Returning to the case that Cn … Ñn—X– , the homology group Ker @n= Im @n‡1 will be denoted HÑ n—X– and called the n th simplicial homology group of X . Example 2.2. X … S 1 , with one vertex v and one edge e . Then Ñ0—S 1– v e and Ñ1—S 1– are both Z and the boundary map @1 is zero since @e … v −v . The groups Ñn—S 1– are 0 for n \u0015 2 since there are no simplices in these dimensions. Hence HÑ n—S 1– ˇ ˆ Z for n … 0; 1 0 for n \u0015 2 This is an illustration of the general fact that if the boundary maps in a chain complex are all zero, then the homology groups of the complex are isomorphic to the chain groups themselves. Example 2.3. X … T , the torus with the Ñ complex structure pictured earlier, having one vertex, three edges a , b , and c , and two 2 simplices U and L . As in the previous example, @1 … 0so HÑ 0 —T – ˇ Z . Since @2U … a ‡ b − c … @2L and fa; b; a ‡ b − cg is a basis for Ñ1—T – , it follows that HÑ 1 —T – ˇ Z\b Z with basis the homology classes ƒa⁄ and ƒb⁄ . Since there are no 3 simplices, HÑ 2 —T – is equal to Ker @2 , which is inﬁnite cyclic generated by U − L since @—pU ‡ qL– … —p ‡ q–—a ‡ b − c– … 0 only if p …−q . Thus HÑ n—T – ˇ 8 < : Z \b Z for n … 1 Z for n … 0; 2 0 for n \u0015 3 Example 2.4. X … RP2 , as pictured earlier, with two vertices v and w , three edges a , b , and c , and two 2 simplices U and L . Then Im @1 is generated by w − v ,so HÑ 0 —X– ˇ Z with either vertex as a generator. Since @2U …−a‡b‡c and @2L … a−b‡c , we see that @2 is injective, so HÑ 2 —X– … 0 . Further, Ker @1 ˇ Z\b Z with basis a − b and c , and Im @2 is an index-two subgroup of Ker @1 since we can choose c and a − b ‡ c Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 107 as a basis for Ker @1 and a − b ‡ c and 2c … —a − b ‡ c– ‡ —−a ‡ b ‡ c– as a basis for Im @2 . Thus HÑ 1 —X– ˇ Z2 . Example 2.5. We can obtain a Ñ complex structure on S n by taking two copies of Ñ n and identifying their boundaries via the identity map. Labeling these two n simplices U and L , then it is obvious that Ker @n is inﬁnite cyclic generated by U − L . Thus HÑ n—S n– ˇ Z for this Ñ complex structure on S n . Computing the other homology groups would be more difﬁcult. Many similar examples could be worked out without much trouble, such as the other closed orientable and nonorientable surfaces. However, the calculations do tend to increase in complexity before long, particularly for higher-dimensional complexes. Some obvious general questions arise: Are the groups HÑ n—X– independent of the choice of Ñ complex structure on X ? In other words, if two Ñ complexes are homeomorphic, do they have isomorphic homology groups? More generally, do they have isomorphic homology groups if they are merely homotopy equivalent? To answer such questions and to develop a general theory it is best to leave the rather rigid simplicial realm and introduce the singular homology groups. These have the added advantage that they are deﬁned for all spaces, not just Ñ complexes. At the end of this section, after some theory has been developed, we will show that simplicial and singular homology groups coincide for Ñ complexes. Traditionally, simplicial homology is deﬁned for simplicial complexes, which are the Ñ complexes whose simplices are uniquely determined by their vertices. This amounts to saying that each n simplex has n ‡ 1 distinct vertices, and that no other n simplex has this same set of vertices. Thus a simplicial complex can be described combinatorially as a set X0 of vertices together with sets Xn of n simplices, which are —n ‡ 1– element subsets of X0 . The only requirement is that each —k ‡ 1– element subset of the vertices of an n simplex in Xn is a k simplex, in Xk . From this combi- natorial data a Ñ complex X can be constructed, once we choose a partial ordering of the vertices X0 that restricts to a linear ordering on the vertices of each simplex in Xn . For example, we could just choose a linear ordering of all the vertices. This might perhaps involve invoking the Axiom of Choice for large vertex sets. An exercise at the end of this section is to show that every Ñ complex can be subdivided to be a simplicial complex. In particular, every Ñ complex is then homeo- morphic to a simplicial complex. Compared with simplicial complexes, Ñ complexes have the advantage of simpler computations since fewer simplices are required. For example, to put a simplicial complex structure on the torus one needs at least 14 triangles, 21 edges, and 7 vertices, and for RP2 one needs at least 10 triangles, 15 edges, and 6 vertices. This would slow down calculations considerably! 108 Chapter 2 Homology Singular Homology A singular n simplex in a space X is by deﬁnition just a map ˙ : Ñ n!X . The word ‘singular’ is used here to express the idea that ˙ need not be a nice embedding but can have ‘singularities’ where its image does not look at all like a simplex. All that is required is that ˙ be continuous. Let Cn—X– be the free abelian group with basis the set of singular n simplices in X . Elements of Cn—X– , called n chains, or more precisely singular n chains, are ﬁnite formal sums P i ni˙i for ni 2 Z and ˙i : Ñ n!X . A boundary map @n : Cn—X–!Cn−1—X– is deﬁned by the same formula as before: @n—˙ – … X i —−1– i˙ jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ Implicit in this formula is the canonical identiﬁcation of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ with Ñn−1 , preserving the ordering of vertices, so that ˙ jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ is regarded as a map Ñn−1!X , that is, a singular —n − 1– simplex. Often we write the boundary map @n from Cn—X– to Cn−1—X– simply as @ when this does not lead to serious ambiguities. The proof of Lemma 2.1 applies equally well to singular simplices, showing that @n@n‡1 … 0 or more concisely @2 … 0 , so we can deﬁne the singular homology group Hn—X– … Ker @n= Im @n‡1 . It is evident from the deﬁnition that homeomorphic spaces have isomorphic sin- gular homology groups Hn , in contrast with the situation for HÑ n . On the other hand, since the groups Cn—X– are so large, the number of singular n simplices in X usually being uncountable, it is not at all clear that for a Ñ complex X with ﬁnitely many sim- plices, Hn—X– should be ﬁnitely generated for all n , or that Hn—X– should be zero for n larger than the dimension of X — two properties that are trivial for HÑ n—X– . Though singular homology looks so much more general than simplicial homology, it can actually be regarded as a special case of simplicial homology by means of the following construction. For an arbitrary space X , deﬁne the singular complex S—X– to be the Ñ complex with one n simplex Ñn ˙ for each singular n simplex ˙ : Ñ n!X , with Ñn ˙ attached in the obvious way to the —n − 1– simplices of S—X– that are the restrictions of ˙ to the various —n − 1– simplices in @Ñ n . It is clear from the deﬁni- tions that HÑ n( S—X– \u0001 is identical with Hn—X– for all n , and in this sense the singular homology group Hn—X– is a special case of a simplicial homology group. One can regard S—X– as a Ñ complex model for X , although it is usually an extremely large object compared to X . Cycles in singular homology are deﬁned algebraically, but they can be given a somewhat more geometric interpretation in terms of maps from ﬁnite Ñ complexes. To see this, note ﬁrst that a singular n chain ˘ can always be written in the form P i \"i˙i with \"i …\u00061 , allowing repetitions of the singular n simplices ˙i . Given such an n chain ˘ … P i \"i˙i , when we compute @˘ as a sum of singular —n − 1– simplices with signs \u00061 , there may be some canceling pairs consisting of two identical singu- lar —n − 1– simplices with opposite signs. Choosing a maximal collection of such Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 109 canceling pairs, construct an n dimensional Ñ complex K˘ from a disjoint union of n simplices Ñ n i , one for each ˙i , by identifying the pairs of —n−1– dimensional faces corresponding to the chosen canceling pairs. The ˙i ’s then induce a map K˘!X .If ˘ is a cycle, all the —n − 1– simplices of K˘ come from canceling pairs, hence are faces of exactly two n simplices of K˘ . Thus K˘ is a manifold, locally homeomorphic to Rn , except at a subcomplex of dimension at most n − 2 . All the n simplices of K˘ can be coherently oriented by taking the signs of the ˙i ’s into account, so K˘ is actually an oriented manifold away from its nonmanifold points. A closer inspection shows that K˘ is also a manifold near points in the interiors of —n − 2– simplices, so the nonmanifold points of K˘ in fact have dimension at most n − 3 . However, near the interiors of —n − 3– simplices it can very well happen that K˘ is not a manifold. In particular, elements of H1—X– are represented by collections of oriented loops in X , and elements of H2—X– are represented by maps of closed oriented surfaces into X . With a bit more work it can be shown that an oriented 1 cycle ` \u000bS 1 \u000b!X is zero in H1—X– iff it extends to a map of an oriented surface into X , and there is an analogous statement for 2 cycles. In the early days of homology theory it may have been believed, or at least hoped, that this close connection with manifolds continued in all higher dimensions, but this has turned out not to be the case. There is a sort of homology theory built from manifolds, called bordism, but it is quite a bit more complicated than the homology theory we are studying here. After these preliminary remarks let us begin to see what can be proved about singular homology. Proposition 2.6. Corresponding to the decomposition of a space X into its path- components X\u000b there is an isomorphism of Hn—X– with the direct sum L \u000b Hn—X\u000b– . Proof: Since a singular simplex always has path-connected image, Cn—X– splits as the direct sum of its subgroups Cn—X\u000b– . The boundary maps @n preserve this direct sum decomposition, taking Cn—X\u000b– to Cn−1—X\u000b– , so Ker @n and Im @n‡1 split similarly as direct sums, hence the homology groups also split, Hn—X– ˇ L \u000b Hn—X\u000b– . tu Proposition 2.7. If X is nonempty and path-connected, then H0—X– ˇ Z . Hence for any space X , H0—X– is a direct sum of Z ’s, one for each path-component of X . Proof: By deﬁnition, H0—X– … C0—X–= Im @1 since @0 … 0 . Deﬁne a homomorphism \" : C0—X–!Z by \"(P i ni˙i\u0001 … Pi ni . This is obviously surjective if X is nonempty. The claim is that Ker \" … Im @1 if X is path-connected, and hence \" induces an iso- morphism H0—X– ˇ Z . To verify the claim, observe ﬁrst that Im @1 ˆ Ker \" since for a singular 1 simplex ˙ : Ñ1!X we have \"@1—˙ – … \"( ˙ jj ƒv1⁄ − ˙ jj ƒv0⁄\u0001 … 1 − 1 … 0 . For the reverse inclusion Ker \" ˆ Im @1 , suppose \"(P i ni˙i\u0001 … 0, so Pi ni … 0 . The ˙i ’s are singular 0 simplices, which are simply points of X . Choose a path ˝i : I!X from a basepoint 110 Chapter 2 Homology x0 to ˙i—v0– and let ˙0 be the singular 0 simplex with image x0 . We can view ˝i as a singular 1 simplex, a map ˝i : ƒv0;v1⁄!X , and then we have @˝i … ˙i − ˙0 . Hence @(Pi ni˝i\u0001 … Pi ni˙i − Pi ni˙0 … Pi ni˙i since Pi ni … 0 . Thus Pi ni˙i is a boundary, which shows that Ker \" ˆ Im @1 . tu Proposition 2.8. If X is a point, then Hn—X– … 0 for n> 0 and H0—X– ˇ Z . Proof: In this case there is a unique singular n simplex ˙n for each n , and @—˙n– … Pi—−1– i˙n−1 , a sum of n ‡ 1 terms, which is therefore 0 for n odd and ˙n−1 for n even, n ﬂ 0 . Thus we have the chain complex \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Z ˇ------------! Z 0------------! Z ˇ------------! Z 0------------! Z -! 0 with boundary maps alternately isomorphisms and trivial maps, except at the last Z . The homology groups of this complex are trivial except for H0 ˇ Z . tu It is often very convenient to have a slightly modiﬁed version of homology for which a point has trivial homology groups in all dimensions, including zero. This is done by deﬁning the reduced homology groups eHn—X– to be the homology groups of the augmented chain complex \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! C2—X– @2------------! C1—X– @1------------! C0—X– \"------------! Z -! 0 where \"(Pi ni˙i\u0001 … P i ni as in the proof of Proposition 2.7. Here we had better require X to be nonempty, to avoid having a nontrivial homology group in dimension −1 . Since \"@1 … 0, \" vanishes on Im @1 and hence induces a map H0—X–!Z with kernel eH0—X– ,so H0—X– ˇ eH0—X–\b Z . Obviously Hn—X– ˇ eHn—X– for n> 0. Formally, one can think of the extra Z in the augmented chain complex as gener- ated by the unique map ƒ;⁄!X where ƒ;⁄ is the empty simplex, with no vertices. The augmentation map \" is then the usual boundary map since @ƒv0⁄ … ƒ bv0⁄ … ƒ;⁄ . Readers who know about the fundamental group ˇ1—X– may wish to make a detour here to look at x2.A where it is shown that H1—X– is the abelianization of ˇ1—X– whenever X is path-connected. This result will not be needed elsewhere in the chapter, however. Homotopy Invariance The ﬁrst substantial result we will prove about singular homology is that ho- motopy equivalent spaces have isomorphic homology groups. This will be done by showing that a map f : X!Y induces a homomorphism f\u0003 : Hn—X–!Hn—Y – for each n , and that f\u0003 is an isomorphism if f is a homotopy equivalence. For a map f : X!Y , an induced homomorphism f] : Cn—X–!Cn—Y – is deﬁned by composing each singular n simplex ˙ : Ñ n!X with f to get a singular n simplex Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 111 f]—˙ – … f˙ : Ñ n!Y , then extending f] linearly via f](P i ni˙i\u0001 … P i nif]—˙i– … Pi nif˙i . The maps f] : Cn—X–!Cn—Y – satisfy f]@ … @f] since f]@—˙ – … f](P i—−1– i˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄\u0001 … Pi—−1– if˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ … @f]—˙ – Thus we have a diagram¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! ]f ]f ]f -XCn 1()+¡¡¡¡¡!XCn 1()XCn() @@... ... ¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!-YCn 1()+ YCn 1()YCn() @@... ... such that in each square the composition f]@ equals the composition @f] . A diagram of maps with the property that any two compositions of maps starting at one point in the diagram and ending at another are equal is called a commutative diagram. In the present case commutativity of the diagram is equivalent to the commutativity relation f]@ … @f] , but commutative diagrams can contain commutative triangles, pentagons, etc., as well as commutative squares. The fact that the maps f] : Cn—X–!Cn—Y – satisfy f]@ … @f] is also expressed by saying that the f] ’s deﬁne a chain map from the singular chain complex of X to that of Y . The relation f]@ … @f] implies that f] takes cycles to cycles since @\u000b … 0 implies @—f]\u000b– … f]—@\u000b– … 0 . Also, f] takes boundaries to boundaries since f]—@\f– … @—f]\f– . Hence f] induces a homomorphism f\u0003 : Hn—X–!Hn—Y – .An algebraic statement of what we have just proved is: Proposition 2.9. A chain map between chain complexes induces homomorphisms between the homology groups of the two complexes. tu Two basic properties of induced homomorphisms which are important in spite of being rather trivial are: (i) —f g–\u0003 … f\u0003g\u0003 for a composed mapping X g -----! Y f -----! Z . This follows from associativity of compositions Ñn ˙-----! X g -----! Y f -----! Z . (ii) 11\u0003 … 11 where 11 denotes the identity map of a space or a group. Less trivially, we have: Theorem 2.10. If two maps f; g : X!Y are homotopic, then they induce the same homomorphism f\u0003 … g\u0003 : Hn—X–!Hn—Y – . In view of the formal properties —f g–\u0003 … f\u0003g\u0003 and 11\u0003 … 11 , this immediately implies: Corollary 2.11. The maps f\u0003 : Hn—X–!Hn—Y – induced by a homotopy equivalence f : X!Y are isomorphisms for all n . tu For example, if X is contractible then eHn—X– … 0 for all n . 112 Chapter 2 Homology Proof of 2.10: The essential ingredient is a procedure for subdividing the product Ñ n \u0002 I into —n‡1– simplices. The ﬁgure shows the cases n … 1; 2. In Ñn \u0002 I , let Ñ n \u0002f0g… ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ and Ñn \u0002f1g… ƒw0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ , where vi and wi have the same image under the projection Ñ n \u0002 I!Ñn . The n simplex ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wi‡1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ is the graph of v ww v 0 v 0 1 v 1 v 2 1 w 1 w 2 0 w 0 the linear function 'i : Ñ n!I deﬁned in barycentric co- ordinates by 'i—t0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;tn– … ti‡1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ tn since the vertices of this simplex ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wi‡1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ are on the graph of 'i and the simplex projects homeomorphi- cally onto Ñn under the projection Ñ n \u0002 I!Ñ n . The graph of 'i lies below the graph of 'i−1 since 'i \u0014 'i−1 , and the region between these two graphs is the simplex ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ , a true —n ‡ 1– simplex since wi is not on the graph of 'i and hence is not in the n simplex ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wi‡1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ . From the string of inequalities 0 … 'n \u0014 'n−1 \u0014 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0014 '0 \u0014 '−1 … 1 we deduce that Ñn \u0002 I is the union of the —n ‡ 1– simplices ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ , each intersecting the next in an n simplex face. Given a homotopy F : X \u0002 I!Y from f to g , we can deﬁne prism operators P : Cn—X–!Cn‡1—Y – by P—˙ – … X i —−1– iF \u000e —˙ \u0002 11– jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ for ˙ : Ñn!X , where F \u000e —˙ \u0002 11– is the composition Ñ n \u0002 I!X \u0002 I!Y . We will show that these prism operators satisfy the basic relation @P … g] − f] − P@ Geometrically, the left side of this equation represents the boundary of the prism, and the three terms on the right side represent the top Ñ n \u0002f1g , the bottom Ñ n \u0002f0g , and the sides @Ñn \u0002 I of the prism. To prove the relation we calculate @P —˙ – … X j\u0014i —−1– i—−1– jF \u000e—˙ \u0002 11–jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvj; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ ‡ X j\u0015i—−1– i—−1– j‡1F \u000e—˙ \u0002 11–jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; cwj; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ The terms with i … j in the two sums cancel except for F \u000e —˙ \u0002 11– jj ƒ bv0;w0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ , which is g \u000e ˙ … g]—˙ – , and −F \u000e —˙ \u0002 11– jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn; cwn⁄ , which is −f \u000e ˙ …−f]—˙ – .

If \u000b 2 Cn—X– is a cycle, then we have g]—\u000b– − f]—\u000b– … @P —\u000b– ‡ P @—\u000b– … @P —\u000b– since @\u000b … 0 . Thus g]—\u000b– − f]—\u000b– is a boundary, so g]—\u000b– and f]—\u000b– determine the same homology class, which means that g\u0003 equals f\u0003 on the homology class of \u000b . tu The relationship @P ‡ P@ … g] − f] is expressed by saying P is a chain homotopy between the chain maps f] and g] . We have just shown: Proposition 2.12. Chain-homotopic chain maps induce the same homomorphism on homology. tu There are also induced homomorphisms f\u0003 : eHn—X–! eHn—Y – for reduced homol- ogy groups since f]\" … \"f] . The properties of induced homomorphisms we proved above hold equally well in the setting of reduced homology, with the same proofs. Exact Sequences and Excision It would be nice if there was always a simple relationship between the homology groups of a space X , a subspace A , and the quotient space X=A . For then one could hope to understand the homology groups of spaces such as CW complexes that can be built inductively from successively more complicated subspaces. Perhaps the simplest possible relationship would be if Hn—X– contained Hn—A– as a subgroup and the quotient group Hn—X–=Hn—A– was isomorphic to Hn—X=A– . While this does hold in some cases, if it held in general then homology theory would collapse totally since every space X can be embedded as a subspace of a space with trivial homology groups, namely the cone CX … —X \u0002 I–=—X \u0002f0g– , which is contractible. It turns out that this overly simple model does not have to be modiﬁed too much to get a relationship that is valid in fair generality. The novel feature of the actual relationship is that it involves the groups Hn—X– , Hn—A– , and Hn—X=A– for all values of n simultaneously. In practice this is not as bad as it might sound, and in addition it has the pleasant side effect of sometimes allowing higher-dimensional homology groups to be computed in terms of lower-dimensional groups, which may already be known by induction for example. In order to formulate the relationship we are looking for, we need an algebraic deﬁnition which is central to algebraic topology. A sequence of homomorphisms \u0001\u0001\u0001 ---------! An‡1 \u000bn‡1-------------------------! An \u000bn------------------! An−1 ---------! \u0001\u0001\u0001 is said to be exact if Ker \u000bn … Im \u000bn‡1 for each n . The inclusions Im \u000bn‡1 ˆ Ker \u000bn are equivalent to \u000bn\u000bn‡1 … 0 , so the sequence is a chain complex, and the opposite inclusions Ker \u000bn ˆ Im \u000bn‡1 say that the homology groups of this chain complex are trivial. 114 Chapter 2 Homology A number of basic algebraic concepts can be expressed in terms of exact se- quences, for example: (i) 0 -! A \u000b-----! B is exact iff Ker \u000b … 0 , i.e., \u000b is injective. (ii) A \u000b-----! B -! 0 is exact iff Im \u000b … B , i.e., \u000b is surjective. (iii) 0 -! A \u000b-----! B -! 0 is exact iff \u000b is an isomorphism, by (i) and (ii). (iv) 0 -! A \u000b-----! B \f -----! C -! 0 is exact iff \u000b is injective, \f is surjective, and Ker \f … Im \u000b ,so \f induces an isomorphism C ˇ B= Im \u000b . This can be written C ˇ B=A if we think of \u000b as an inclusion of A as a subgroup of B . An exact sequence 0!A!B!C!0 as in (iv) is called a short exact sequence. Exact sequences provide the right tool to relate the homology groups of a space, a subspace, and the associated quotient space: Theorem 2.13. If X is a space and A is a nonempty closed subspace that is a defor- mation retract of some neighborhood in X , then there is an exact sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 -----! eHn—A– i\u0003------------! eHn—X– j\u0003------------! eHn—X=A– @-----! eHn−1—A– i\u0003------------! eHn−1—X– -----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0001\u0001\u0001 -----! eH0—X=A– -----! 0 where i is the inclusion A > X and j is the quotient map X!X=A . The map @ will be constructed in the course of the proof. The idea is that an element x 2 eHn—X=A– can be represented by a chain \u000b in X with @\u000b a cycle in A whose homology class is @x 2 eHn−1—A– . Pairs of spaces —X; A– satisfying the hypothesis of the theorem will be called good pairs. For example, if X is a CW complex and A is a nonempty subcomplex, then —X; A– is a good pair by Proposition A.5 in the Appendix. Corollary 2.14. eHn—S n– ˇ Z and eHi—S n– … 0 for i ﬂ n . Proof: For n> 0 take —X; A– … —Dn;S n−1– so X=A … S n . The terms eHi—Dn– in the long exact sequence for this pair are zero since Dn is contractible. Exactness of the sequence then implies that the maps eHi—S n– @-----! eHi−1—S n−1– are isomorphisms for i> 0 and that eH0—S n– … 0 . The result now follows by induction on n , starting with the case of S 0 where the result holds by Propositions 2.6 and 2.8. tu As an application of this calculation we have the following classical theorem of Brouwer, the 2 dimensional case of which was proved in x1.1. Corollary 2.15. @Dn is not a retract of Dn . Hence every map f : Dn!Dn has a ﬁxed point. Proof:If r : Dn!@Dn is a retraction, then ri … 11 for i : @Dn!Dn the inclusion map. The composition eHn−1—@Dn– i\u0003------------! eHn−1—Dn– r\u0003------------! eHn−1—@Dn– is then the identity map Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 115 on eHn−1—@Dn– ˇ Z . But i\u0003 and r\u0003 are both 0 since eHn−1—Dn– … 0 , and we have a contradiction. The statement about ﬁxed points follows as in Theorem 1.9. tu The derivation of the exact sequence of homology groups for a good pair —X; A– will be rather a long story. We will in fact derive a more general exact sequence which holds for arbitrary pairs —X; A– , but with the homology groups of the quotient space X=A replaced by relative homology groups, denoted Hn—X; A– . These turn out to be quite useful for many other purposes as well. Relative Homology Groups It sometimes happens that by ignoring a certain amount of data or structure one obtains a simpler, more ﬂexible theory which, almost paradoxically, can give results not readily obtainable in the original setting. A familiar instance of this is arithmetic mod n , where one ignores multiples of n . Relative homology is another example. In this case what one ignores is all singular chains in a subspace of the given space. Relative homology groups are deﬁned in the following way. Given a space X and a subspace A ˆ X , let Cn—X; A– be the quotient group Cn—X–=Cn—A– . Thus chains in A are trivial in Cn—X; A– . Since the boundary map @ : Cn—X–!Cn−1—X– takes Cn—A– to Cn−1—A– , it induces a quotient boundary map @ : Cn—X; A–!Cn−1—X; A– . Letting n vary, we have a sequence of boundary maps \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Cn—X; A– @------------! Cn−1—X; A– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 The relation @2 … 0 holds for these boundary maps since it holds before passing to quotient groups. So we have a chain complex, and the homology groups Ker @= Im @ of this chain complex are by deﬁnition the relative homology groups Hn—X; A– .By considering the deﬁnition of the relative boundary map we see: Elements of Hn—X; A– are represented by relative cycles: n chains \u000b 2 Cn—X– such that @\u000b 2 Cn−1—A– . A relative cycle \u000b is trivial in Hn—X; A– iff it is a relative boundary: \u000b … @\f ‡ γ for some \f 2 Cn‡1—X– and γ 2 Cn—A– . These properties make precise the intuitive idea that Hn—X; A– is ‘homology of X modulo A .’ The quotient Cn—X–=Cn—A– could also be viewed as a subgroup of Cn—X– , the subgroup with basis the singular n simplices ˙ : Ñ n!X whose image is not con- tained in A . However, the boundary map does not take this subgroup of Cn—X– to the corresponding subgroup of Cn−1—X– , so it is usually better to regard Cn—X; A– as a quotient rather than a subgroup of Cn—X– . Our goal now is to show that the relative homology groups Hn—X; A– for any pair —X; A– ﬁt into a long exact sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Hn—A– -! Hn—X– -! Hn—X; A– -! Hn−1—A– -!

We will show that when we pass to homology groups, this short exact sequence of chain complexes stretches out into a long exact sequence of homol- ogy groups \u0001\u0001\u0001 -!

Hn−1—B– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 where Hn—A– denotes the homology group Ker @= Im @ at An in the chain complex A , and Hn—B– and Hn—C– are deﬁned similarly. The commutativity of the squares in the short exact sequence of chain complexes means that i and j are chain maps. These therefore induce maps i\u0003 and j\u0003 on homology. To deﬁne the boundary map @ : Hn—C–!Hn−1—A– , let c 2 Cn be a cycle. Since j is onto, c … j—b– for some b 2 Bn . The element @b 2 Bn−1 is in Ker j since j—@b– … @j—b– … @c … 0. So @b … i—a– for some a 2 An−1 since Ker j … Im i . Note that @a … 0 since i—@a– … @i—a– … @@b … 0 and i is injective. We deﬁne @ : Hn—C–!Hn−1—A– by sending the homology class of c to the homology class of a , @ƒc⁄ … ƒa⁄ . This is well-deﬁned since: Cn BBn A -n 1 -n 1 ¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡! a bb c @ @ - ¡¡¡!-¡¡¡!- i j The element a is uniquely determined by @b since i is injective. A different choice b0 for b would have j—b0– … j—b– ,so b0 − b is in Ker j … Im i . Thus b0 − b … i—a 0– for some a 0 , hence b0 … b ‡ i—a 0– . The effect of replacing b by b ‡ i—a0– is to change a to the homologous element a ‡ @a 0 since i—a ‡ @a 0– … i—a– ‡ i—@a0– … @b ‡ @i—a 0– … @—b ‡ i—a 0–– . A different choice of c within its homology class would have the form c ‡ @c0 . Since c0 … j—b0– for some b0 , we then have c ‡ @c0 … c ‡ @j—b0– … c ‡ j—@b0– … j—b ‡ @b0– ,so b is replaced by b ‡ @b0 , which leaves @b and therefore also a unchanged. Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 117 The map @ : Hn—C–!Hn−1—A– is a homomorphism since if @ƒc1⁄ … ƒa1⁄ and @ƒc2⁄ … ƒa2⁄ via elements b1 and b2 as above, then j—b1 ‡ b2– … j—b1– ‡ j—b2– … c1 ‡ c2 and i—a1 ‡ a2– … i—a1– ‡ i—a2– … @b1 ‡ @b2 … @—b1 ‡ b2– ,so @—ƒc1⁄ ‡ ƒc2⁄– … ƒa1⁄ ‡ ƒa2⁄ .

We have @j\u0003 … 0 since in this case @b … 0 in the deﬁnition of @ . Im @ ˆ Ker i\u0003 . Here i\u0003@ … 0 since i\u0003@ takes ƒc⁄ to ƒ@b⁄ … 0. Ker j\u0003 ˆ Im i\u0003 . A homology class in Ker j\u0003 is represented by a cycle b 2 Bn with j—b– a boundary, so j—b– … @c0 for some c0 2 Cn‡1 . Since j is surjective, c0 … j—b0– for some b0 2 Bn‡1 . We have j—b − @b0– … j—b– − j—@b0– … j—b– − @j—b0– … 0 since @j—b0– … @c0 … j—b– .So b − @b0 … i—a– for some a 2 An . This a is a cycle since i—@a– … @i—a– … @—b − @b0– … @b … 0 and i is injective. Thus i\u0003ƒa⁄ … ƒb − @b0⁄ … ƒb⁄ , showing that i\u0003 maps onto Ker j\u0003 . Ker @ ˆ Im j\u0003 .

Given a cycle a 2 An−1 such that i—a– … @b for some b 2 Bn , then j—b– is a cycle since @j—b– … j—@b– … ji—a– … 0 , and @ takes ƒj—b–⁄ to ƒa⁄ . tu This theorem represents the beginnings of the subject of homological algebra. The method of proof is sometimes called diagram chasing. Returning to topology, the preceding algebraic theorem yields a long exact se- quence of homology groups: \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Hn—A– i\u0003------------! Hn—X– j\u0003------------! Hn—X; A– @-----! Hn−1—A– i\u0003------------! Hn−1—X– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! H0—X; A– -! 0 The boundary map @ : Hn—X; A–!Hn−1—A– has a very simple description: If a class ƒ\u000b⁄ 2 Hn—X; A– is represented by a relative cycle \u000b , then @ƒ\u000b⁄ is the class of the cycle @\u000b in Hn−1—A– . This is immediate from the algebraic deﬁnition of the boundary homomorphism in the long exact sequence of homology groups associated to a short exact sequence of chain complexes. This long exact sequence makes precise the idea that the groups Hn—X; A– mea- sure the difference between the groups Hn—X– and Hn—A– . In particular, exactness 118 Chapter 2 Homology implies that if Hn—X; A– … 0 for all n , then the inclusion A>X induces isomorphisms Hn—A– ˇ Hn—X– for all n , by the remark (iii) following the deﬁnition of exactness. The converse is also true according to an exercise at the end of this section. There is a completely analogous long exact sequence of reduced homology groups for a pair —X; A– with A ﬂ ; . This comes from applying the preceding algebraic ma- chinery to the short exact sequence of chain complexes formed by the short exact se- quences 0!Cn—A–!Cn—X–!Cn—X; A–!0 in nonnegative dimensions, augmented by the short exact sequence 0 -! Z 11-----! Z -! 0 -! 0 in dimension −1 . In particular this means that eHn—X; A– is the same as Hn—X; A– for all n , when A ﬂ ; . Example 2.17. In the long exact sequence of reduced homology groups for the pair —Dn;@Dn– , the maps Hi—Dn;@Dn– @-----! eHi−1—S n−1– are isomorphisms for all i> 0 since the remaining terms eHi—Dn– are zero for all i . Thus we obtain the calculation Hi—Dn;@Dn– ˇ ˆ Z for i … n 0 otherwise Example 2.18. Applying the long exact sequence of reduced homology groups to a pair —X; x0– with x0 2 X yields isomorphisms Hn—X; x0– ˇ eHn—X– for all n since eHn—x0– … 0 for all n . There are induced homomorphisms for relative homology just as there are in the nonrelative, or ‘absolute,’ case. A map f : X!Y with f —A– ˆ B , or more concisely f : —X; A–!—Y ; B– , induces homomorphisms f] : Cn—X; A–!Cn—Y ; B– since the chain map f] : Cn—X–!Cn—Y – takes Cn—A– to Cn—B– , so we get a well-deﬁned map on quo- tients, f] : Cn—X; A–!Cn—Y ; B– . The relation f]@ … @f] holds for relative chains since it holds for absolute chains. By Proposition 2.9 we then have induced homomorphisms f\u0003 : Hn—X; A–!Hn—Y ; B– . Proposition 2.19. If two maps f; g : —X; A–!—Y ; B– are homotopic through maps of pairs —X; A–!—Y ; B– , then f\u0003 … g\u0003 : Hn—X; A–!Hn—Y ; B– . Proof: The prism operator P from the proof of Theorem 2.10 takes Cn—A– to Cn‡1—B– , hence induces a relative prism operator P : Cn—X; A–!Cn‡1—Y ; B– . Since we are just passing to quotient groups, the formula @P ‡ P@ … g] − f] remains valid. Thus the maps f] and g] on relative chain groups are chain homotopic, and hence they induce the same homomorphism on relative homology groups. tu An easy generalization of the long exact sequence of a pair —X; A– is the long exact sequence of a triple —X;A;B– , where B ˆ A ˆ X : \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Hn—A; B– -! Hn—X; B– -! Hn—X; A– -! Hn−1—A; B– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 This is the long exact sequence of homology groups associated to the short exact sequence of chain complexes formed by the short exact sequences 0 -! Cn—A; B– -! Cn—X; B– -! Cn—X; A– -! 0 Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 119 For example, taking B to be a point, the long exact sequence of the triple —X;A;B– becomes the long exact sequence of reduced homology for the pair —X; A– . Excision A fundamental property of relative homology groups is given by the following Excision Theorem, describing when the relative groups Hn—X; A– are unaffected by deleting, or excising, a subset Z ˆ A . Theorem 2.20. Given subspaces Z ˆ A ˆ X such that the closure of Z is contained in the interior of A , then the inclusion —X − Z; A − Z– > —X; A– induces isomor- phisms Hn—X − Z; A − Z–!Hn—X; A– for all n . Equivalently, for subspaces A; B ˆ X whose interiors cover X , the inclusion —B; A \\ B– > —X; A– induces isomorphisms Hn—B; A \\ B–!Hn—X; A– for all n . AZ X The translation between the two versions is obtained by setting B … X − Z and Z … X − B . Then A \\ B … A − Z and the condition cl Z ˆ int A is equivalent to X … int A [ int B since X − int B … cl Z . The proof of the excision theorem will involve a rather lengthy technical detour involving a construction known as barycentric subdivision, which allows homology groups to be computed using small singular simplices. In a metric space ‘smallness’ can be deﬁned in terms of diameters, but for general spaces it will be deﬁned in terms of covers. For a space X , let U …fUjg be a collection of subspaces of X whose interiors form an open cover of X , and let C U n —X– be the subgroup of Cn—X– consisting of chains Pi ni˙i such that each ˙i has image contained in some set in the cover U . The boundary map @ : Cn—X–!Cn−1—X– takes C U n —X– to C U n−1—X– , so the groups CU n —X– form a chain complex. We denote the homology groups of this chain complex by HU n —X– . Proposition 2.21. The inclusion \u0013 : CU n —X– > Cn—X– is a chain homotopy equiva- lence, that is, there is a chain map ˆ : Cn—X–!CU n —X– such that \u0013ˆ and ˆ\u0013 are chain homotopic to the identity. Hence \u0013 induces isomorphisms HU n —X– ˇ Hn—X– for all n . Proof: The barycentric subdivision process will be performed at four levels, beginning with the most geometric and becoming increasingly algebraic. (1) Barycentric Subdivision of Simplices. The points of a simplex ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ are the linear combinations Pi tivi with Pi ti … 1 and ti \u0015 0 for each i . The barycenter or ‘center of gravity’ of the simplex ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ is the point b … P i tivi whose barycen- tric coordinates ti are all equal, namely ti … 1=—n ‡ 1– for each i . The barycentric subdivision of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ is the decomposition of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ into the n simplices ƒb; w0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn−1⁄ where, inductively, ƒw0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn−1⁄ is an —n − 1– simplex in the 120 Chapter 2 Homology barycentric subdivision of a face ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ . The induction starts with the case n … 0 when the barycentric subdivision of ƒv0⁄ is deﬁned to be just ƒv0⁄ itself. The next two cases n … 1; 2 and part of the case n … 3 are shown in the ﬁgure. It follows from the inductive deﬁnition that the ver- vv 0 v b b b 0 1 v 2 v 1 v 0 v 1 v2 v 3tices of simplices in the barycen- tric subdivision of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ are exactly the barycenters of all the k dimensional faces ƒvi0 ; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vik ⁄ of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ for 0 \u0014 k \u0014 n . When k … 0 this gives the original vertices vi since the barycenter of a 0 simplex is itself. The barycen- ter of ƒvi0 ; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vik ⁄ has barycentric coordinates ti … 1=—k ‡ 1– for i … i0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;ik and ti … 0 otherwise. The n simplices of the barycentric subdivision of Ñ n , together with all their faces, do in fact form a Ñ complex structure on Ñ n , indeed a simplicial complex structure, though we shall not need to know this in what follows. A fact we will need is that the diameter of each simplex of the barycentric subdivi- sion of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ is at most n=—n‡1– times the diameter of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ . Here the diameter of a simplex is by deﬁnition the maximum distance between any two of its points, and we are using the metric from the ambient Euclidean space Rm containing ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ . The diameter of a simplex equals the maximum distance between any of its vertices because the distance between two points v and P i tivi of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ satisﬁes the inequality \f \fv − Pitivi\f \f … \f \fP iti—v − vi–\f \f \u0014 P itijv − vij\u0014 P iti max jv − vij… max jv − vij To obtain the bound n=—n ‡ 1– on the ratio of diameters, we therefore need to verify that the distance between any two vertices wj and wk of a simplex ƒw0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ of the barycentric subdivision of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ is at most n=—n‡1– times the diameter of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ . If neither wi nor wj is the barycenter b of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ , then these two points lie in a proper face of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ and we are done by induction on n .So we may suppose wj , say, is the barycenter b , and then by the previous displayed inequal- ity we may take wk to be a vertex vi . Let bi be the barycenter of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ , with all barycentric coordinates equal to 1=n except for ti … 0 . Then we have b … 1 n‡1 vi ‡ n n‡1 bi . The b b vi i sum of the two coefﬁcients is 1 , so b lies on the line segment ƒvi;bi⁄ from vi to bi , and the distance from b to vi is n=—n ‡ 1– times the length of ƒvi;bi⁄ . Hence the distance from b to vi is bounded by n=—n ‡ 1– times the diameter of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ . The signiﬁcance of the factor n=—n‡1– is that by repeated barycentric subdivision we can produce simplices of arbitrarily small diameter since ( n=—n‡1–\u0001r approaches Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 121 0as r goes to inﬁnity. It is important that the bound n=—n ‡ 1– does not depend on the shape of the simplex since repeated barycentric subdivision produces simplices of many different shapes. (2) Barycentric Subdivision of Linear Chains. The main part of the proof will be to construct a subdivision operator S : Cn—X–!Cn—X– and show this is chain homotopic to the identity map. First we will construct S and the chain homotopy in a more restricted linear setting. For a convex set Y in some Euclidean space, the linear maps Ñ n!Y generate a subgroup of Cn—Y – that we denote LCn—Y – , the linear chains. The boundary map @ : Cn—Y –!Cn−1—Y – takes LCn—Y – to LCn−1—Y – , so the linear chains form a subcom- plex of the singular chain complex of Y . We can uniquely designate a linear map \u0015 : Ñn!Y by ƒw0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ where wi is the image under \u0015 of the i th vertex of Ñ n . To avoid having to make exceptions for 0 simplices it will be convenient to augment the complex LC—Y – by setting LC−1—Y – … Z generated by the empty simplex ƒ;⁄ , with @ƒw0⁄ … ƒ;⁄ for all 0 simplices ƒw0⁄ . Each point b 2 Y determines a homomorphism b : LCn—Y –!LCn‡1—Y – deﬁned on basis elements by b—ƒw0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄– … ƒb; w0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ . Geometrically, the homo- morphism b can be regarded as a cone operator, sending a linear chain to the cone having the linear chain as the base of the cone and the point b as the tip of the cone. Applying the usual formula for @ , we obtain the relation @b—ƒw0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄– … ƒw0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ − b—@ƒw0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄– . By linearity it follows that @b—\u000b– … \u000b − b—@\u000b– for all \u000b 2 LCn—Y – . This expresses algebraically the geometric fact that the boundary of a cone consists of its base together with the cone on the boundary of its base. The relation @b—\u000b– … \u000b−b—@\u000b– can be rewritten as @b ‡b@ … 11, so b is a chain homotopy between the identity map and the zero map on the augmented chain complex LC—Y – . Now we deﬁne a subdivision homomorphism S : LCn—Y –!LCn—Y – by induction on n . Let \u0015 : Ñn!Y be a generator of LCn—Y – and let b\u0015 be the image of the barycenter of Ñn under \u0015 . Then the inductive formula for S is S—\u0015– … b\u0015—S@\u0015– where b\u0015 : LCn−1—Y –!LCn—Y – is the cone operator deﬁned in the preceding para- graph. The induction starts with S—ƒ;⁄– … ƒ;⁄ ,so S is the identity on LC−1—Y – . It is also the identity on LC0—Y – , since when n … 0 the formula for S becomes S—ƒw0⁄– … w0—S@ƒw0⁄– … w0—S—ƒ;⁄–– … w0—ƒ;⁄– … ƒw0⁄ . When \u0015 is an embed- ding, with image a genuine n simplex ƒw0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ , then S—\u0015– is the sum of the n simplices in the barycentric subdivision of ƒw0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ , with certain signs that could be computed explicitly. This is apparent by comparing the inductive deﬁnition of S with the inductive deﬁnition of the barycentric subdivision of a simplex. Let us check that the maps S satisfy @S … S@ , and hence give a chain map from the chain complex LC—Y – to itself. Since S … 11on LC0—Y – and LC−1—Y – , we certainly have @S … S@ on LC0—Y – . The result for larger n is given by the following calculation, in which we omit some parentheses to unclutter the formulas: 122 Chapter 2 Homology @S\u0015 … @( b\u0015—S@\u0015–\u0001 … S@\u0015 − b\u0015—@S@\u0015– since @b\u0015 ‡ b\u0015@ … 11 … S@\u0015 − b\u0015—S@@\u0015– by induction on n … S@\u0015 since @@ … 0 We next build a chain homotopy T : LCn—Y –!LCn‡1—Y – between S and the iden- tity, ﬁtting into a diagram¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!

The geometric motivation for this formula is an inductively deﬁned subdivision of Ñ n \u0002 I obtained by joining all simplices in Ñ n \u0002f0g[ @Ñn \u0002 I to the barycenter of Ñn \u0002f1g , as indicated in the ﬁgure in the case n … 2 . What T actually does is take the image of this sub- division under the projection Ñ n \u0002 I!Ñ n . The chain homotopy formula @T ‡ T@ … 11 − S is trivial on LC−1—Y – where T … 0 and S … 11 . Verifying the formula on LCn—Y – with n \u0015 0 is done by the calculation @T \u0015 … @( b\u0015—\u0015 − T@\u0015– \u0001 … \u0015 − T@\u0015 − b\u0015( @—\u0015 − T@\u0015– \u0001 since @b\u0015 … 11 − b\u0015@ … \u0015 − T@\u0015 − b\u0015—S@\u0015 ‡ T @@\u0015– by induction on n … \u0015 − T@\u0015 − S\u0015 since @@ … 0 and S\u0015 … b\u0015—S@\u0015– Now we are done with inductive arguments and we can discard the group LC−1—Y – which was used only as a convenience. The relation @T ‡T@ … 11−S still holds without LC−1—Y – since T was zero on LC−1—Y – . (3) Barycentric Subdivision of General Chains. Deﬁne S : Cn—X–!Cn—X– by setting S˙ … ˙]SÑn for a singular n simplex ˙ : Ñ n!X . Since SÑn is the sum of the n simplices in the barycentric subdivision of Ñ n , with certain signs, S˙ is the corre- sponding signed sum of the restrictions of ˙ to the n simplices of the barycentric subdivision of Ñn . The operator S is a chain map since @S˙ … @˙]SÑ n … ˙]@SÑ n … ˙]S@Ñ n … ˙]S(P i—−1– iÑn i \u0001 where Ñ n i is the i th face of Ñ n … P i—−1– i˙]SÑ n i … P i—−1– iS—˙ jjÑ n i – … S(Pi—−1– i˙ jjÑ n i \u0001 … S—@˙ – Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 123 In similar fashion we deﬁne T : Cn—X–!Cn‡1—X– by T˙ … ˙]T Ñ n , and this gives a chain homotopy between S and the identity, since the formula @T ‡ T@ … 11 − S holds by the calculation @T ˙ … @˙]T Ñ n … ˙]@T Ñ n … ˙]—Ñ n − SÑn − T@Ñ n– … ˙ − S˙ − ˙]T@Ñ n … ˙ − S˙ − T—@˙ – where the last equality follows just as in the previous displayed calculation, with S replaced by T . (4) Iterated Barycentric Subdivision. A chain homotopy between 11 and the iterate S m is given by the operator Dm … P 0\u0014i<m TS i since @Dm ‡ Dm@ … X 0\u0014i<m ( @T S i ‡ TS i@\u0001 … X 0\u0014i<m ( @T S i ‡ T@S i\u0001 … X 0\u0014i<m ( @T ‡ T@\u0001 S i … X 0\u0014i<m (11 − S\u0001 S i … X 0\u0014i<m ( S i − S i‡1\u0001 … 11 − S m For each singular n simplex ˙ : Ñ n!X there exists an m such that S m—˙ – lies in C U n —X– since the diameter of the simplices of S m—Ñ n– will be less than a Lebesgue number of the cover of Ñn by the open sets ˙ −1—int Uj– if m is large enough. (Recall that a Lebesgue number for an open cover of a compact metric space is a number \"> 0 such that every set of diameter less than \" lies in some set of the cover; such a number exists by an elementary compactness argument.) We cannot expect the same number m to work for all ˙ ’s, so let us deﬁne m—˙ – to be the smallest m such that S m˙ is in C U n —X– . Suppose we deﬁne D : Cn—X–!Cn‡1—X– by D˙ … Dm—˙ –˙ . To see whether D is a chain homotopy, we manipulate the chain homotopy equation @Dm—˙ –˙ ‡ Dm—˙ –@˙ … ˙ − S m—˙ –˙ into an equation whose left side is @D˙ ‡ D@˙ by moving the second term on the left side to the other side of the equation and adding D@˙ to both sides: @D˙ ‡ D@˙ … ˙ − \u0002S m—˙ –˙ ‡ Dm—˙ –—@˙ – − D—@˙ – \u0003 If we deﬁne ˆ—˙ – to be the expression in brackets in this last equation, then this equation has the form —\u0003–@D˙ ‡ D@˙ … ˙ − ˆ—˙ – We claim that ˆ—˙ – 2 C U n —X– . This is obvious for the term S m—˙ –˙ . For the remaining part Dm—˙ –—@˙ – − D—@˙ – , note ﬁrst that if ˙j denotes the restriction of ˙ to the j th face of Ñ n , then m—˙j– \u0014 m—˙ – , so every term TS i—˙j– in D—@˙ – will be a term in Dm—˙ –—@˙ – . Thus Dm—˙ –—@˙ – − D—@˙ – is a sum of terms TS i—˙j– with i \u0015 m—˙j– , and these terms lie in C U n —X– since T takes C U n−1—X– to C U n —X– We can thus regard the equation —\u0003– as deﬁning ˆ : Cn—X–!CU n —X– . For varying n these ˆ ’s form a chain map since —\u0003– implies @ˆ—˙ – … @˙ − @D@—˙ – … ˆ—@˙ – . 124 Chapter 2 Homology The equation —\u0003– says that @D ‡ D@ … 11 − \u0013ˆ for \u0013 : CU n —X– > Cn—X– the inclusion. Furthermore, ˆ\u0013 … 11 since D is identically zero on CU n —X– ,as m—˙ – … 0if ˙ is in C U n —X– , hence the summation deﬁning D˙ is empty. Thus we have shown that ˆ is a chain homotopy inverse for \u0013 . tu Proof of the Excision Theorem: We prove the second version, involving a decom- position X … A [ B . For the cover U …fA; Bg we introduce the suggestive notation Cn—A ‡ B– for C U n —X– , the sums of chains in A and chains in B . At the end of the preceding proof we had formulas @D ‡ D@ … 11 − \u0013ˆ and ˆ\u0013 … 11 . All the maps ap- pearing in these formulas take chains in A to chains in A , so they induce quotient maps when we factor out chains in A . These quotient maps automatically satisfy the same two formulas, so the inclusion Cn—A ‡ B–=Cn—A– > Cn—X–=Cn—A– induces an isomorphism on homology. The map Cn—B–=Cn—A \\ B–!Cn—A ‡ B–=Cn—A– induced by inclusion is obviously an isomorphism since both quotient groups are free with basis the singular n simplices in B that do not lie in A . Hence we obtain the desired isomorphism Hn—B; A \\ B– ˇ Hn—X; A– induced by inclusion. tu All that remains in the proof of Theorem 2.13 is to replace relative homology groups with absolute homology groups. This is achieved by the following result. Proposition 2.22. For good pairs —X; A– , the quotient map q : —X; A–!—X=A; A=A– induces isomorphisms q\u0003 : Hn—X; A–!Hn—X=A; A=A– ˇ eHn—X=A– for all n . Proof: Let V be a neighborhood of A in X that deformation retracts onto A .We have a commutative diagram A¡¡¡¡¡!XHn(), ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! q¤ V¡¡¡¡¡!XHn(), q¤ V¡¡¡¡¡!XAHn(), q¤ - A- AX/ AA/Hn(), AX/ AX/ AA/ AA/AV/ AV/Hn(),¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! Hn(),-- The upper left horizontal map is an isomorphism since in the long exact sequence of the triple —X;V ;A– the groups Hn—V ; A– are zero for all n , because a deformation retraction of V onto A gives a homotopy equivalence of pairs —V ; A– ' —A; A– , and Hn—A; A– … 0 . The deformation retraction of V onto A induces a deformation retrac- tion of V=A onto A=A , so the same argument shows that the lower left horizontal map is an isomorphism as well. The other two horizontal maps are isomorphisms directly from excision. The right-hand vertical map q\u0003 is an isomorphism since q restricts to a homeomorphism on the complement of A . From the commutativity of the diagram it follows that the left-hand q\u0003 is an isomorphism. tu This proposition shows that relative homology can be expressed as reduced abso- lute homology in the case of good pairs —X; A– , but in fact there is a way of doing this for arbitrary pairs. Consider the space X [ CA where CA is the cone —A\u0002 I–=—A\u0002f0g– Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 125 whose base A\u0002f1g we identify with A ˆ X . Using terminology p CA X A introduced in Chapter 0, X [CA can also be described as the map- ping cone of the inclusion A > X . The assertion is that Hn—X; A– is isomorphic to eHn—X [ CA– for all n via the sequence of iso- morphisms eHn—X [ CA– ˇ Hn—X [ CA; CA– ˇ Hn—X [ CA −fpg;CA −fpg– ˇ Hn—X; A– where p 2 CA is the tip of the cone. The ﬁrst isomorphism comes from the exact sequence of the pair, using the fact that CA is contractible. The second isomorphism is excision, and the third isomorphism comes from the deformation retraction of CA −fpg onto A . Here is an application of the preceding proposition: Example 2.23. Let us ﬁnd explicit cycles representing generators of the inﬁnite cyclic groups Hn—Dn;@Dn– and eHn—S n– . Replacing —Dn;@Dn– by the equivalent pair —Ñn;@Ñ n– , we will show by induction on n that the identity map in : Ñ n!Ñ n , viewed as a singular n simplex, is a cycle generating Hn—Ñ n;@Ñ n– . That it is a cycle is clear since we are considering relative homology. When n … 0 it certainly represents a generator. For the induction step, let Ó ˆ Ñn be the union of all but one of the —n − 1– dimensional faces of Ñ n . Then we claim there are isomorphisms Hn—Ñ n;@Ñ n– ˇ------------! Hn−1—@Ñ n; Ó– ˇ ------------- Hn−1—Ñ n−1;@Ñ n−1– The ﬁrst isomorphism is a boundary map in the long exact sequence of the triple —Ñn;@Ñ n; Ó– , whose third terms Hi—Ñ n; Ó– are zero since Ñ n deformation retracts onto Ó , hence —Ñn; Ó– ' —Ó; Ó– . The second isomorphism comes from the preceding proposition since we are dealing with good pairs and the inclusion Ñ n−1 > @Ñ n as the face not contained in Ó induces a homeomorphism of quotients Ñ n−1=@Ñ n−1 ˇ @Ñn=Ó . The induction step then follows since the cycle in is sent under the ﬁrst isomorphism to the cycle @in which equals \u0006in−1 in Cn−1—@Ñ n; Ó– . To ﬁnd a cycle generating eHn—S n– let us regard S n as two n simplices Ñ n 1 and Ñn 2 with their boundaries identiﬁed in the obvious way, preserving the ordering of vertices. The difference Ñn 1 − Ñ n 2 , viewed as a singular n chain, is then a cycle, and we claim it represents a generator of eHn—S n– , assuming n> 0 so that the latter group is inﬁnite cyclic. To see this, consider the isomorphisms eHn—S n– ˇ------------! Hn—S n; Ñ n 2 – ˇ ------------- Hn—Ñ n 1 ;@Ñ n 1 – where the ﬁrst isomorphism comes from the long exact sequence of the pair —S n; Ñ n 2 – and the second isomorphism is justiﬁed by passing to quotients as before. Under these isomorphisms the cycle Ñn 1 − Ñ n 2 in the ﬁrst group corresponds to the cycle Ñ n 1 in the third group, which represents a generator of this group as we have seen, so Ñ n 1 − Ñn 2 represents a generator of eHn—S n– . 126 Chapter 2 Homology The preceding proposition implies that the excision property holds also for sub- complexes of CW complexes: Corollary 2.24. If the CW complex X is the union of subcomplexes A and B , then the inclusion —B; A \\ B–> —X; A– induces isomorphisms Hn—B; A \\ B–!Hn—X; A– for all n . Proof: Since CW pairs are good, Proposition 2.22 allows us to pass to the quotient spaces B=—A \\ B– and X=A which are homeomorphic, assuming we are not in the trivial case A \\ B …; . tu Here is another application of the preceding proposition: Corollary 2.25. For a wedge sum W \u000b X\u000b , the inclusions i\u000b : X\u000b>W \u000b X\u000b induce an iso- morphism L \u000b i\u000b\u0003 : L \u000b eHn—X\u000b–! eHn—W \u000b X\u000b– , provided that the wedge sum is formed at basepoints x\u000b 2 X\u000b such that the pairs —X\u000b;x\u000b– are good. Proof: Since reduced homology is the same as homology relative to a basepoint, this follows from the proposition by taking —X; A– … —` \u000bX\u000b; ` \u000bfx\u000bg– . tu Here is an application of the machinery we have developed, a classical result of Brouwer from around 1910 known as ‘invariance of dimension,’ which says in partic- ular that Rm is not homeomorphic to R n if m ﬂ n . Theorem 2.26. If nonempty open sets U ˆ R m and V ˆ R n are homeomorphic, then m … n . Proof: For x 2 U we have Hk—U; U −fxg– ˇ Hk—R m; R m −fxg– by excision. From the long exact sequence for the pair —R m; R m −fxg– we get Hk—R m; R m −fxg– ˇ eHk−1—R m −fxg– . Since R m −fxg deformation retracts onto a sphere S m−1 , we con- clude that Hk—U; U −fxg– is Z for k … m and 0 otherwise. By the same reasoning, Hk—V ; V −fyg– is Z for k … n and 0 otherwise. Since a homeomorphism h : U!V induces isomorphisms Hk—U; U −fxg–!Hk—V ; V −fh—x–g– for all k , we must have m … n . tu Generalizing the idea of this proof, the local homology groups of a space X at a point x 2 X are deﬁned to be the groups Hn—X; X −fxg– . For any open neigh- borhood U of x , excision gives isomorphisms Hn—X; X −fxg– ˇ Hn—U; U −fxg– , so these groups depend only on the local topology of X near x . A homeomorphism f : X!Y must induce isomorphisms Hn—X; X −fxg– ˇ Hn—Y ; Y −ff—x–g– for all x and n , so these local homology groups can be used to tell when spaces are not locally homeomorphic at certain points, as in the preceding proof. The exercises give some further examples of this. Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 127 Naturality The exact sequences we have been constructing have an extra property that will become important later at key points in many arguments, though at ﬁrst glance this property may seem just an idle technicality, not very interesting. We shall discuss the property now rather than interrupting later arguments to check it when it is needed, but the reader may prefer to postpone a careful reading of this discussion. The property is called naturality. For example, to say that the long exact sequence of a pair is natural means that for a map f : —X; A–!—Y ; B– , the diagram f -n 1 -n 1 @ @ ... ... ... ...¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ij AAH ()¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!XHnnn ()XH () , ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! ij BBH () YHnnn AH () BH ()()YH () , ¤ ¤¤ ¤ ¤ f¤ f¤ f¤ is commutative. Commutativity of the squares involving i\u0003 and j\u0003 follows from the obvious commutativity of the corresponding squares of chain groups, with Cn in place of Hn . For the other square, when we deﬁned induced homomorphisms we saw that f]@ … @f] at the chain level. Then for a class ƒ\u000b⁄ 2 Hn—X; A– represented by a relative cycle \u000b , we have f\u0003@ƒ\u000b⁄ … f\u0003ƒ@\u000b⁄ … ƒf]@\u000b⁄ … ƒ@f]\u000b⁄ … @ƒf]\u000b⁄ … @f\u0003ƒ\u000b⁄ . Alternatively, we could appeal to the general algebraic fact that the long exact sequence of homology groups associated to a short exact sequence of chain complexes is natural: For a commutative diagram of short exact sequences of chain complexes ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! -B n 1+ B n 1B n... ...¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! -Cn 1+¡¡¡¡¡!Cn 1Cn... ... ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ii i -A n 1+ A n 1A 000 0 00 n... ...¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! jj j -Bn 1+¡¡¡¡¡!Bn 1Bn... ...¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!-Cn 1+¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!

Commutativity of the ﬁrst two squares is obvious since \fi … i 0\u000b implies \f\u0003i\u0003 … i 0 \u0003\u000b\u0003 and γj … j0\f implies γ\u0003j\u0003 … j0 \u0003\f\u0003 . For the third square, recall that the map @ : Hn—C–!Hn−1—A– was deﬁned by @ƒc⁄ … ƒa⁄ where c … j—b– and i—a– … @b .

The Equivalence of Simplicial and Singular Homology We can use the preceding results to show that the simplicial and singular homol- ogy groups of Ñ complexes are always isomorphic. For the proof it will be convenient to consider the relative case as well, so let X be a Ñ complex with A ˆ X a sub- complex. Thus A is the Ñ complex formed by any union of simplices of X . Relative groups HÑ n—X; A– can be deﬁned in the same way as for singular homology, via relative chains Ñn—X; A– … Ñn—X–=Ñn—A– , and this yields a long exact sequence of simplicial homology groups for the pair —X; A– by the same algebraic argument as for singular homology. There is a canonical homomorphism HÑ n—X; A–!Hn—X; A– induced by the chain map Ñn—X; A–!Cn—X; A– sending each n simplex of X to its characteristic map ˙ : Ñn!X . The possibility A …; is not excluded, in which case the relative groups reduce to absolute groups. Theorem 2.27. The homomorphisms HÑ n—X; A–!Hn—X; A– are isomorphisms for all n and all Ñ complex pairs —X; A– . Proof: First we do the case that X is ﬁnite-dimensional and A is empty. For Xk the k skeleton of X , consisting of all simplices of dimension k or less, we have a commutative diagram of exact sequences: H ()n¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!XH ()n k -XXH (),n k 1k-X k 1 H () - X k 1 H ()n 1+ -XX, k 1k -n 1 H ()n¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!XH ()n k -XXH (),n k 1k-X k 1 H () - X k 1 H ()n 1+ -XX, k 1k -n 1¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡! ƒƒ ƒƒƒ Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 129 Let us ﬁrst show that the ﬁrst and fourth vertical maps are isomorphisms for all n . The simplicial chain group Ñn—Xk;Xk−1– is zero for n ﬂ k , and is free abelian with basis the k simplices of X when n … k . Hence HÑ n—Xk;Xk−1– has exactly the same description. The corresponding singular homology groups Hn—Xk;Xk−1– can be com- puted by considering the map Ø : ` \u000b—Ñ k \u000b;@Ñ k \u000b–!—Xk;Xk−1– formed by the character- istic maps Ñk!X for all the k simplices of X . Since Ø induces a homeomorphism of quotient spaces ` \u000bÑk \u000b= ` \u000b@Ñ k \u000b ˇ Xk=Xk−1 , it induces isomorphisms on all singu- lar homology groups. Thus Hn—Xk;Xk−1– is zero for n ﬂ k , while for n … k this group is free abelian with basis represented by the relative cycles given by the char- acteristic maps of all the k simplices of X , in view of the fact that Hk—Ñ k;@Ñ k– is generated by the identity map Ñk!Ñk , as we showed in Example 2.23. Therefore the map HÑ k —Xk;Xk−1–!Hk—Xk;Xk−1– is an isomorphism. By induction on k we may assume the second and ﬁfth vertical maps in the pre- ceding diagram are isomorphisms as well. The following frequently quoted basic alge- braic lemma will then imply that the middle vertical map is an isomorphism, ﬁnishing the proof when X is ﬁnite-dimensional and A …; . The Five-Lemma. In a commutative diagram of abelian groups as at the right, if the two rows A ® ¯ °¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!B¡¡¡¡! C¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! AB¡¡¡¡! C¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! i i j j0 00 00 ± \"¡¡¡¡!DE¡¡¡¡! DE¡¡¡¡! ` ` 0 k k0 00are exact and \u000b , \f , \u000e , and \" are isomorphisms, then γ is an isomorphism also. Proof: It sufﬁces to show: (a) γ is surjective if \f and \u000e are surjective and \" is injective. (b) γ is injective if \f and \u000e are injective and \u000b is surjective. The proofs of these two statements are straightforward diagram chasing. There is really no choice about how the argument can proceed, and it would be a good exercise for the reader to close the book now and reconstruct the proofs without looking. To prove (a), start with an element c0 2 C 0 . Then k 0—c0– … \u000e—d– for some d 2 D since \u000e is surjective. Since \" is injective and \"`—d– … `0\u000e—d– … `0k 0—c0– … 0, we deduce that `—d– … 0 , hence d … k—c– for some c 2 C by exactness of the upper row. The difference c0 − γ—c– maps to 0 under k 0 since k 0—c0– − k0γ—c– … k 0—c– − \u000ek—c– … k0—c0– − \u000e—d– … 0 . Therefore c0 − γ—c– … j0—b0– for some b0 2 B0 by exactness. Since \f is surjective, b0 … \f—b– for some b 2 B , and then γ—c ‡ j—b–– … γ—c– ‡ γj—b– … γ—c– ‡ j0\f—b– … γ—c– ‡ j0—b0– … c0 , showing that γ is surjective. To prove (b), suppose that γ—c– … 0 . Since \u000e is injective, \u000ek—c– … k 0γ—c– … 0 implies k—c– … 0, so c … j—b– for some b 2 B . The element \f—b– satisﬁes j0\f—b– … γj—b– … γ—c– … 0, so \f—b– … i 0—a 0– for some a 0 2 A 0 . Since \u000b is surjective, a 0 … \u000b—a– for some a 2 A . Since \f is injective, \f—i—a– − b– … \fi—a– − \f—b– … i0\u000b—a– − \f—b– … i0—a 0–−\f—b– … 0 implies i—a–−b … 0 . Thus b … i—a– , and hence c … j—b– … ji—a– … 0 since ji … 0 . This shows γ has trivial kernel. tu 130 Chapter 2 Homology Returning to the proof of the theorem, we next consider the case that X is inﬁnite- dimensional, where we will use the following fact: A compact set in X can meet only ﬁnitely many open simplices of X , that is, simplices with their proper faces deleted. This is a general fact about CW complexes proved in the Appendix, but here is a direct proof for Ñ complexes. If a compact set C intersected inﬁnitely many open simplices, it would contain an inﬁnite sequence of points xi each lying in a different open simplex. Then the sets Ui … X − S jﬂifxjg , which are open since their preimages under the characteristic maps of all the simplices are clearly open, form an open cover of C with no ﬁnite subcover. This can be applied to show the map HÑ n—X–!Hn—X– is surjective. Represent a given element of Hn—X– by a singular n cycle z . This is a linear combination of ﬁnitely many singular simplices with compact images, meeting only ﬁnitely many open sim- plices of X , hence contained in Xk for some k . We have shown that HÑ n—Xk–!Hn—Xk– is an isomorphism, in particular surjective, so z is homologous in Xk (hence in X )to a simplicial cycle. This gives surjectivity. Injectivity is similar: If a simplicial n cycle z is the boundary of a singular chain in X , this chain has compact image and hence must lie in some Xk ,so z represents an element of the kernel of HÑ n—Xk–!Hn—Xk– . But we know this map is injective, so z is a simplicial boundary in Xk , and therefore in X . It remains to do the case of arbitrary X with A ﬂ ; , but this follows from the absolute case by applying the ﬁve-lemma to the canonical map from the long exact sequence of simplicial homology groups for the pair —X; A– to the corresponding long exact sequence of singular homology groups. tu We can deduce from this theorem that Hn—X– is ﬁnitely generated whenever X is a Ñ complex with ﬁnitely many n simplices, since in this case the simplicial chain group Ñn—X– is ﬁnitely generated, hence also its subgroup of cycles and therefore also the latter group’s quotient HÑ n—X– . If we write Hn—X– as the direct sum of cyclic groups, then the number of Z summands is known traditionally as the n th Betti number of X , and integers specifying the orders of the ﬁnite cyclic summands are called torsion coefﬁcients. It is a curious historical fact that homology was not thought of originally as a sequence of groups, but rather as Betti numbers and torsion coefﬁcients. One can after all compute Betti numbers and torsion coefﬁcients from the simplicial boundary maps without actually mentioning homology groups. This computational viewpoint, with homology being numbers rather than groups, prevailed from when Poincar´e ﬁrst started serious work on homology around 1900, up until the 1920s when the more abstract viewpoint of groups entered the picture. During this period ‘homology’ meant primarily ‘simplicial homology,’ and it was another 20 years before the shift to singular homology was complete, with the ﬁnal deﬁnition of singular homology emerging only Simplicial and Singular Homology Section 2.1 131 in a 1944 paper of Eilenberg, after contributions from quite a few others, particularly Alexander and Lefschetz. Within the next few years the rest of the basic structure of homology theory as we have presented it fell into place, and the ﬁrst deﬁnitive treatment appeared in the classic book [Eilenberg & Steenrod 1952].

This can be done with short exact sequences in which all the groups are either Z or 0 . 134 Chapter 2 Homology Now that the basic properties of homology have been established, we can begin to move a little more freely. Our ﬁrst topic, exploiting the calculation of Hn—S n– ,is Brouwer’s notion of degree for maps S n!S n . Historically, Brouwer’s introduction of this concept in the years 1910–12 preceded the rigorous development of homology, so his deﬁnition was rather different, using the technique of simplicial approximation which we explain in x2.C. The later deﬁnition in terms of homology is certainly more elegant, though perhaps with some loss of geometric intuition. More in the spirit of Brouwer’s deﬁnition is a third approach using differential topology, presented very lucidly in [Milnor 1965]. Degree For a map f : S n!S n with n> 0 , the induced map f\u0003 : Hn—S n–!Hn—S n– is a homomorphism from an inﬁnite cyclic group to itself and so must be of the form f\u0003—\u000b– … d\u000b for some integer d depending only on f . This integer is called the degree of f , with the notation deg f . Here are some basic properties of degree: (a) deg 11 … 1 , since 11\u0003 … 11. (b) deg f … 0if f is not surjective. For if we choose a point x0 2 S n − f—S n– then f can be factored as a composition S n!S n −fx0g > S n and Hn—S n −fx0g– … 0 since S n −fx0g is contractible. Hence f\u0003 … 0. (c) If f ' g then deg f … deg g since f\u0003 … g\u0003 . The converse statement, that f ' g if deg f … deg g , is a fundamental theorem of Hopf from around 1925 which we prove in Corollary 4.25. (d) deg fg … deg f deg g , since —f g–\u0003 … f\u0003g\u0003 . As a consequence, deg f …\u00061if f is a homotopy equivalence since fg ' 11 implies deg f deg g … deg 11 … 1. (e) deg f …−1if f is a reﬂection of S n , ﬁxing the points in a subsphere S n−1 and interchanging the two complementary hemispheres. For we can give S n a Ñ complex structure with these two hemispheres as its two n simplices Ñ n 1 and Ñn 2 , and the n chain Ñn 1 − Ñ n 2 represents a generator of Hn—S n– as we saw in Example 2.23, so the reﬂection interchanging Ñn 1 and Ñ n 2 sends this generator to its negative. (f) The antipodal map −11: S n!S n , x , −x , has degree —−1– n‡1 since it is the composition of n ‡ 1 reﬂections, each changing the sign of one coordinate in Rn‡1 . (g) If f : S n!S n has no ﬁxed points then deg f … —−1– n‡1 . For if f—x– ﬂ x then the line segment from f—x– to −x , deﬁned by t , —1 − t–f —x– − tx for 0 \u0014 t \u0014 1, does not pass through the origin. Hence if f has no ﬁxed points, the formula ft—x– … ƒ—1 − t–f —x– − tx⁄=j—1 − t–f —x– − txj deﬁnes a homotopy from f to Computations and Applications Section 2.2 135 the antipodal map. Note that the antipodal map has no ﬁxed points, so the fact that maps without ﬁxed points are homotopic to the antipodal map is a sort of converse statement. Here is an interesting application of degree: Theorem 2.28. S n has a continuous ﬁeld of nonzero tangent vectors iff n is odd. Proof: Suppose x , v—x– is a tangent vector ﬁeld on S n , assigning to a vector x 2 S n the vector v—x– tangent to S n at x . Regarding v—x– as a vector at the origin instead of at x , tangency just means that x and v—x– are orthogonal in R n‡1 .If v—x– ﬂ 0 for all x , we may normalize so that jv—x–j… 1 for all x by replacing v—x– by v—x–=jv—x–j . Assuming this has been done, the vectors —cos t–x ‡ —sin t–v—x– lie in the unit circle in the plane spanned by x and v—x– . Letting t go from 0 to ˇ ,we obtain a homotopy ft—x– … —cos t–x ‡ —sin t–v—x– from the identity map of Sn to the antipodal map −11 . This implies that deg—−11– … deg 11 , hence —−1– n‡1 … 1 and n must be odd. Conversely, if n is odd, say n … 2k − 1 , we can deﬁne v—x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x2k−1;x2k– … —−x2;x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; −x2k;x2k−1– . Then v—x– is orthogonal to x ,so v is a tangent vector ﬁeld on S n , and jv—x–j… 1 for all x 2 S n . tu For the much more difﬁcult problem of ﬁnding the maximum number of tan- gent vector ﬁelds on S n that are linearly independent at each point, see [VBKT] or [Husemoller 1966]. Another nice application of degree, giving a partial answer to a question raised in Example 1.43, is the following result: Proposition 2.29. Z2 is the only nontrivial group that can act freely on S n if n is even. Recall that an action of a group G on a space X is a homomorphism from G to the group Homeo—X– of homeomorphisms X!X , and the action is free if the homeomorphism corresponding to each nontrivial element of G has no ﬁxed points. In the case of S n , the antipodal map x , −x generates a free action of Z2 . Proof: Since the degree of a homeomorphism must be \u00061 , an action of a group G on S n determines a degree function d : G!f\u00061g . This is a homomorphism since deg fg … deg f deg g . If the action is free, then d sends every nontrivial element of G to —−1–n‡1 by property (g) above. Thus when n is even, d has trivial kernel, so G ˆ Z2 . tu Next we describe a technique for computing degrees which can be applied to most maps that arise in practice. Suppose f : S n!S n , n> 0 , has the property that for 136 Chapter 2 Homology some point y 2 S n , the preimage f −1—y– consists of only ﬁnitely many points, say x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xm . Let U1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;Um be disjoint neighborhoods of these points, mapped by f into a neighborhood V of y . Then f—Ui − xi– ˆ V − y for each i , and we have a commutative diagram ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!n SH () f j k ¤ f¤ ¡¡¡¡¡! f¤ n Sy n ¼ ¼ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! H () n SH ()S nn n ¼ ¼ , -n SH () n Sx n, - n VH ()Vy, -ni i pi i i iUH ()Ux, - n SH ( ()) n Syf n, - - 1 where all the maps are the obvious ones, in particular ki and pi are induced by inclu- sions. The two isomorphisms in the upper half of the diagram come from excision, while the lower two isomorphisms come from exact sequences of pairs. Via these four isomorphisms, the top two groups in the diagram can be identiﬁed with Hn—S n– ˇ Z , and the top homomorphism f\u0003 becomes multiplication by an integer called the local degree of f at xi , written deg f jj xi . For example, if f is a homeomorphism, then y can be any point and there is only one corresponding xi , so all the maps in the diagram are isomorphisms and deg f jj xi … deg f …\u00061 . More generally, if f maps each Ui homeomorphically onto V , then deg f jj xi …\u00061 for each i . This situation occurs quite often in applications, and it is usually not hard to determine the correct signs. Here is the formula that reduces degree calculations to computing local degrees: Proposition 2.30. deg f … P i deg f jj xi . Proof: By excision, the central term Hn( S n;S n − f −1—y–\u0001 in the preceding diagram is the direct sum of the groups Hn—Ui;Ui − xi– ˇ Z , with ki the inclusion of the i th summand. Since the upper triangle commutes, the projections of this direct sum onto its summands are given by the maps pi . Identifying the outer groups in the diagram with Z as before, commutativity of the lower triangle says that pij—1– … 1, hence j—1– … —1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 1– … Pi ki—1– . Commutativity of the upper square says that the middle f\u0003 takes ki—1– to deg f jj xi , hence P i ki—1– … j—1– is taken to Pi deg f jj xi . Commutativity of the lower square then gives the formula deg f … P i deg f jj xi . tu Example 2.31. We can use this result to construct a map S n!S n of any given degree, for each n \u0015 1 . Let q : S n!W k S n be the quotient map obtained by collapsing the complement of k disjoint open balls Bi in S n to a point, and let p : W k S n!S n identify all the summands to a single sphere. Consider the composition f … pq . For almost all y 2 S n we have f −1—y– consisting of one point xi in each Bi . The local degree of f at xi is \u00061 since f is a homeomorphism near xi . By precomposing p with reﬂections of the summands of W k S n if necessary, we can make each local degree either ‡1or −1 , whichever we wish. Thus we can produce a map S n!S n of degree \u0006k . Computations and Applications Section 2.2 137 Example 2.32. In the case of S 1 , the map f—z– … zk , where we view S 1 as the unit circle in C , has degree k . This is evident in the case k … 0 since f is then constant. The case k< 0 reduces to the case k> 0 by composing with z , z−1 , which is a reﬂection, of degree −1 . To compute the degree when k> 0 , observe ﬁrst that for any y 2 S 1 , f −1—y– consists of k points x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xk near each of which f is a local homeomorphism, stretching a circular arc by a factor of k . This local stretching can be eliminated by a deformation of f near xi that does not change local degree, so the local degree at xi is the same as for a rotation of S 1 . A rotation is a homeomorphism so its local degree at any point equals its global degree, which is ‡1 since a rotation is homotopic to the identity. Hence deg f jj xi … 1 and deg f … k . Another way of obtaining a map S n!S n of degree k is to take a repeated sus- pension of the map z , zk in Example 2.32, since suspension preserves degree: Proposition 2.33. deg Sf … deg f , where Sf : S n‡1!S n‡1 is the suspension of the map f : S n!S n . Proof: Let CS n denote the cone —S n \u0002 I–=—S n \u0002 1– with base S n … S n \u0002 0 ˆ CS n , so CS n=S n is the suspension of S n . The map f induces Cf : —CS n;S n–!—CS n;S n– with quotient Sf . The naturality of the boundary maps Sf¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!H () n SH () ¤ f¤ »» S n 1 n+ n 1+ @ ¼ ¡¡¡¡¡!H () n SH () »» S n 1 n+ n 1+ @ ¼ in the long exact sequence of the pair —CS n;S n– then gives commutativity of the diagram at the right. Hence if f\u0003 is multiplication by d ,sois Sf\u0003 . tu Note that for f : S n!S n , the suspension Sf maps only one point to each of the two ‘poles’ of S n‡1 . This implies that the local degree of Sf at each pole must equal the global degree of Sf . Thus the local degree of a map S n!S n can be any integer if n \u0015 2 , just as the degree itself can be any integer when n \u0015 1. Cellular Homology Cellular homology is a very efﬁcient tool for computing the homology groups of CW complexes, based on degree calculations. Before giving the deﬁnition of cellular homology, we ﬁrst establish a few preliminary facts: Lemma 2.34. If X is a CW complex, then : (a) Hk—Xn;Xn−1– is zero for k ﬂ n and is free abelian for k … n , with a basis in one-to-one correspondence with the n cells of X . (b) Hk—Xn– … 0 for k>n . In particular, if X is ﬁnite-dimensional then Hk—X– … 0 for k> dim X . (c) The inclusion i : Xn > X induces an isomorphism i\u0003 : Hk—Xn–!Hk—X– if k<n . Proof: Statement (a) follows immediately from the observation that —Xn;Xn−1– is a good pair and Xn=Xn−1 is a wedge sum of n spheres, one for each n cell of X . Here we are using Proposition 2.22 and Corollary 2.25. 138 Chapter 2 Homology To prove (b), consider the long exact sequence of the pair —Xn;Xn−1– , which contains the segments Hk‡1—Xn;Xn−1– -! Hk—Xn−1– -! Hk—Xn– -! Hk—Xn;Xn−1– If k is not equal to n or n − 1 then the outer two groups are zero by part (a), so we have isomorphisms Hk—Xn−1– ˇ Hk—Xn– for k ﬂ n; n − 1 . Thus if k>n we have Hk—Xn– ˇ Hk—Xn−1– ˇ Hk—Xn−2– ˇ\u0001\u0001\u0001 ˇ Hk—X0– … 0 , proving (b). Further, if k<n then Hk—Xn– ˇ Hk—Xn‡1– ˇ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ˇ Hk—Xn‡m– for all m \u0015 0 , proving (c) if X is ﬁnite-dimensional. The proof of (c) when X is inﬁnite-dimensional requires more work, and this can be done in two different ways. The more direct approach is to descend to the chain level and use the fact that a singular chain in X has compact image, hence meets only ﬁnitely many cells of X by Proposition A.1 in the Appendix. Thus each chain lies in a ﬁnite skeleton Xm .So a k cycle in X is a cycle in some Xm , and then by the ﬁnite-dimensional case of (c), the cycle is homologous to a cycle in Xn if n>k ,so i\u0003 : Hk—Xn–!Hk—X– is surjective. Similarly for injectivity, if a k cycle in Xn bounds a chain in X , this chain lies in some Xm with m \u0015 n , so by the ﬁnite-dimensional case the cycle bounds a chain in Xn if n>k . The other approach is more general. From the long exact sequence of the pair —X; Xn– it sufﬁces to show Hk—X; Xn– … 0 for k \u0014 n . Since Hk—X; Xn– ˇ eHk—X=Xn– , this reduces the problem to showing: —\u0003– eHk—X– … 0 for k \u0014 n if the n skeleton of X is a point. When X is ﬁnite-dimensional, —\u0003– is immediate from the ﬁnite-dimensional case of (c) which we have already shown. It will sufﬁce therefore to reduce the inﬁnite- dimensional case to the ﬁnite-dimensional case. This reduction will be achieved by stretching X out to a complex that is at least locally ﬁnite-dimensional, using a special case of the ‘mapping telescope’ construction described in greater generality in x3.F. R Consider X \u0002 ƒ0; 1– with its product cell structure, where we give ƒ0; 1– the cell structure with the integer points as 0 cells. Let T … S i Xi \u0002 ƒi; 1– , a subcomplex of X \u0002 ƒ0; 1– . The ﬁgure shows a schematic picture of T with ƒ0; 1– in the hor- izontal direction and the subcomplexes Xi \u0002 ƒi; i ‡ 1⁄ as rectangles whose size in- creases with i since Xi ˆ Xi‡1 . The line labeled R can be ignored for now. We claim that T ' X , hence Hk—X– ˇ Hk—T – for all k . Since X is a deformation retract of X \u0002 ƒ0; 1– , it sufﬁces to show that X \u0002 ƒ0; 1– also deformation retracts onto T . Let Yi … T [( X \u0002 ƒi; 1–\u0001 . Then Yi deformation retracts onto Yi‡1 since X \u0002 ƒi; i‡1⁄ defor- mation retracts onto Xi \u0002 ƒi; i ‡ 1⁄ [ X \u0002fi ‡ 1g by Proposition 0.16. If we perform the deformation retraction of Yi onto Yi‡1 during the t interval ƒ1 − 1=2 i; 1 − 1=2 i‡1⁄ , then this gives a deformation retraction ft of X \u0002 ƒ0; 1– onto T , with points in Xi \u0002 ƒ0; 1– stationary under ft for t \u0015 1 − 1=2 i‡1 . Continuity follows from the fact Computations and Applications Section 2.2 139 that CW complexes have the weak topology with respect to their skeleta, so a map is continuous if its restriction to each skeleton is continuous. Recalling that X0 is a point, let R ˆ T be the ray X0 \u0002 ƒ0; 1– and let Z ˆ T be the union of this ray with all the subcomplexes Xi \u0002fig . Then Z=R is homeomorphic to W i Xi , a wedge sum of ﬁnite-dimensional complexes with n skeleton a point, so the ﬁnite-dimensional case of —\u0003– together with Corollary 2.25 describing the homology of wedge sums implies that eHk—Z=R– … 0 for k \u0014 n . The same is therefore true for Z , from the long exact sequence of the pair —Z; R– , since R is contractible. Similarly, T=Z is a wedge sum of ﬁnite-dimensional complexes with —n ‡ 1– skeleton a point, since if we ﬁrst collapse each subcomplex Xi \u0002fig of T to a point, we obtain the inﬁnite sequence of suspensions SXi ‘skewered’ along the ray R , and then if we collapse R to a point we obtain W i ÖXi where ÖXi is the reduced suspension of Xi , obtained from SXi by collapsing the line segment X0 \u0002 ƒi; i‡1⁄ to a point, so ÖXi has —n‡1– skeleton a point. Thus eHk—T =Z– … 0 for k \u0014 n ‡ 1 , and then the long exact sequence of the pair —T ; Z– implies that eHk—T – … 0 for k \u0014 n , and we have proved —\u0003– . tu Let X be a CW complex. Using Lemma 2.34, portions of the long exact sequences for the pairs —Xn‡1;Xn– , —Xn;Xn−1– , and —Xn−1;Xn−2– ﬁt into a diagram - - XXH (),n 1+ n 1 n+ n 1+ n 1+ n 1+ ¡¡¡¡¡!

The composition dndn‡1 includes two successive maps in one of the exact sequences, hence is zero. Thus the horizontal row in the diagram is a chain complex, called the cellular chain complex of X since Hn—Xn;Xn−1– is free with basis in one-to-one correspondence with the n cells of X , so one can think of elements of Hn—Xn;Xn−1– as linear combinations of n cells of X . The homology groups of this cellular chain complex are called the cellular homology groups of X . Temporarily we denote them HCW n —X– . Theorem 2.35. HCW n —X– ˇ Hn—X– . Proof: From the diagram above, Hn—X– can be identiﬁed with Hn—Xn–= Im @n‡1 . Since jn is injective, it maps Im @n‡1 isomorphically onto Im—jn@n‡1– … Im dn‡1 140 Chapter 2 Homology and Hn—Xn– isomorphically onto Im jn … Ker @n . Since jn−1 is injective, Ker @n … Ker dn . Thus jn induces an isomorphism of the quotient Hn—Xn–= Im @n‡1 onto Ker dn= Im dn‡1 . tu Here are a few immediate applications: (i) Hn—X– … 0if X is a CW complex with no n cells. (ii) More generally, if X is a CW complex with kn cells, then Hn—X– is generated by at most k elements. For since Hn—Xn;Xn−1– is free abelian on k generators, the subgroup Ker dn must be generated by at most k elements, hence also the quotient Ker dn= Im dn‡1 . (iii) If X is a CW complex having no two of its cells in adjacent dimensions, then Hn—X– is free abelian with basis in one-to-one correspondence with the n cells of X . This is because the cellular boundary maps dn are automatically zero in this case. This last observation applies for example to CPn , which has a CW structure with one cell of each even dimension 2k \u0014 2n as we saw in Example 0.6. Thus Hi—CPn– ˇ ˆ Z for i … 0; 2; 4; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 2n 0 otherwise Another simple example is Sn \u0002 S n with n> 1 , using the product CW structure con- sisting of a 0 cell, two n cells, and a 2n cell. It is possible to prove the statements (i)–(iii) for ﬁnite-dimensional CW complexes by induction on the dimension, without using cellular homology but only the basic results from the previous section. However, the viewpoint of cellular homology makes (i)–(iii) quite transparent. Next we describe how the cellular boundary maps dn can be computed. When n … 1 this is easy since the boundary map d1 : H1—X1;X0–!H0—X0– is the same as the simplicial boundary map Ñ1—X–!Ñ0—X– . In case X is connected and has only one 0 cell, then d1 must be 0 , otherwise H0—X– would not be Z . When n> 1 we will show that dn can be computed in terms of degrees: Cellular Boundary Formula. dn—en \u000b– … P \f d\u000b\fen−1 \f where d\u000b\f is the degree of the map S n−1 \u000b !Xn−1!S n−1 \f that is the composition of the attaching map of en \u000b with the quotient map collapsing Xn−1 − en−1 \f to a point. Here we are identifying the cells en \u000b and en−1 \f with generators of the corresponding summands of the cellular chain groups. The summation in the formula contains only ﬁnitely many terms since the attaching map of en \u000b has compact image, so this image meets only ﬁnitely many cells en−1 \f .

The map Ø\u000b\u0003 takes a chosen generator ƒDn \u000b⁄ 2 Hn—Dn \u000b;@Dn \u000b– to a generator of the Z summand of Hn—Xn;Xn−1– corresponding to en \u000b .

Commutativity of the diagram then yields the formula for dn given above. Example 2.36. Let Mg be the closed orientable surface of genus g with its usual CW structure consisting of one 0 cell, 2g 1 cells, and one 2 cell attached by the product of commutators ƒa1;b1⁄ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ƒag;bg⁄ . The associated cellular chain complex is 0 -----! Z d2------------! Z2g d1------------! Z -----! 0 As observed above, d1 must be 0 since there is only one 0 cell. Also, d2 is 0 because each ai or bi appears with its inverse in ƒa1;b1⁄ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ƒag;bg⁄ , so the maps Ñ\u000b\f are homotopic to constant maps. Since d1 and d2 are both zero, the homology groups of Mg are the same as the cellular chain groups, namely, Z in dimensions 0 and 2 , and Z2g in dimension 1 . Example 2.37. The closed nonorientable surface Ng of genus g has a cell structure with one 0 cell, g 1 cells, and one 2 cell attached by the word a 2 1a 2 2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 a 2 g . Again d1 … 0 , and d2 : Z!Z g is speciﬁed by the equation d2—1– … —2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 2– since each ai appears in the attaching word of the 2 cell with total exponent 2 , which means that each Ñ\u000b\f is homotopic to the map z , z2 , of degree 2 . Since d2—1– … —2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 2– ,we have d2 injective and hence H2—Ng– … 0 . If we change the basis for Z g by replacing the last standard basis element —0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 0; 1– by —1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 1– , we see that H1—Ng– ˇ Zg−1 \b Z2 . 142 Chapter 2 Homology These two examples illustrate the general fact that the orientability of a closed connected manifold M of dimension n is detected by Hn—M– , which is Z if M is orientable and 0 otherwise. This is shown in Theorem 3.26. Example 2.38: An Acyclic Space. Let X be obtained from S1 _ S 1 by attaching two 2 cells by the words a 5b−3 and b3—ab– −2 . Then d2 : Z 2!Z 2 has matrix \u0010 5 −2 −31 \u0011 , with the two columns coming from abelianizing a5b−3 and b3—ab– −2 to 5a − 3b and −2a ‡ b , in additive notation. The matrix has determinant −1, so d2 is an isomorphism and eHi—X– … 0 for all i . Such a space X is called acyclic. We can see that this acyclic space is not contractible by considering ˇ1—X– , which has the presentation a; b jjjj a5b−3;b3—ab– −2 \u000b . There is a nontrivial homomorphism from this group to the group G of rotational symmetries of a regular dodecahedron, sending a to the rotation ˆa through angle 2ˇ=5 about the axis through the center of a pentagonal face, and b to the rotation ˆb through angle 2ˇ=3 about the axis through a vertex of this face. The composition ˆaˆb is a rotation through angle ˇ about the axis through the midpoint of an edge abutting this vertex. Thus the relations a5 … b3 … —ab– 2 deﬁning ˇ1—X– become ˆ5 a … ˆ3 b … —ˆaˆb– 2 … 1in G , which means there is a well-deﬁned homomorphism ˆ : ˇ1—X–!G sending a to ˆa and b to ˆb . It is not hard to see that G is generated by ˆa and ˆb ,so ˆ is surjective. With more work one can compute that the kernel of ˆ is Z2 , generated by the element a5 … b3 … —ab–2 , and this Z2 is in fact the center of ˇ1—X– . In particular, ˇ1—X– has order 120 since G has order 60. After these 2 dimensional examples, let us now move up to three dimensions, where we have the additional task of computing the cellular boundary map d3 . c c cc b b b b a a a a c c cc b b b b a a a a Example 2.39.A 3 dimensional torus T 3 … S 1 \u0002 S 1 \u0002 S 1 can be constructed from a cube by identifying each pair of opposite square faces as in the ﬁrst of the two ﬁgures. The second ﬁgure shows a slightly different pattern of identiﬁcations of opposite faces, with the front and back faces now identiﬁed via a rotation of the cube around a horizontal left-right axis. The space produced by these identiﬁcations is the product K \u0002 S 1 of a Klein bottle and a circle. For both T 3 and K \u0002 S 1 we have a CW structure with one 3 cell, three 2 cells, three 1 cells, and one 0 cell. The cellular chain complexes thus have the form 0 -! Z d3------------! Z 3 d2------------! Z3 0-----! Z -! 0 In the case of the 3 torus T 3 the cellular boundary map d2 is zero by the same calculation as for the 2 dimensional torus. We claim that d3 is zero as well. This amounts to saying that the three maps Ñ\u000b\f : S 2!S 2 corresponding to the three 2 cells Computations and Applications Section 2.2 143 have degree zero. Each Ñ\u000b\f maps the interiors of two opposite faces of the cube homeomorphically onto the complement of a point in the target S 2 and sends the remaining four faces to this point. Computing local degrees at the center points of the two opposite faces, we see that the local degree is ‡1 at one of these points and −1 at the other, since the restrictions of Ñ\u000b\f to these two faces differ by a reﬂection of the boundary of the cube across the plane midway between them, and a reﬂection has degree −1 . Since the cellular boundary maps are all zero, we deduce that Hi—T 3– is Z for i … 0; 3, Z3 for i … 1; 2 , and 0 for i> 3. For K \u0002 S 1 , when we compute local degrees for the front and back faces we ﬁnd that the degrees now have the same rather than opposite signs since the map Ñ\u000b\f on these two faces differs not by a reﬂection but by a rotation of the boundary of the cube. The local degrees for the other faces are the same as before. Using the letters A , B , C to denote the 2 cells given by the faces orthogonal to the edges a , b , c , respectively, we have the boundary formulas d3e3 … 2C , d2A … 2b , d2B … 0 , and d2C … 0. It follows that H3—K \u0002 S 1– … 0, H2—K \u0002 S 1– … Z\b Z2 , and H1—K \u0002 S 1– … Z\b Z\b Z2 . Many more examples of a similar nature, quotients of a cube or other polyhedron with faces identiﬁed in some pattern, could be worked out in similar fashion. But let us instead turn to some higher-dimensional examples. Example 2.40: Moore Spaces. Given an abelian group G and an integer n \u0015 1, we will construct a CW complex X such that Hn—X– ˇ G and eHi—X– … 0 for i ﬂ n . Such a space is called a Moore space, commonly written M—G; n– to indicate the dependence on G and n . It is probably best for the deﬁnition of a Moore space to include the condition that M—G; n– be simply-connected if n> 1 . The spaces we construct will have this property. As an easy special case, when G … Zm we can take X to be S n with a cell en‡1 attached by a map S n!S n of degree m . More generally, any ﬁnitely generated G can be realized by taking wedge sums of examples of this type for ﬁnite cyclic summands of G , together with copies of S n for inﬁnite cyclic summands of G . In the general nonﬁnitely generated case let F!G be a homomorphism of a free abelian group F onto G , sending a basis for F onto some set of generators of G . The kernel K of this homomorphism is a subgroup of a free abelian group, hence is itself free abelian. Choose bases fx\u000bg for F and fy\fg for K , and write y\f … P\u000b d\f\u000bx\u000b . Let Xn … W \u000b S n \u000b ,so Hn—Xn– ˇ F via Corollary 2.25. We will construct X from Xn by attaching cells en‡1 \f via maps f\f : S n!Xn such that the composition of f\f with the projection onto the summand S n \u000b has degree d\f\u000b . Then the cellular boundary map dn‡1 will be the inclusion K > F , hence X will have the desired homology groups. The construction of f\f generalizes the construction in Example 2.31 of a map S n!S n of given degree. Namely, we can let f\f map the complement of P \u000b jd\f\u000bj 144 Chapter 2 Homology disjoint balls in S n to the 0 cell of Xn while sending jd\f\u000bj of the balls onto the summand S n \u000b by maps of degree ‡1if d\f\u000b > 0 , or degree −1if d\f\u000b < 0. Example 2.41. By taking a wedge sum of the Moore spaces constructed in the preced- ing example for varying n we obtain a connected CW complex with any prescribed sequence of homology groups in dimensions 1; 2; 3; \u0001\u0001\u0001 . Example 2.42: Real Projective Space RPn . As we saw in Example 0.4, RPn hasaCW structure with one cell ek in each dimension k \u0014 n , and the attaching map for ek is the 2 sheeted covering projection ' : S k−1!RPk−1 . To compute the boundary map dk we compute the degree of the composition S k−1 ' -----! RPk−1 q -----! RPk−1=RPk−2 … S k−1 , with q the quotient map. The map q' is a homeomorphism when restricted to each component of S k−1 − S k−2 , and these two homeomorphisms are obtained from each other by precomposing with the antipodal map of S k−1 , which has degree —−1– k . Hence deg q' … deg 11 ‡ deg—−11– … 1 ‡ —−1– k , and so dk is either 0 or multiplication by 2 according to whether k is odd or even. Thus the cellular chain complex for RPn is 0 -! Z 2-----! Z 0-----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 2-----! Z 0-----! Z 2-----! Z 0-----! Z -! 0if n is even 0 -! Z 0-----! Z 2-----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 2-----! Z 0-----! Z 2-----! Z 0-----! Z -! 0if n is odd From this it follows that Hk—RPn– … 8 < : Z for k … 0 and for k … n odd Z2 for k odd, 0 <k<n 0 otherwise Example 2.43: Lens Spaces. This example is somewhat more complicated. Given an integer m> 1 and integers `1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`n relatively prime to m , deﬁne the lens space L … Lm—`1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`n– to be the orbit space S 2n−1=Zm of the unit sphere S 2n−1 ˆ C n with the action of Zm generated by the rotation ˆ—z1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn– … —e2ˇi`1=mz1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;e2ˇi`n=mzn– , rotating the j th C factor of C n by the angle 2ˇ`j=m . In particular, when m … 2, ˆ is the antipodal map, so L … RP2n−1 in this case. In the general case, the projection S 2n−1!L is a covering space since the action of Zm on S 2n−1 is free: Only the identity element ﬁxes any point of S 2n−1 since each point of S 2n−1 has some coordinate zj nonzero and then e2ˇ ik`j =mzj ﬂ zj for 0 <k<m , as a result of the assumption that `j is relatively prime to m . We shall construct a CW structure on L with one cell ek for each k \u0014 2n − 1 and show that the resulting cellular chain complex is 0 -! Z 0-----! Z m------------! Z 0-----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 0-----! Z m------------! Z 0-----! Z -! 0 with boundary maps alternately 0 and multiplication by m . Hence Hk( Lm—`1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`n–\u0001 … 8 < : Z for k … 0; 2n − 1 Zm for k odd, 0 <k< 2n − 1 0 otherwise Computations and Applications Section 2.2 145 To obtain the CW structure, ﬁrst subdivide the unit circle C in the nth C factor of Cn by taking the points e2ˇij=m 2 C as vertices, j … 1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;m . Joining the j th vertex of C to the unit sphere S 2n−3 ˆ C n−1 by arcs of great circles in S 2n−1 yields a —2n − 2– dimensional ball B2n−2 j bounded by S 2n−3 . Speciﬁcally, B2n−2 j consists of the points cos \u0012—0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 0;e2ˇij=m–‡sin \u0012—z1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn−1; 0– for 0 \u0014 \u0012 \u0014 ˇ=2 . Similarly, joining the j th edge of C to S 2n−3 gives a ball B2n−1 j bounded by B2n−2 j and B2n−2 j‡1 , subscripts being taken mod m . The rotation ˆ carries S 2n−3 to itself and rotates C by the angle 2ˇ`n=m , hence ˆ permutes the B2n−2 j ’s and the B2n−1 j ’s. A suitable power of ˆ , namely ˆr where r`n \u0011 1 mod m , takes each B2n−2 j and B2n−1 j to the next one. Since ˆr has order m , it is also a generator of the rotation group Zm , and hence we may obtain L as the quotient of one B2n−1 j by identifying its two faces B2n−2 j and B2n−2 j‡1 together via ˆr . In particular, when n … 2, B2n−1 j is a lens-shaped 3 ball and L is obtained from this ball by identifying its two curved disk faces via ˆr , which may be described as the composition of the reﬂection across the plane con- taining the rim of the lens, taking one face of the lens to the other, followed by a rotation of this face through the angle 2ˇ`=m where ` … r`1 . The ﬁgure illustrates the case —m; `– … —7; 2– , with the two dots indicating a typical pair of identiﬁed points in the upper and lower faces of the lens. Since the lens space L is determined by the rota- tion angle 2ˇ`=m , it is conveniently written L`=m . Clearly only the mod m value of ` matters. It is a classical theorem of Reidemeister from the 1930s that L`=m is homeo- morphic to L`0=m0 iff m0 … m and `0 \u0011\u0006`\u00061 mod m . For example, when m … 7 there are only two distinct lens spaces L1=7 and L2=7 . The ‘if’ part of this theorem is easy: Reﬂecting the lens through a mirror shows that L`=m ˇ L−`=m , and by interchanging the roles of the two C factors of C2 one obtains L`=m ˇ L`−1=m . In the converse di- rection, L`=m ˇ L`0=m0 clearly implies m … m0 since ˇ1—L`=m– ˇ Zm . The rest of the theorem takes considerably more work, involving either special 3 dimensional tech- niques or more algebraic methods that generalize to classify the higher-dimensional lens spaces as well. The latter approach is explained in [Cohen 1973]. Returning to the construction of a CW structure on Lm—`1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`n– , observe that the —2n − 3– dimensional lens space Lm—`1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`n−1– sits in Lm—`1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`n– as the quotient of S 2n−3 , and Lm—`1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`n– is obtained from this subspace by attaching two cells, of dimensions 2n − 2 and 2n − 1 , coming from the interiors of B2n−1 j and its two identiﬁed faces B2n−2 j and B2n−2 j‡1 . Inductively this gives a CW structure on Lm—`1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`n– with one cell ek in each dimension k \u0014 2n − 1. The boundary maps in the associated cellular chain complex are computed as follows. The ﬁrst one, d2n−1 , is zero since the identiﬁcation of the two faces of B2n−1 j is via a reﬂection (degree −1 ) across B2n−1 j ﬁxing S 2n−3 , followed by a rota- 146 Chapter 2 Homology tion (degree ‡1), so d2n−1—e2n−1– … e2n−2 − e2n−2 … 0 . The next boundary map d2n−2 takes e2n−2 to me2n−3 since the attaching map for e2n−2 is the quotient map S 2n−3!Lm—`1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`n−1– and the balls B2n−3 j in S 2n−3 which project down onto e2n−3 are permuted cyclically by the rotation ˆ of degree ‡1 . Inductively, the subsequent boundary maps dk then alternate between 0 and multiplication by m . Also of interest are the inﬁnite-dimensional lens spaces Lm—`1;`2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– … S 1=Zm deﬁned in the same way as in the ﬁnite-dimensional case, starting from a sequence of integers `1;`2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 relatively prime to m . The space Lm—`1;`2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– is the union of the increasing sequence of ﬁnite-dimensional lens spaces Lm—`1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`n– for n … 1; 2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 , each of which is a subcomplex of the next in the cell structure we have just con- structed, so Lm—`1;`2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– is also a CW complex. Its cellular chain complex consists of a Z in each dimension with boundary maps alternately 0 and m , so its reduced homology consists of a Zm in each odd dimension. In the terminology of x1.B, the inﬁnite-dimensional lens space Lm—`1;`2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– is an Eilenberg–MacLane space K—Zm; 1– since its universal cover S 1 is contractible, as we showed there. By Theorem 1B.8 the homotopy type of Lm—`1;`2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– depends only on m , and not on the `i ’s. This is not true in the ﬁnite-dimensional case, when two lens spaces Lm—`1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`n– and Lm—`0 1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`0 n– have the same homotopy type iff `1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 `n \u0011\u0006kn`0 1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 `0 n mod m for some integer k . A proof of this is outlined in Exercise 2 in x3.E and Exercise 29 in x4.2. For example, the 3 dimensional lens spaces L1=5 and L2=5 are not homotopy equivalent, though they have the same fundamental group and the same homology groups. On the other hand, L1=7 and L2=7 are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic. Euler Characteristic For a ﬁnite CW complex X , the Euler characteristic ˜ —X– is deﬁned to be the alternating sum Pn—−1– ncn where cn is the number of n cells of X , generalizing the familiar formula vertices − edges ‡ faces for 2 dimensional complexes. The following result shows that ˜ —X– can be deﬁned purely in terms of homology, and hence depends only on the homotopy type of X . In particular, ˜ —X– is independent of the choice of CW structure on X . Theorem 2.44. ˜ —X– … P n—−1– n rank Hn—X– . Here the rank of a ﬁnitely generated abelian group is the number of Z summands when the group is expressed as a direct sum of cyclic groups. We shall need the following fact, whose proof we leave as an exercise: If 0!A!B!C!0 is a short exact sequence of ﬁnitely generated abelian groups, then rank B … rank A ‡ rank C . Proof of 2.44: This is purely algebraic. Let 0 -! Ck dk------------! Ck−1 -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! C1 d1------------! C0 -! 0 Computations and Applications Section 2.2 147 be a chain complex of ﬁnitely generated abelian groups, with cycles Zn … Ker dn , boundaries Bn … Im dn‡1 , and homology Hn … Zn=Bn . Thus we have short exact sequences 0!Zn!Cn!Bn−1!0 and 0!Bn!Zn!Hn!0 , hence rank Cn … rank Zn ‡ rank Bn−1 rank Zn … rank Bn ‡ rank Hn Now substitute the second equation into the ﬁrst, multiply the resulting equation by —−1– n , and sum over n to get Pn—−1– n rank Cn … P n—−1– n rank Hn . Applying this with Cn … Hn—Xn;Xn−1– then gives the theorem. tu For example, the surfaces Mg and Ng have Euler characteristics ˜ —Mg– … 2 − 2g and ˜ —Ng– … 2 − g . Thus all the orientable surfaces Mg are distinguished from each other by their Euler characteristics, as are the nonorientable surfaces Ng , and there are only the relations ˜ —Mg– … ˜ —N2g– . Split Exact Sequences Suppose one has a retraction r : X!A ,so ri … 11 where i : A!X is the inclusion. The induced map i\u0003 : Hn—A–!Hn—X– is then injective since r\u0003i\u0003 … 11 . From this it follows that the boundary maps in the long exact sequence for —X; A– are zero, so the long exact sequence breaks up into short exact sequences 0 -! Hn—A– i\u0003-----! Hn—X– j\u0003-----! Hn—X; A– -! 0 The relation r\u0003i\u0003 … 11 actually gives more information than this, by the following piece of elementary algebra: Splitting Lemma. For a short exact sequence 0 -! A i-----! B j -----! C -! 0 of abelian groups the following statements are equivalent : (a) There is a homomorphism p : B!A such that pi … 11: A!A . (b) There is a homomorphism s : C!B such that js … 11: C!C . (c) There is an isomorphism B ˇ A\b C making a commutative diagram as at the right, where 0¡¡¡¡¡!A¡¡! B ¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡! AC ¡¡¡! ¡¡¡! i C 0¡¡! j © ¼ the maps in the lower row are the obvious ones, a , —a; 0– and —a; c– , c . If these conditions are satisﬁed, the exact sequence is said to split. Note that (c) is symmetric: There is no essential difference between the roles of A and C . Sketch of Proof: For the implication —a– ) —c– one checks that the map B!A\b C , b , ( p—b–; j—b–\u0001 , is an isomorphism with the desired properties. For —b– ) —c– one uses instead the map A\b C!B , —a; c– , i—a– ‡ s—c– . The opposite implications —c– ) —a– and —c– ) —b– are fairly obvious. If one wants to show —b– ) —a– directly, one can deﬁne p—b– … i−1( b − sj—b– \u0001 . Further details are left to the reader. tu 148 Chapter 2 Homology Except for the implications —b– ) —a– and —b– ) —c– , the proof works equally well for nonabelian groups. In the nonabelian case, (b) is deﬁnitely weaker than (a) and (c), and short exact sequences satisfying (b) only determine B as a semidirect product of A and C . The difﬁculty is that s—C– might not be a normal subgroup of B . In the nonabelian case one deﬁnes ‘splitting’ to mean that (b) is satisﬁed. In both the abelian and nonabelian contexts, if C is free then every exact sequence 0!A i-----! B j -----! C!0 splits, since one can deﬁne s : C!B by choosing a basis fc\u000bg for C and letting s—c\u000b– be any element b\u000b 2 B such that j—b\u000b– … c\u000b . The converse is also true: If every short exact sequence ending in C splits, then C is free. This is because for every C there is a short exact sequence 0!A!B!C!0 with B free — choose generators for C and let B have a basis in one-to-one correspondence with these generators, then let B!C send each basis element to the corresponding gen- erator — so if this sequence 0!A!B!C!0 splits, C is isomorphic to a subgroup of a free group, hence is free. From the Splitting Lemma and the remarks preceding it we deduce that a retrac- tion r : X!A gives a splitting Hn—X– ˇ Hn—A–\b Hn—X; A– . This can be used to show the nonexistence of such a retraction in some cases, for example in the situation of the Brouwer ﬁxed point theorem, where a retraction Dn!S n−1 would give an im- possible splitting Hn−1—Dn– ˇ Hn−1—S n−1–\b Hn−1—Dn;S n−1– . For a somewhat more subtle example, consider the mapping cylinder Mf of a degree m map f : S n!S n with m> 1. If Mf retracted onto the S n ˆ Mf corresponding to the domain of f , we would have a split short exact sequence ¡¡¡¡¡¡! Z ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! m Z ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! Z ¡¡¡¡¡! 00 ¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡! 00 H ()S n n H ()Mf Mfn H ()S n n m ,====== But this sequence does not split since Z is not isomorphic to Z\b Zm if m> 1 , so the retraction cannot exist. In the simplest case of the degree 2 map S 1!S 1 , z , z2 , this says that the M¨obius band does not retract onto its boundary circle. Homology of Groups In x1.B we constructed for each group G a CW complex K—G; 1– having a con- tractible universal cover, and we showed that the homotopy type of such a space K—G; 1– is uniquely determined by G . The homology groups Hn( K—G; 1–\u0001 therefore depend only on G , and are usually denoted simply Hn—G– . The calculations for lens spaces in Example 2.43 show that Hn—Zm– is Zm for odd n and 0 for even n> 0. Since S 1 is a K—Z; 1– and the torus is a K—Z\u0002 Z; 1– , we also know the homology of these two groups. More generally, the homology of ﬁnitely generated abelian groups can be computed from these examples using the K¨unneth formula in x3.B and the fact that a product K—G; 1–\u0002 K—H; 1– is a K—G\u0002 H; 1– . Here is an application of the calculation of Hn—Zm– : Computations and Applications Section 2.2 149 Proposition 2.45. If a ﬁnite-dimensional CW complex X is a K—G; 1– , then the group G … ˇ1—X– must be torsionfree. This applies to quite a few manifolds, for example closed surfaces other than S 2 and RP2 , and also many 3 dimensional manifolds such as complements of knots in S 3 . Proof:If G had torsion, it would have a ﬁnite cyclic subgroup Zm for some m> 1, and the covering space of X corresponding to this subgroup of G … ˇ1—X– would be a K—Zm; 1– . Since X is a ﬁnite-dimensional CW complex, the same would be true of its covering space K—Zm; 1– , and hence the homology of the K—Zm; 1– would be nonzero in only ﬁnitely many dimensions. But this contradicts the fact that Hn—Zm– is nonzero for inﬁnitely many values of n . tu Reﬂecting the richness of group theory, the homology of groups has been studied quite extensively. A good starting place for those wishing to learn more is the text- book [Brown 1982]. At a more advanced level the books [Adem & Milgram 1994] and [Benson 1992] treat the subject from a mostly topological viewpoint. Mayer–Vietoris Sequences In addition to the long exact sequence of homology groups for a pair —X; A– , there is another sort of long exact sequence, known as a Mayer–Vietoris sequence, which is equally powerful but is sometimes more convenient to use. For a pair of subspaces A , B ˆ X such that X is the union of the interiors of A and B , this exact sequence has the form \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Hn—A \\ B– Ø------------! Hn—A– \b Hn—B– Ù------------! Hn—X– @------------! Hn−1—A \\ B– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! H0—X– -! 0 In addition to its usefulness for calculations, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is also ap- plied frequently in induction arguments, where one might know that a certain state- ment is true for A , B , and A \\ B by induction and then deduce that it is true for A [ B by the exact sequence. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is easy to derive from the machinery of x2.1. Let Cn—A ‡ B– be the subgroup of Cn—X– consisting of chains that are sums of chains in A and chains in B . The usual boundary map @ : Cn—X–!Cn−1—X– takes Cn—A ‡ B– to Cn−1—A ‡ B– , so the Cn—A ‡ B– ’s form a chain complex. According to Proposition 2.21, the inclusions Cn—A ‡ B– > Cn—X– induce isomorphisms on homology groups. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is then the long exact sequence of homology groups asso- ciated to the short exact sequence of chain complexes formed by the short exact sequences 0 -! Cn—A \\ B– ' ------------! Cn—A– \b Cn—B– ------------! Cn—A ‡ B– -! 0 150 Chapter 2 Homology where '—x– … —x; −x– and —x; y– … x ‡ y . The exactness of this short exact sequence can be checked as follows. First, Ker ' … 0 since a chain in A \\ B that is zero as a chain in A (or in B ) must be the zero chain. Next, Im ' ˆ Ker since ' … 0 . Also, Ker ˆ Im ' since for a pair —x; y– 2 Cn—A–\b Cn—B– the condition x ‡ y … 0 implies x …−y ,so x is a chain in both A and B , that is, x 2 Cn—A \\ B– , and —x; y– … —x; −x– 2 Im ' . Finally, exactness at Cn—A ‡ B– is immediate from the deﬁnition of Cn—A ‡ B– . The boundary map @ : Hn—X–!Hn−1—A \\ B– can easily be made explicit. A class \u000b 2 Hn—X– is represented by a cycle z , and by barycentric subdivision or some other method we can choose z to be a sum x ‡y of chains in A and B , respectively. It need not be true that x and y are cycles individually, but @x …−@y since @—x ‡ y– … 0, and the element @\u000b 2 Hn−1—A \\ B– is represented by the cycle @x …−@y , as is clear from the deﬁnition of the boundary map in the long exact sequence of homology groups associated to a short exact sequence of chain complexes. There is also a formally identical Mayer–Vietoris sequence for reduced homology groups, obtained by augmenting the previous short exact sequence of chain complexes in the obvious way:¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!ABC0 00 ()¡¡¡¡¡!0AC () 0 BC ()\\ © © © 0 AC ( B )+ Ã Ã ' ' \"\"\"\" ¡¡¡¡¡¡! Z ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ZZ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! Z ¡¡¡¡¡! 00 Mayer–Vietoris sequences can be viewed as analogs of the van Kampen theorem since if A\\B is path-connected, the H1 terms of the reduced Mayer–Vietoris sequence yield an isomorphism H1—X– ˇ ( H1—A–\b H1—B– \u0001 = Im Ø . This is exactly the abelianized statement of the van Kampen theorem, and H1 is the abelianization of ˇ1 for path- connected spaces, as we show in x2.A. There are also Mayer–Vietoris sequences for decompositions X … A [ B such that A and B are deformation retracts of neighborhoods U and V with U \\V deformation retracting onto A \\ B . Under these assumptions the ﬁve-lemma implies that the maps Cn—A ‡ B–!Cn—U ‡ V– induce isomorphisms on homology, and hence so do the maps Cn—A ‡ B–!Cn—X– , which was all that we needed to obtain a Mayer–Vietoris sequence. For example, if X is a CW complex and A and B are subcomplexes, then we can choose for U and V neighborhoods of the form N\"—A– and N\"—B– constructed in the Appendix, which have the property that N\"—A– \\ N\"—B– … N\"—A \\ B– . Example 2.46. Take X … S n with A and B the northern and southern hemispheres, so that A \\ B … S n−1 . Then in the reduced Mayer–Vietoris sequence the terms eHi—A–\b eHi—B– are zero, so we obtain isomorphisms eHi—S n– ˇ eHi−1—S n−1– . This gives another way of calculating the homology groups of S n by induction. Example 2.47. We can decompose the Klein bottle K as the union of two M¨obius bands A and B glued together by a homeomorphism between their boundary circles. Computations and Applications Section 2.2 151 Then A , B , and A \\ B are homotopy equivalent to circles, so the interesting part of the reduced Mayer–Vietoris sequence for the decomposition K … A [ B is the segment 0 -! H2—K– -! H1—A \\ B– Ø-----! H1—A–\b H1—B– -! H1—K– -! 0 The map Ø is Z!Z\b Z ,1,—2; −2– , since the boundary circle of a M¨obius band wraps twice around the core circle. Since Ø is injective we obtain H2—K– … 0 . Furthermore, we have H1—K– ˇ Z\b Z2 since we can choose —1; 0– and —1; −1– as a basis for Z\b Z . All the higher homology groups of K are zero from the earlier part of the Mayer–Vietoris sequence. Example 2.48. Let us describe an exact sequence which is somewhat similar to the Mayer–Vietoris sequence and which in some cases generalizes it. If we are given two maps f; g : X!Y then we can form a quotient space Z of the disjoint union of X \u0002 I and Y via the identiﬁcations —x; 0– ˘ f—x– and —x; 1– ˘ g—x– , thus attaching one end of X \u0002 I to Y by f and the other end by g . For example, if f and g are each the identity map X!X then Z … X \u0002 S 1 . If only one of f and g , say f , is the identity map, then Z is homeomorphic to what is called the mapping torus of g , the quotient space of X \u0002 I under the identiﬁcations —x; 0– ˘ —g—x–; 1– . The Klein bottle is an example, with g a reﬂection S 1!S 1 . The exact sequence we want has the form —\u0003– \u0001\u0001\u0001 ----! Hn—X– f\u0003−g\u0003----------------------------! Hn—Y – i\u0003---------! Hn—Z– ----! Hn−1—X– f\u0003−g\u0003----------------------------! Hn−1—Y – ----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 where i is the evident inclusion Y > Z . To derive this exact sequence, consider the map q : —X \u0002 I; X \u0002 @I–!—Z; Y – that is the restriction to X \u0002 I of the quotient map X \u0002 I q Y!Z . The map q induces a map of long exact sequences:¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡! XIH (), ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! YZH (), YHn() ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!ZHn()n 1+ n 1+ £ XH (n i £ ¡¡¡!¡¡¡!) XH (n £XI£ @ @ @ I )I@ ¤ i¤ q¤¡¡¡¡¡!q¤¡¡¡¡¡!q¤ ... ... ... ... 0 0 In the upper row the middle term is the direct sum of two copies of Hn—X– , and the map i\u0003 is surjective since X \u0002 I deformation retracts onto X \u0002f0g and X \u0002f1g . Sur- jectivity of the maps i\u0003 in the upper row implies that the next maps are 0 , which in turn implies that the maps @ are injective. Thus the map @ in the upper row gives an isomorphism of Hn‡1—X \u0002 I; X \u0002 @I– onto the kernel of i\u0003 , which consists of the pairs —\u000b; −\u000b– for \u000b 2 Hn—X– . This kernel is a copy of Hn—X– , and the middle vertical map q\u0003 takes —\u000b; −\u000b– to f\u0003—\u000b– − g\u0003—\u000b– . The left-hand q\u0003 is an isomor- phism since these are good pairs and q induces a homeomorphism of quotient spaces —X \u0002 I–=—X \u0002 @I–!Z=Y . Hence if we replace Hn‡1—Z; Y – in the lower exact sequence by the isomorphic group Hn—X– ˇ Ker i\u0003 we obtain the long exact sequence we want. In the case of the mapping torus of a reﬂection g : S 1!S 1 , with Z a Klein bottle, the interesting portion of the exact sequence —\u0003– is 152 Chapter 2 Homology Z ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! Z ¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡!0==H ()S1 1 H ()Z2 H ()S1 1 ¡¡¡!H ()S0 1 H ()Z1 H ()S0 1 2 Z ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! Z== 0 11 ¤- g ¡¡¡¡! 11 ¤- g Thus H2—Z– … 0 and we have a short exact sequence 0!Z2!H1—Z–!Z!0 . This splits since Z is free, so H1—Z– ˇ Z2 \b Z . Other examples are given in the Exercises. If Y is the disjoint union of spaces Y1 and Y2 , with f : X!Y1 and g : X!Y2 , then Z consists of the mapping cylinders of these two maps with their domain ends identiﬁed. For example, suppose we have a CW complex decomposed as the union of two subcomplexes A and B and we take f and g to be the inclusions A \\ B > A and A \\ B > B . Then the double mapping cylinder Z is homotopy equivalent to A [ B since we can view Z as —A \\ B–\u0002 I with A and B attached at the two ends, and then slide the attaching of A down to the B end to produce A [ B with —A \\ B–\u0002 I attached at one of its ends. By Proposition 0.18 the sliding operation preserves homotopy type, so we obtain a homotopy equivalence Z ' A [ B . The exact sequence —\u0003– in this case is the Mayer–Vietoris sequence. A relative form of the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is sometimes useful. If one has a pair of spaces —X; Y – … —A [ B; C [ D– with C ˆ A and D ˆ B , such that X is the union of the interiors of A and B , and Y is the union of the interiors of C and D , then there is a relative Mayer–Vietoris sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Hn—A \\ B; C \\ D– Ø------------! Hn—A; C– \b Hn—B; D– Ù------------! Hn—X; Y – @------------! \u0001\u0001\u0001 To derive this, consider the commutative diagram¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!CDC0 ()¡¡!0CC () DC ()\\ © CC ( D)+ Ã'¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!ABC0 ()¡¡!0AC () BC ()\\ © AC ( B )+ Ã'¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡!ABC0 00 0 00 0 ()¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! 0AC () BC ()\\ CD\\ © AC ( B )+ CD+ Ã' nn n n nn n n nn n n, C, D,, where Cn—A ‡ B; C ‡ D– is the quotient of the subgroup Cn—A ‡ B– ˆ Cn—X– by its subgroup Cn—C ‡ D– ˆ Cn—Y – . Thus the three columns of the diagram are exact. We have seen that the ﬁrst two rows are exact, and we claim that the third row is exact also, with the maps ' and induced from the ' and in the second row. Since ' … 0 in the second row, this holds also in the third row, so the third row is at least a chain complex. Viewing the three rows as chain complexes, the diagram then represents a short exact sequence of chain complexes. The associated long exact sequence of homology groups has two out of every three terms zero since the ﬁrst two rows of the diagram are exact. Hence the remaining homology groups are zero and the third row is exact. Computations and Applications Section 2.2 153 The third column maps to 0!Cn—Y –!Cn—X–!Cn—X; Y –!0 , inducing maps of homology groups that are isomorphisms for the X and Y terms as we have seen above. So by the ﬁve-lemma the maps Cn—A‡B; C ‡D–!Cn—X; Y – also induce isomorphisms on homology. The relative Mayer–Vietoris sequence is then the long exact sequence of homology groups associated to the short exact sequence of chain complexes given by the third row of the diagram. Homology with Coefﬁcients There is an easy generalization of the homology theory we have considered so far that behaves in a very similar fashion and sometimes offers technical advan- tages. The generalization consists of using chains of the form P i ni˙i where each ˙i is a singular n simplex in X as before, but now the coefﬁcients ni are taken to lie in a ﬁxed abelian group G rather than Z . Such n chains form an abelian group Cn—X; G– , and there is the expected relative version Cn—X; A; G– … Cn—X; G–=Cn—A; G– . The old formula for the boundary maps @ can still be used for arbitrary G , namely @(Pi ni˙i\u0001 … P i;j—−1– jni˙i jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvj; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ . Just as before, a calculation shows that @2 … 0 , so the groups Cn—X; G– and Cn—X; A; G– form chain complexes. The resulting homology groups Hn—X; G– and Hn—X; A; G– are called homology groups with coefﬁcients in G. Reduced groups eHn—X; G– are deﬁned via the augmented chain complex \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! C0—X; G– \"-----! G -! 0 with \" again deﬁned by summing coefﬁcients. The case G … Z2 is particularly simple since one is just considering sums of sin- gular simplices with coefﬁcients 0 or 1 , so by discarding terms with coefﬁcient 0 one can think of chains as just ﬁnite ‘unions’ of singular simplices. The boundary formulas also simplify since one no longer has to worry about signs. Since signs are an algebraic representation of orientation considerations, one can also ignore orien- tations. This means that homology with Z2 coefﬁcients is often the most natural tool in the absence of orientability. All the theory we developed in x2.1 for Z coefﬁcients carries over directly to general coefﬁcient groups G with no change in the proofs. The same is true for Mayer– Vietoris sequences. Differences between Hn—X; G– and Hn—X– begin to appear only when one starts making calculations. When X is a point, the method used to compute Hn—X– shows that Hn—X; G– is G for n … 0 and 0 for n> 0 . From this it follows just as for G … Z that eHn—S k; G– is G for n … k and 0 otherwise. Cellular homology also generalizes to homology with coefﬁcients, with the cellu- lar chain group Hn—Xn;Xn−1– replaced by Hn—Xn;Xn−1; G– , which is a direct sum of G ’s, one for each n cell. The proof that the cellular homology groups HCW n —X– agree with singular homology Hn—X– extends immediately to give HCW n —X; G– ˇ Hn—X; G– . The cellular boundary maps are given by the same formula as for Z coefﬁcients, dn(P \u000b n\u000ben \u000b\u0001 … P \u000b;\f d\u000b\fn\u000ben−1 \f . The old proof applies, but the following result is needed to know that the coefﬁcients d\u000b\f are the same as before: 154 Chapter 2 Homology Lemma 2.49. If f : S k!S k has degree m , then f\u0003 : Hk—S k; G–!Hk—S k; G– is multi- plication by m . Proof: As a preliminary observation, note that a homomorphism ' : G1!G2 induces maps '] : Cn—X; A; G1–!Cn—X; A; G2– commuting with boundary maps, so there are induced homomorphisms '\u0003 : Hn—X; A; G1–!Hn—X; A; G2– . These have various nat- urality properties. For example, they give a commutative diagram mapping the long exact sequence of homology for the pair —X; A– with G1 coefﬁcients to the correspond- ing sequence with G2 coefﬁcients. Also, the maps '\u0003 commute with homomorphisms f\u0003 induced by maps f : —X; A–!—Y ; B– . Now let f : S k!S k have degree m and let ' : Z!G take 1 to a given element g 2 G . Then we have a commutative diagram as at the right, where commu-¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡! k SH () f¤ ¤ f¤ » k ¼ ¡¡¡¡¡¡! k SG GH () » k ¼ ¼ ¼ ''¤' ; ; Z¡¡¡¡¡! k SH () » k k SGH () » k ; ; ZZ¡¡¡¡¡! G ' Z tativity of the outer two squares comes from the inductive calculation of these homology groups, reducing to the case k … 0 when the commutativity is obvious. Since the diagram commutes, the assumption that the map across the top takes 1to m implies that the map across the bottom takes g to mg . tu Example 2.50. It is instructive to see what happens to the homology of RPn when the coefﬁcient group G is chosen to be a ﬁeld F . The cellular chain complex is \u0001\u0001\u0001 0-----! F 2-----! F 0-----! F 2-----! F 0-----! F -! 0 Hence if F has characteristic 2 , for example if F … Z2 , then Hk—RPn; F– ˇ F for 0 \u0014 k \u0014 n , a more uniform answer than with Z coefﬁcients. On the other hand, if F has characteristic different from 2 then the boundary maps F 2-----! F are isomor- phisms, hence Hk—RPn; F– is F for k … 0 and for k … n odd, and is zero otherwise. In x3.A we will see that there is a general algebraic formula expressing homology with arbitrary coefﬁcients in terms of homology with Z coefﬁcients. Some easy special cases that give much of the ﬂavor of the general result are included in the Exercises. In spite of the fact that homology with Z coefﬁcients determines homology with other coefﬁcient groups, there are many situations where homology with a suitably chosen coefﬁcient group can provide more information than homology with Z coef- ﬁcients. A good example of this is the proof of the Borsuk–Ulam theorem using Z2 coefﬁcients in x2.B. As another illustration, we will now give an example of a map f : X!Y with the property that the induced maps f\u0003 are trivial for homology with Z coefﬁcients but not for homology with Zm coefﬁcients for suitably chosen m . Thus homology with Zm coefﬁcients tells us that f is not homotopic to a constant map, which we would not know using only Z coefﬁcients. Computations and Applications Section 2.2 155 Example 2.51. Let X be a Moore space M—Zm;n– obtained from S n by attaching a cell en‡1 by a map of degree m . The quotient map f : X!X=S n … S n‡1 induces trivial homomorphisms on reduced homology with Z coefﬁcients since the nonzero reduced homology groups of X and S n‡1 occur in different dimensions. But with Zm coefﬁcients the story is different, as we can see by considering the long exact sequence of the pair —X; S n– , which contains the segment 0 … eHn‡1—S n; Zm– -! eHn‡1—X; Zm– f\u0003-----! eHn‡1—X=S n; Zm– Exactness says that f\u0003 is injective, hence nonzero since eHn‡1—X; Zm– is Zm , the cel- lular boundary map Hn‡1—Xn‡1;Xn; Zm–!Hn—Xn;Xn−1; Zm– being Zm m-----!

The short exact sequences 0!Cn—A–!Cn—X–!Cn—X; A–!0 always split, but why does this not always yield splittings Hn—X– ˇ Hn—A–\b Hn—X; A– ? 28. (a) Use the Mayer–Vietoris sequence to compute the homology groups of the space obtained from a torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 by attaching a M¨obius band via a homeomorphism from the boundary circle of the M¨obius band to the circle S 1 \u0002fx0g in the torus.

Derive the long exact sequence of a pair —X; A– from the Mayer–Vietoris sequence applied to X [ CA , where CA is the cone on A . [We showed after the proof of Proposition 2.22 that Hn—X; A– ˇ eHn—X [ CA– for all n .] 35. Use the Mayer–Vietoris sequence to show that a nonorientable closed surface, or more generally a ﬁnite simplicial complex X for which H1—X– contains torsion, cannot be embedded as a subspace of R3 in such a way as to have a neighborhood homeomorphic to the mapping cylinder of some map from a closed orientable surface to X . [This assumption on a neighborhood is in fact not needed if one deduces the result from Alexander duality in x3.3.] 36.

G for each Zm summand of Hn−1—X– 160 Chapter 2 Homology Sometimes it is good to step back from the forest of details and look for gen- eral patterns. In this rather brief section we will ﬁrst describe the general pattern of homology by axioms, then we will look at some common formal features shared by many of the constructions we have made, using the language of categories and functors which has become common in much of modern mathematics. Axioms for Homology For simplicity let us restrict attention to CW complexes and focus on reduced ho- mology to avoid mentioning relative homology. A (reduced) homology theory assigns to each nonempty CW complex X a sequence of abelian groups ehn—X– and to each map f : X!Y between CW complexes a sequence of homomorphisms f\u0003 : ehn—X–! ehn—Y – such that —f g–\u0003 … f\u0003g\u0003 and 11\u0003 … 11 , and so that the following three axioms are satisﬁed. (1) If f ' g : X!Y , then f\u0003 … g\u0003 : ehn—X–! ehn—Y – . (2) There are boundary homomorphisms @ : ehn—X=A–! ehn−1—A– deﬁned for each CW pair —X; A– , ﬁtting into an exact sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 @------------! ehn—A– i\u0003------------! ehn—X– q\u0003------------! ehn—X=A– @------------! ehn−1—A– i\u0003------------! \u0001\u0001\u0001 where i is the inclusion and q is the quotient map. Furthermore the boundary maps are natural: For f : —X; A–!—Y ; B– inducing a quotient map f : X=A!Y=B , there are commutative diagrams Y/ X/ -n 1 -n 1 @ @ A¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!h n() ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!Bh n Ah () Bh ()() f¤ f¤ »» »» ¡ (3) For a wedge sum X … W \u000b X\u000b with inclusions i\u000b : X\u000b > X , the direct sum map L \u000b i\u000b\u0003 : L \u000b ehn—X\u000b–! ehn—X– is an isomorphism for each n . Negative values for the subscripts n are permitted. Ordinary singular homology is zero in negative dimensions by deﬁnition, but interesting homology theories with nontrivial groups in negative dimensions do exist. The third axiom may seem less substantial than the ﬁrst two, and indeed for ﬁnite wedge sums it can be deduced from the ﬁrst two axioms, though not in general for inﬁnite wedge sums, as an example in the Exercises shows. It is also possible, and not much more difﬁcult, to give axioms for unreduced homology theories. One supposes one has relative groups hn—X; A– deﬁned, special- izing to absolute groups by setting hn—X– … hn—X; ;– . Axiom (1) is replaced by its The Formal Viewpoint Section 2.3 161 obvious relative form, and axiom (2) is broken into two parts, the ﬁrst hypothesizing a long exact sequence involving these relative groups, with natural boundary maps, the second stating some version of excision, for example hn—X; A– ˇ hn—X=A; A=A– if one is dealing with CW pairs. In axiom (3) the wedge sum is replaced by disjoint union. These axioms for unreduced homology are essentially the same as those origi- nally laid out in the highly inﬂuential book [Eilenberg & Steenrod 1952], except that axiom (3) was omitted since the focus there was on ﬁnite complexes, and there was another axiom specifying that the groups hn—point – are zero for n ﬂ 0 , as is true for singular homology. This axiom was called the ‘dimension axiom,’ presumably be- cause it speciﬁes that a point has nontrivial homology only in dimension zero. It can be regarded as a normalization axiom, since one can trivially deﬁne a homology the- ory where it fails by setting hn—X; A– … Hn‡k—X; A– for a ﬁxed nonzero integer k .At the time there were no interesting homology theories known for which the dimension axiom did not hold, but soon thereafter topologists began studying a homology theory called ‘bordism’ having the property that the bordism groups of a point are nonzero in inﬁnitely many dimensions. Axiom (3) seems to have appeared ﬁrst in [Milnor 1962]. Reduced and unreduced homology theories are essentially equivalent. From an unreduced theory h one gets a reduced theory eh by setting ehn—X– equal to the kernel of the canonical map hn—X–!hn—point – . In the other direction, one sets hn—X– … ehn—X‡– where X‡ is the disjoint union of X with a point. We leave it as an exercise to show that these two transformations between reduced and unre- duced homology are inverses of each other. Just as with ordinary homology, one has hn—X– ˇ ehn—X–\b hn—x0– for any point x0 2 X , since the long exact sequence of the pair —X; x0– splits via the retraction of X onto x0 . Note that ehn—x0– … 0 for all n , as can be seen by looking at the long exact sequence of reduced homology groups of the pair —x0;x0– . The groups hn—x0– ˇ ehn—S 0– are called the coefﬁcients of the homology theo- ries h and eh , by analogy with the case of singular homology with coefﬁcients. One can trivially realize any sequence of abelian groups Gi as the coefﬁcient groups of a homology theory by setting hn—X; A– … L i Hn−i—X; A; Gi– . In general, homology theories are not uniquely determined by their coefﬁcient groups, but this is true for singular homology: If h is a homology theory deﬁned for CW pairs, whose coefﬁcient groups hn—x0– are zero for n ﬂ 0 , then there are natural isomorphisms hn—X; A– ˇ Hn—X; A; G– for all CW pairs —X; A– and all n , where G … h0—x0– . This will be proved in Theorem 4.59. We have seen how Mayer–Vietoris sequences can be quite useful for singular ho- mology, and in fact every homology theory has Mayer–Vietoris sequences, at least for CW complexes. These can be obtained directly from the axioms in the follow- 162 Chapter 2 Homology ing way. For a CW complex X … A [ B with A and B subcomplexes, the inclusion —B; A \\ B– > —X; A– induces a commutative diagram of exact sequences n n ... ... ... ...¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!BA Bh ()¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!Bh nn ()h (), ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡!h () Xh nn h () h ()()Ah () ¼¼ \\ BA B, \\AB\\n 1+ n 1+ AX, AX, The vertical maps between relative groups are isomorphisms since B=—A \\ B– … X=A . Then it is a purely algebraic fact, whose proof is Exercise 38 at the end of the previous section, that a diagram such as this with every third vertical map an isomorphism gives rise to a long exact sequence involving the remaining nonisomorphic terms. In the present case this takes the form of a Mayer-Vietoris sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! hn—A \\ B– ' -----! hn—A– \b hn—B– -----! hn—X– @-----! hn−1—A \\ B– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 Categories and Functors Formally, singular homology can be regarded as a sequence of functions Hn that assign to each space X an abelian group Hn—X– and to each map f : X!Y a homo- morphism Hn—f – … f\u0003 : Hn—X–!Hn—Y – , and similarly for relative homology groups. This sort of situation arises quite often, and not just in algebraic topology, so it is useful to introduce some general terminology for it. Roughly speaking, ‘functions’ like Hn are called ‘functors,’ and the domains and ranges of these functors are called ‘categories.’ Thus for Hn the domain category consists of topological spaces and con- tinuous maps, or in the relative case, pairs of spaces and continuous maps of pairs, and the range category consists of abelian groups and homomorphisms. A key point is that one is interested not only in the objects in the category, for example spaces or groups, but also in the maps, or ‘morphisms,’ between these objects. Now for the precise deﬁnitions. A category C consists of three things: (1) A collection Ob—C– of objects. (2) Sets Mor—X; Y – of morphisms for each pair X; Y 2 Ob—C– , including a distin- guished ‘identity’ morphism 11 … 11X 2 Mor—X; X– for each X . (3) A ‘composition of morphisms’ function \u000e : Mor—X; Y –\u0002 Mor—Y ; Z–!Mor—X; Z– for each triple X; Y ; Z 2 Ob—C– , satisfying f \u000e 11 … f , 11 \u000e f … f; and —f \u000e g– \u000e h … f \u000e —g \u000e h– . There are plenty of obvious examples, such as: The category of topological spaces, with continuous maps as the morphisms. Or we could restrict to special classes of spaces such as CW complexes, keeping continuous maps as the morphisms. We could also restrict the morphisms, for example to homeomorphisms. The category of groups, with homomorphisms as morphisms. Or the subcategory of abelian groups, again with homomorphisms as the morphisms. Generalizing The Formal Viewpoint Section 2.3 163 this is the category of modules over a ﬁxed ring, with morphisms the module homomorphisms. The category of sets, with arbitrary functions as the morphisms. Or the mor- phisms could be restricted to injections, surjections, or bijections. There are also many categories where the morphisms are not simply functions, for example: Any group G can be viewed as a category with only one object and with G as the morphisms of this object, so that condition (3) reduces to two of the three axioms for a group. If we require only these two axioms, associativity and a left and right identity, we have a ‘group without inverses,’ usually called a monoid since it is the same thing as a category with one object. A partially ordered set —X; \u0014– can be considered a category where the objects are the elements of X and there is a unique morphism from x to y whenever x \u0014 y . The relation x \u0014 x gives the morphism 11 and transitivity gives the composition Mor—x; y–\u0002 Mor—y; z–!Mor—x; z– . The condition that x \u0014 y and y \u0014 x implies x … y says that there is at most one morphism between any two objects. There is a ‘homotopy category’ whose objects are topological spaces and whose morphisms are homotopy classes of maps, rather than actual maps. This uses the fact that composition is well-deﬁned on homotopy classes: f0g0 ' f1g1 if f0 ' f1 and g0 ' g1 . Chain complexes are the objects of a category, with chain maps as morphisms. This category has various interesting subcategories, obtained by restricting the objects. For example, we could take chain complexes whose groups are zero in negative dimensions, or zero outside a ﬁnite range. Or we could restrict to exact sequences, or short exact sequences. In each case we take morphisms to be chain maps, which are commutative diagrams. Going a step further, there is a category whose objects are short exact sequences of chain complexes and whose morphisms are commutative diagrams of maps between such short exact sequences. A functor F from a category C to a category D assigns to each object X in C an object F—X– in D and to each morphism f 2 Mor—X; Y – in C a morphism F—f – 2 Mor ( F —X–; F —Y – \u0001 in D , such that F—11– … 11 and F—f \u000e g– … F—f – \u000e F—g– . In the case of the singular homology functor Hn , the latter two conditions are the familiar properties 11\u0003 … 11 and —f g–\u0003 … f\u0003g\u0003 of induced maps. Strictly speaking, what we have just deﬁned is a covariant functor. A contravariant functor would differ from this by assigning to f 2 Mor—X; Y – a ‘backwards’ morphism F—f – 2 Mor ( F —Y –; F —X– \u0001 with F—11– … 11 and F—f \u000e g– … F—g– \u000e F—f – . A classical example of this is the dual vector space functor, which assigns to a vector space V over a ﬁxed scalar ﬁeld K the dual vector space F—V – … V \u0003 of linear maps V!K , and to each linear transformation 164 Chapter 2 Homology f : V!W the dual map F—f – … f \u0003 : W \u0003!V \u0003 , going in the reverse direction. In the next chapter we will study the contravariant version of homology, called cohomology. A number of the constructions we have studied in this chapter are functors: The singular chain complex functor assigns to a space X the chain complex of singular chains in X and to a map f : X!Y the induced chain map. This is a functor from the category of spaces and continuous maps to the category of chain complexes and chain maps. The algebraic homology functor assigns to a chain complex its sequence of ho- mology groups and to a chain map the induced homomorphisms on homology. This is a functor from the category of chain complexes and chain maps to the category whose objects are sequences of abelian groups and whose morphisms are sequences of homomorphisms. The composition of the two preceding functors is the functor assigning to a space its singular homology groups. The ﬁrst example above, the singular chain complex functor, can itself be re- garded as the composition of two functors. The ﬁrst functor assigns to a space X its singular complex S—X– ,a Ñ complex, and the second functor assigns to a Ñ complex its simplicial chain complex. This is what the two functors do on objects, and what they do on morphisms can be described in the following way. A map of spaces f : X!Y induces a map f\u0003 : S—X–!S—Y – by composing singular simplices Ñn!X with f . The map f\u0003 is a map between Ñ complexes taking the distinguished characteristic maps in the domain Ñ complex to the distinguished characteristic maps in the target Ñ complex. Call such maps ∆ maps and let them be the morphisms in the category of Ñ complexes. Note that a Ñ map in- duces a chain map between simplicial chain complexes, taking basis elements to basis elements, so we have a simplicial chain complex functor taking the category of Ñ complexes and Ñ maps to the category of chain complexes and chain maps. There is a functor assigning to a pair of spaces —X; A– the associated long exact sequence of homology groups. Morphisms in the domain category are maps of pairs, and in the target category morphisms are maps between exact sequences forming commutative diagrams. This functor is the composition of two functors, the ﬁrst assigning to —X; A– a short exact sequence of chain complexes, the sec- ond assigning to such a short exact sequence the associated long exact sequence of homology groups. Morphisms in the intermediate category are the evident commutative diagrams. Another sort of process we have encountered is the transformation of one functor into another, for example: Boundary maps Hn—X; A–!Hn−1—A– in singular homology, or indeed in any ho- mology theory. The Formal Viewpoint Section 2.3 165 Change-of-coefﬁcient homomorphisms Hn—X; G1–!Hn—X; G2– induced by a ho- momorphism G1!G2 , as in the proof of Lemma 2.49. In general, if one has two functors F; G : C!D then a natural transformation T from F to G assigns a morphism TX : F—X–!G—X– to each object X 2 C , in such a way that for each morphism f : X!Y in C the square at the right commutes. The case that F and G¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! TX TY XF () fF () fG( ) YF () ¡¡¡¡¡!XG() YG()are contravariant rather than covariant is similar. We have been describing the passage from topology to the abstract world of cat- egories and functors, but there is also a nice path in the opposite direction: To each category C there is associated a Ñ complex BC called the classifying space of C , whose n simplices are the strings X0!X1! \u0001\u0001\u0001 !Xn of morphisms in C . The faces of this simplex are obtained by deleting an Xi , and then compos- ing the two adjacent morphisms if i ﬂ 0;n . Thus when n … 2 the three faces of X0!X1!X2 are X0!X1 , X1!X2 , and the composed morphism X0!X2 .In case C has a single object and the morphisms of C form a group G , then BC is the same as the Ñ complex BG constructed in Example 1B.7, a K—G; 1– . In gen- eral, the space BC need not be a K—G; 1– , however. For example, if we start with a Ñ complex X and regard its set of simplices as a partially ordered set C—X– under the relation of inclusion of faces, then BC—X– is the barycentric subdivision of X . A functor F : C!D induces a map BC!BD . This is the Ñ map that sends an n simplex X0!X1! \u0001\u0001\u0001 !Xn to the n simplex F—X0–!F—X1–! \u0001\u0001\u0001 !F—Xn– . A natural transformation from a functor F to a functor G induces a homotopy between the induced maps of classifying spaces. We leave this for the reader to make explicit, using the subdivision of Ñ n \u0002 I into —n ‡ 1– simplices described earlier in the chapter. Exercises 1.If Tn—X; A– denotes the torsion subgroup of Hn—X; A; Z– , show that the functors —X; A– , Tn—X; A– , with the obvious induced homomorphisms Tn—X; A–!Tn—Y ; B– and boundary maps Tn—X; A–!Tn−1—A– , do not deﬁne a homology theory.

Deduce that there are suspension isomorphisms ehn—X– ˇ ehn‡1—SX– for all n . 4. Show that the wedge axiom for homology theories follows from the other axioms in the case of ﬁnite wedge sums. 166 Chapter 2 Homology There is a close connection between H1—X– and ˇ1—X– , arising from the fact that a map f : I!X can be viewed as either a path or a singular 1 simplex. If f is a loop, with f—0– … f—1– , this singular 1 simplex is a cycle since @f … f—1– − f—0– . Theorem 2A.1. By regarding loops as singular 1 cycles, we obtain a homomorphism h : ˇ1—X; x0–!H1—X– .If X is path-connected, then h is surjective and has kernel the commutator subgroup of ˇ1—X– ,so h induces an isomorphism from the abelian- ization of ˇ1—X– onto H1—X– . Proof: Recall the notation f ' g for the relation of homotopy, ﬁxing endpoints, between paths f and g . Regarding f and g as chains, the notation f ˘ g will mean that f is homologous to g , that is, f − g is the boundary of some 2 chain. Here are some facts about this relation. (i) If f is a constant path, then f ˘ 0 . Namely, f is a cycle since it is a loop, and since H1—point – … 0, f must then be a boundary. Explicitly, f is the boundary of the constant singular 2 simplex ˙ having the same image as f since @˙ … ˙ jj ƒv1;v2⁄ − ˙ jj ƒv0;v2⁄ ‡ ˙ jj ƒv0;v1⁄ … f − f ‡ f … f (ii) If f ' g then f ˘ g . To see this, consider a homotopy F : I \u0002 I!X from f to g . This yields a pair of singular 2 simplices ˙1 and ˙2 in X by subdividing the square I \u0002 I into two triangles ƒv0;v1;v3⁄ and ƒv0;v2;v3⁄ as shown in the ﬁgure. When one computes @—˙1 − ˙2– , the two restrictions of F to the diagonal of the square cancel, leaving f − g together with two constant sin- gular 1 simplices from the left and right edges of the square. By (i) these are boundaries, so f − g is also a boundary. f g v vv v ¾ 1 01 3 2 ¾ 2 f f g g vv 0 1 v 2 (iii) f g ˘ f ‡ g , where f g denotes the product of the paths f and g . For if ˙ : Ñ2!X is the composition of orthogonal projection of Ñ2 … ƒv0;v1;v2⁄ onto the edge ƒv0;v2⁄ followed by f g : ƒv0;v2⁄!X , then @˙ … g − f g ‡ f . (iv) f ˘−f , where f is the inverse path of f . This follows from the preceding three observations, which give f ‡ f ˘ f f ˘ 0. Applying (ii) and (iii) to loops, it follows that we have a well-deﬁned homomor- phism h : ˇ1—X; x0–!H1—X– sending the homotopy class of a loop f to the homology class of the 1 cycle f . Homology and Fundamental Group Section 2.A 167 To show h is surjective when X is path-connected, let P i ni˙i be a 1 cycle rep- resenting a given element of H1—X– . After relabeling the ˙i ’s we may assume each ni is \u00061 . By (iv) we may in fact take each ni to be ‡1 , so our 1 cycle is P i ˙i .If some ˙i is not a loop, then the fact that @(P i ˙i\u0001 … 0 means there must be another ˙j such that the composed path ˙i ˙j is deﬁned. By (iii) we may then combine the terms ˙i and ˙j into a single term ˙i ˙j . Iterating this, we reduce to the case that each ˙i is a loop. Since X is path-connected, we may choose a path γi from x0 to the basepoint of ˙i . We have γi ˙i γi ˘ ˙i by (iii) and (iv), so we may assume all ˙i ’s are loops at x0 . Then we can combine all the ˙i ’s into a single ˙ by (iii). This says the given element of H1—X– is in the image of h . The commutator subgroup of ˇ1—X– is contained in the kernel of h since H1—X– is abelian. To obtain the reverse inclusion we will show that every class ƒf ⁄ in the kernel of h is trivial in the abelianization ˇ1—X–ab of ˇ1—X– . If an element ƒf ⁄ 2 ˇ1—X– is in the kernel of h , then f ,as a 1 cycle, is the bound- ary of a 2 chain P i ni˙i . Again we may assume each ni is \u00061 . As in the discussion preceding Proposition 2.6, we can associate to the chain Pi ni˙i a2 dimensional Ñ complex K by taking a 2 simplex Ñ 2 i for each ˙i and identi- fying certain pairs of edges of these 2 simplices. Namely, if we v 0 v 1 v 2 ¾i ¿ ¿¿ i2 i1 i0 apply the usual boundary formula to write @˙i … ˝i0 − ˝i1 ‡ ˝i2 for singular 1 simplices ˝ij , then the formula f … @(Pi ni˙i\u0001 … P i ni@˙i … P i;j—−1– jni˝ij implies that we can group all but one of the ˝ij ’s into pairs for which the two co- efﬁcients —−1–jni in each pair are ‡1 and −1 . The one remaining ˝ij is equal to f . We then identify edges of the Ñ2 j ’s corresponding to the paired ˝ij ’s, preserving orientations of these edges so that we obtain a Ñ complex K . The maps ˙i ﬁt together to give a map ˙ : K!X . We can deform ˙ , staying ﬁxed on the edge corresponding to f , so that each vertex maps to the basepoint x0 , in the following way. Paths from the images of these vertices to x0 deﬁne such a homotopy on the union of the 0 skeleton of K with the edge corresponding to f , and then we can appeal to the homotopy extension property in Proposition 0.16 to extend this homotopy to all of K . Alternatively, it is not hard to construct such an extension by hand. Restricting the new ˙ to the simplices Ñ 2 i , we obtain a new chain Pi ni˙i with boundary equal to f and with all ˝ij ’s loops at x0 . Using additive notation in the abelian group ˇ1—X–ab , we have the formula ƒf ⁄ … Pi;j—−1– jniƒ˝ij⁄ because of the canceling pairs of ˝ij ’s. We can rewrite the summa- tion Pi;j—−1– jniƒ˝ij⁄ as Pi niƒ@˙i⁄ where ƒ@˙i⁄ … ƒ˝i0⁄ − ƒ˝i1⁄ ‡ ƒ˝i2⁄ . Since ˙i gives a nullhomotopy of the composed loop ˝i0 − ˝i1 ‡ ˝i2 , we conclude that ƒf ⁄ … 0 in ˇ1—X–ab . tu 168 Chapter 2 Homology The end of this proof can be illuminated by looking more closely at the geometry. The complex K is in fact a compact surface with boundary consisting of a single circle formed by the edge corresponding to f . This is because any pattern of identiﬁcations of pairs of edges of a ﬁnite collection of disjoint 2 simplices produces a compact sur- face with boundary. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to check that the algebraic formula f … @(Pi ni˙i\u0001 with each ni …\u00061 implies that K is an orientable surface. The component of K containing the boundary circle is a standard closed orientable surface of some genus g with an open disk removed, by the basic structure theorem for compact orientable surfaces. Giving b f b a a c c d dthis surface the cell structure indicated in the ﬁgure, it then becomes obvious that f is homotopic to a product of g com- mutators in ˇ1—X– . The map h : ˇ1—X; x0–!H1—X– can also be deﬁned by h—ƒf ⁄– … f\u0003—\u000b– where f : S 1!X represents a given element of ˇ1—X; x0– , f\u0003 is the induced map on H1 , and \u000b is the generator of H1—S 1– ˇ Z represented by the standard map ˙ : I!S 1 , ˙—s– … e2ˇis . This is because both ƒf ⁄ 2 ˇ1—X; x0– and f\u0003—\u000b– 2 H1—X– are represented by the loop f˙ : I!X . A consequence of this deﬁnition is that h—ƒf ⁄– … h—ƒg⁄– if f and g are homotopic maps S 1!X , since f\u0003 … g\u0003 by Theorem 2.10. Example 2A.2. For the closed orientable surface M of genus g , the abelianization of ˇ1—M– is Z 2g , the product of 2g copies of Z , and a basis for H1—M– consists of the 1 cycles represented by the 1 cells of M in its standard CW structure. We can also represent a basis by the loops \u000bi and \fi shown in the ﬁgure below since these 1 1 1 ® ¯ 2 2 ® 2® ¯ 3 3 ® ¯ 4 4 ® ¯ ° 2° 3° 0 3® 0 loops are homotopic to the loops represented by the 1 cells, as one can see in the picture of the cell structure in Chapter 0. The loops γi , on the other hand, are trivial in homology since the portion of M on one side of γi is a compact surface bounded by γi ,so γi is homotopic to a loop that is a product of commutators, as we saw a couple paragraphs earlier. The loop \u000b 0 i represents the same homology class as \u000bi since the region between γi and \u000bi [ \u000b0 i ® ° ® 0 i i iprovides a homotopy between γi and a product of two loops homotopic to \u000bi and the inverse of \u000b 0 i ,so \u000bi − \u000b 0 i ˘ γi ˘ 0, hence \u000bi ˘ \u000b 0 i . Classical Applications Section 2.B 169 In this section we use homology theory to prove several interesting results in topology and algebra whose statements give no hint that algebraic topology might be involved. To begin, we calculate the homology of complements of embedded spheres and disks in a sphere. Recall that an embedding is a map that is a homeomorphism onto its image. Proposition 2B.1. (a) For an embedding h : Dk!S n , eHi( S n − h—Dk–\u0001 … 0 for all i . (b) For an embedding h : S k!S n with k<n , eHi( S n − h—S k–\u0001 is Z for i … n − k − 1 and 0 otherwise. As a special case of (b) we have the Jordan curve theorem: A subspace of S 2 homeomorphic to S 1 separates S 2 into two complementary components, or equiv- alently, path-components since open subsets of S n are locally path-connected. One could just as well use R2 in place of S 2 here since deleting a point from an open set in S 2 does not affect its connectedness. More generally, (b) says that a subspace of S n homeomorphic to S n−1 separates it into two components, and these components have the same homology groups as a point. Somewhat surprisingly, there are embed- dings where these complementary components are not simply-connected as they are for the standard embedding. An example is the Alexander horned sphere in S 3 which we describe in detail following the proof of the proposition. These complications in- volving embedded S n−1 ’s in S n are all local in nature since it is known that any locally nicely embedded S n−1 in S n is equivalent to the standard S n−1 ˆ S n , equivalent in the sense that there is a homeomorphism of S n taking the given embedded S n−1 onto the standard S n−1 . In particular, both complementary regions are homeomorphic to open balls. See [Brown 1960] for a precise statement and proof. When n … 2 itisa classical theorem of Schoenﬂies that all embeddings S 1 > S 2 are equivalent. By contrast, when we come to embeddings of S n−2 in S n , even locally nice embed- dings need not be equivalent to the standard one. This is the subject of knot theory, including the classical case of knotted embeddings of S 1 in S 3 or R 3 . For embeddings of S n−2 in S n the complement always has the same homology as S 1 , according to the theorem, but the fundamental group can be quite different. In spite of the fact that the homology of a knot complement does not detect knottedness, it is still possible to use homology to distinguish different knots by looking at the homology of covering spaces of their complements. Proof: We prove (a) by induction on k . When k … 0, S n − h—D0– is homeomorphic to Rn , so this case is trivial. For the induction step it will be convenient to replace the domain disk Dk of h by the cube Ik . Let A … S n − h—Ik−1 \u0002 ƒ0; 1=2⁄– and let 170 Chapter 2 Homology B … S n − h—Ik−1 \u0002 ƒ1=2; 1⁄–,so A \\ B … Sn − h—Ik– and A [ B … S n − h—Ik−1 \u0002f1=2g–.By induction eHi—A [ B– … 0 for all i , so the Mayer–Vietoris sequence gives isomorphisms Ø : eHi( S n − h—Ik–\u0001 ! eHi—A–\b eHi—B– for all i . Modulo signs, the two components of Ø are induced by the inclusions S n − h—Ik– > A and S n − h—Ik– > B , so if there exists an i dimensional cycle \u000b in S n − h—Ik– that is not a boundary in S n − h—Ik– , then \u000b is also not a boundary in at least one of A and B . (When i … 0 the word ‘cycle’ here is to be interpreted in the sense of augmented chain complexes since we are dealing with reduced homology.) By iteration we can then produce a nested sequence of closed intervals I1 ˙ I2 ˙\u0001\u0001\u0001 in the last coordinate of Ik shrinking down to a point p 2 I , such that \u000b is not a boundary in S n − h—Ik−1 \u0002 Im– for any m .On the other hand, by induction on k we know that \u000b is the boundary of a chain \f in S n − h—Ik−1 \u0002fpg– . This \f is a ﬁnite linear combination of singular simplices with compact image in S n − h—Ik−1 \u0002fpg– . The union of these images is covered by the nested sequence of open sets S n − h—Ik−1 \u0002 Im– , so by compactness \f must actually be a chain in S n − h—Ik−1 \u0002 Im– for some m . This contradiction shows that \u000b must be a boundary in S n − h—Ik– , ﬁnishing the induction step. Part (b) is also proved by induction on k , starting with the trivial case k … 0 when S n − h—S 0– is homeomorphic to S n−1 \u0002 R . For the induction step, write S k as the union of hemispheres Dk ‡ and Dk − intersecting in S k−1 . The Mayer–Vietoris sequence for A … S n −h—Dk ‡– and B … S n −h—Dk −– , both of which have trivial reduced homology by part (a), then gives isomorphisms eHi( S n − h—Dk–\u0001 ˇ eHi‡1( S n − h—S k−1–\u0001 . tu If we apply the last part of this proof to an embedding h : S n!S n , the Mayer- Vietoris sequence ends with the terms eH0—A–\b eH0—B–! eH0( S n − h—S n−1–\u0001 !0 . Both eH0—A– and eH0—B– are zero, so exactness would imply that eH0( S n − h—S n−1–\u0001 … 0 which appears to contradict the fact that S n − h—S n−1– has two path-components. The only way out of this dilemma is for h to be surjective, so that A \\ B is empty and the 0 at the end of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence is eH−1—;– which is Z rather than 0 . In particular, this shows that S n cannot be embedded in R n since this would yield a nonsurjective embedding in S n . A consequence is that there is no embedding Rm > R n for m> n since this would restrict to an embedding of S n ˆ R m into R n . More generally there is no continuous injection Rm!R n for m> n since this too would give an embedding S n > R n . Example 2B.2: The Alexander Horned Sphere. This is a subspace S ˆ R 3 homeo- morphic to S 2 such that the unbounded component of R 3 −S is not simply-connected as it is for the standard S 2 ˆ R 3 . We will construct S by deﬁning a sequence of com- pact subspaces X0 ˙ X1 ˙ \u0001\u0001\u0001 of R 3 whose intersection is homeomorphic to a ball, and then S will be the boundary sphere of this ball. We begin with X0 a solid torus S 1 \u0002 D2 obtained from a ball B0 by attaching a handle I \u0002 D2 along @I \u0002 D2 . In the ﬁgure this handle is shown as the union of Classical Applications Section 2.B 171 two ‘horns’ attached to the ball, together with a shorter handle drawn as dashed lines. To form the space X1 ˆ X0 we delete part of the short handle, so that what remains is a pair of linked handles attached to the ball B1 that is the union of B0 with the two horns. To form X2 the process is repeated: Decompose each of the second stage handles as a pair of horns and a short handle, then delete a part of the short handle. In the same way Xn is constructed in- ductively from Xn−1 . Thus Xn is a ball Bn with 2n handles attached, and Bn is obtained from Bn−1 by attaching 2 n horns. There are homeo- morphisms hn : Bn−1!Bn that are the identity outside a small neighborhood of Bn − Bn−1 .As n goes to inﬁnity, the composition hn \u0001\u0001\u0001 h1 approaches a map f : B0!R 3 which is continuous since the convergence is uniform. The set of points in B0 where f is not equal to hn \u0001\u0001\u0001 h1 for large n is a Cantor set, whose image under f is the intersection of all the handles. It is not hard to see that f is one-to-one. By compactness it follows that f is a homeomorphism onto its image, a ball B ˆ R3 whose boundary sphere f—@B0– is S , the Alexander horned sphere. Now we compute ˇ1—R 3 −B– . Note that B is the intersection of the Xn ’s, so R 3 −B is the union of the complements Yn of the Xn ’s, which form an increasing sequence Y0 ˆ Y1 ˆ \u0001\u0001\u0001 . We will show that the groups ˇ1—Yn– also form an increasing sequence of successively larger groups, whose union is ˇ1—R 3−B– . To begin we have ˇ1—Y0– ˇ Z since X0 is a solid torus embedded in R 3 in a standard way. To compute ˇ1—Y1– , let Y 0 be the closure of Y0 in Y1 ,so Y 0 − Y0 is an open annulus A and ˇ1—Y 0– is also Z . We obtain Y1 from Y 0 by attaching the space Z … Y1 − Y0 along A . The group ˇ1—Z– is the free group F2 on two generators \u000b1 and \u000b2 represented by loops linking the two handles, since Z − A is homeomorphic to an open ball with two straight tubes deleted. A loop \u000b generating ˇ1—A– represents the commutator ƒ\u000b1;\u000b2⁄ , as one can see by noting that the closure of Z is obtained from Z by adjoining two disjoint surfaces, each homeomorphic to a torus with an open disk removed; the boundary of this disk is homotopic to \u000b and is also homotopic to the commutator of meridian and longitude circles in the torus, which correspond to \u000b1 and \u000b2 . Van Kampen’s theorem now implies that the inclusion Y0 > Y1 induces an injection of ˇ1—Y0– into ˇ1—Y1– as the inﬁnite cyclic subgroup generated by ƒ\u000b1;\u000b2⁄ . In a similar way we can regard Yn‡1 as being obtained from Yn by adjoining 2 n copies of Z . Assuming inductively that ˇ1—Yn– is the free group F2n with generators represented by loops linking the 2n smallest handles of Xn , then each copy of Z ad- 172 Chapter 2 Homology joined to Yn changes ˇ1—Yn– by making one of the generators into the commutator of two new generators. Note that adjoining a copy of Z induces an injection on ˇ1 since the induced homomorphism is the free product of the injection ˇ1—A–!ˇ1—Z– with the identity map on the complementary free factor. Thus the map ˇ1—Yn–!ˇ1—Yn‡1– is an injection F2n!F2n‡1 . The group ˇ1—R 3 − B– is isomorphic to the union of this increasing sequence of groups by a compactness argument: Each loop in R 3 − B has compact image and hence must lie in some Yn , and similarly for homotopies of loops. In particular we see explicitly why ˇ1—R 3 − B– has trivial abelianization, because each of its generators is exactly equal to the commutator of two other generators. This inductive construction in which each generator of a free group is decreed to be the commutator of two new generators is perhaps the simplest way of building a nontrivial group with trivial abelianization, and for the construction to have such a nice geometric interpretation is something to marvel at. From a naive viewpoint it may seem a little odd that a highly nonfree group can be built as a union of an increasing sequence of free groups, but this can also easily happen for abelian groups, as Q for example is the union of an increasing sequence of inﬁnite cyclic subgroups. The next theorem says that for subspaces of Rn , the property of being open is a topological invariant. This result is known classically as Invariance of Domain, the word ‘domain’ being an older designation for an open set in R n . Theorem 2B.3. If U is an open set in R n then for any embedding h : U!R n the image h—U– must be an open set in Rn . Proof: Regarding S n as the one-point compactiﬁcation of R n , an equivalent statement is that h—U– is open in S n , and this is what we will prove. Each x 2 U is the center point of a disk Dn ˆ U . It will sufﬁce to prove that h—Dn − @Dn– is open in S n . By the previous proposition S n − h—@Dn– has two path-components. These path- components are h—Dn − @Dn– and S n − h—Dn– since these two subspaces are disjoint and the ﬁrst is path-connected since it is homeomorphic to Dn −@Dn while the second is path-connected by the proposition. Since S n − h—@Dn– is open in S n , its path- components are the same as its components. The components of a space with ﬁnitely many components are open, so h—Dn − @Dn– is open in S n − h—@Dn– and hence also in S n . tu Here is an application involving the notion of an n manifold, which is a Hausdorff space locally homeomorphic to Rn : Corollary 2B.4. If M is a compact n manifold and N is a connected n manifold, then an embedding h : M!N must be surjective, hence a homeomorphism. Proof: h—M– is closed in N since it is compact and N is Hausdorff. Since N is connected it sufﬁces to show h—M– is also open in N , and this is immediate from the theorem. tu Classical Applications Section 2.B 173 The Invariance of Domain and the n dimensional generalization of the Jordan curve theorem were ﬁrst proved by Brouwer around 1910, at a very early stage in the development of algebraic topology. Division Algebras Here is an algebraic application of homology theory due to H. Hopf: Theorem 2B.5. R and C are the only ﬁnite-dimensional division algebras over R which are commutative and have an identity. By deﬁnition, an algebra structure on R n is simply a bilinear multiplication map Rn \u0002 R n!R n , —a; b– , ab . Thus the product satisﬁes left and right distributivity, a—b ‡c– … ab ‡ac and —a ‡b–c … ac ‡bc , and scalar associativity, \u000b—ab– … —\u000ba–b … a—\u000bb– for \u000b 2 R . Commutativity, full associativity, and an identity element are not assumed. An algebra is a division algebra if the equations ax … b and xa … b are always solvable whenever a ﬂ 0 . In other words, the linear transformations x , ax and x,xa are surjective when a ﬂ 0 . These are linear maps R n!Rn , so surjectivity is equivalent to having trivial kernel, which means there are no zero-divisors. The four classical examples are R , C , the quaternions H , and the octonions O . Frobenius proved in 1877 that R , C , and H are the only ﬁnite-dimensional associative division algebras over R , and in 1898 Hurwitz proved that these three together with O are the only ﬁnite-dimensional division algebras over R with a product satisfying jabj…jajjbj . See [Ebbinghaus 1991]. We will show in Theorem 3.20 that a ﬁnite- dimensional division algebra over R must have dimension a power of 2 . In fact the only possible dimensions are 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 , as in the classical examples. The ﬁrst proofs of this appeared in [Bott & Milnor 1958] and [Kervaire 1958]. A very nice proof using K–theory is in [Adams & Atiyah 1966], and an exposition of this can be found in [VBKT]. See x4.B for further comments. It still appears that the only known proofs of this seemingly algebraic result are topological. Proof: Suppose ﬁrst that R n has a commutative division algebra structure. Deﬁne a map f : S n−1!S n−1 by f—x– … x2=jx2j . This is well-deﬁned since x ﬂ 0 implies x2 ﬂ 0 in a division algebra. The map f is continuous since the multiplication map Rn \u0002 R n!R n is bilinear, hence continuous. Since f—−x– … f—x– for all x , f induces a quotient map f : RPn−1!S n−1 . The following argument shows that f is injective. An equality f—x– … f—y– implies x2 … \u000b 2y 2 for \u000b … —jx2j=jy 2j– 1=2 > 0 . Thus we have x2 − \u000b 2y 2 … 0 , which factors as —x ‡ \u000by–—x − \u000by– … 0 using commutativity and the fact that \u000b is a real scalar. Since there are no divisors of zero, we deduce that x …\u0006\u000by . Since x and y are unit vectors and \u000b is real, this yields x …\u0006y ,so x and y determine the same point of RPn−1 , which means that f is injective. Since f is an injective map of compact Hausdorff spaces, it must be a homeo- morphism onto its image. By Corollary 2B.4, f must in fact be surjective if we are 174 Chapter 2 Homology not in the trivial case n … 1 . Thus we have a homeomorphism RPn−1 ˇ S n−1 . This implies n … 2 since if n> 2 the spaces RPn−1 and S n−1 have different homology groups (or different fundamental groups). It remains to show that a 2 dimensional commutative division algebra A with identity is isomorphic to C . This is elementary algebra: If j 2 A is not a real scalar multiple of the identity element 1 2 A and we write j2 … a ‡ bj for a; b 2 R , then —j − b=2–2 … a ‡ b2=4 so by rechoosing j we may assume that j2 … a 2 R .If a \u0015 0, say a … c2 , then j2 … c2 implies —j ‡ c–—j − c– … 0, so j …\u0006c , but this contradicts the choice of j .So j2 …−c2 and by rescaling j we may assume j2 …−1 , hence A is isomorphic to C . tu Leaving out the last paragraph, the proof shows that a ﬁnite-dimensional com- mutative division algebra, not necessarily with an identity, must have dimension at most 2 . Oddly enough, there do exist 2 dimensional commutative division algebras without identity elements, for example C with the modiﬁed multiplication z\u0001w … zw , the bar denoting complex conjugation. The Borsuk–Ulam Theorem In Theorem 1.10 we proved the 2 dimensional case of the Borsuk–Ulam theorem, and now we will give a proof for all dimensions, using the following theorem of Borsuk: Proposition 2B.6. An odd map f : S n!S n , satisfying f—−x– …−f—x– for all x , must have odd degree. The corresponding result that even maps have even degree is easier, and was an exercise for x2.2. The proof will show that using homology with a coefﬁcient group other than Z can sometimes be a distinct advantage. The main ingredient will be a certain exact sequence associated to a two-sheeted covering space p : eX!X , \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Hn—X; Z2– ˝\u0003-----! Hn— eX; Z2– p\u0003-----! Hn—X; Z2– -! Hn−1—X; Z2– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 This is the long exact sequence of homology groups associated to a short exact se- quence of chain complexes consisting of short exact sequences of chain groups 0 -! Cn—X; Z2– ˝-----! Cn— eX; Z2– p]-----! Cn—X; Z2– -! 0 The map p] is surjective since singular simplices ˙ : Ñ n!X always lift to eX ,as Ñn is simply-connected. Each ˙ has in fact precisely two lifts e˙1 and e˙2 . Because we are using Z2 coefﬁcients, the kernel of p] is generated by the sums e˙1 ‡ e˙2 . Soifwe deﬁne ˝ to send each ˙ : Ñn!X to the sum of its two lifts to eÑ n , then the image of ˝ is the kernel of p] . Obviously ˝ is injective, so we have the short exact sequence indicated. Since ˝ and p] commute with boundary maps, we have a short exact sequence of chain complexes, yielding the long exact sequence of homology groups. Classical Applications Section 2.B 175 The map ˝\u0003 is a special case of more general transfer homomorphisms considered in x3.G, so we will refer to the long exact sequence involving the maps ˝\u0003 as the transfer sequence. This sequence can also be viewed as a special case of the Gysin sequences discussed in x4.D. There is a generalization of the transfer sequence to homology with other coefﬁcients, but this uses a more elaborate form of homology called homology with local coefﬁcients, as we show in x3.H. Proof of 2B.6: The proof will involve the transfer sequence for the covering space p : S n!RPn . This has the following form, where to simplify notation we abbreviate RPn to P n and we let the coefﬁcient group Z2 be implicit: ¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!H 0 0 P nn ()SH () p ¡¡¡!¡¡¡!PH0 () n nn ¤¤ ¼ ¡¡¡!PH () n n ¼ -n 1 ¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!H 00 P n()¡¡¡!PH () n i ¼ -i 1 ¿ ¡¡¡!¡¡¡!H 0 0 P nn ()PH ()¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!PH0 () n ¼ ¡¡¡!SH () n ¼ p 1 000 ¤ ... ...¡¡¡!... ... The initial 0 is Hn‡1—P n; Z2– , which vanishes since P n is an n dimensional CW com- plex. The other terms that are zero are Hi—S n– for 0 <i<n . We assume n> 1, leaving the minor modiﬁcations needed for the case n … 1 to the reader. All the terms that are not zero are Z2 , by cellular homology. Alternatively, this exact sequence can be used to compute the homology groups Hi—RPn; Z2– if one does not already know them. Since all the nonzero groups in the sequence are Z2 , exactness forces the maps to be isomorphisms or zero as indicated. An odd map f : S n!S n induces a quotient map f : RPn!RPn . These two maps induce a map from the transfer sequence to itself, and we will need to know that the squares in the resulting diagram commute. This follows from the naturality of the long exact sequence of homology associated to a short exact sequence of chain complexes, once we verify commutativity of the diagram¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!PC0 ()¡¡¡¡¡!C 0iii n P nn ()SC () ¿ ]p ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!PC0 () C 0iii n P nn ()SC () ¿ ]p ]f ]f]f¡¡ Here the right-hand square commutes since pf … fp . The left-hand square com- mutes since for a singular i simplex ˙ : Ñ i!P n with lifts e˙1 and e˙2 , the two lifts of f˙ are f e˙1 and f e˙2 since f takes antipodal points to antipodal points. Now we can see that all the maps f\u0003 and f \u0003 in the commutative diagram of transfer sequences are isomorphisms by induction on dimension, using the evident fact that if three maps in a commutative square are isomorphisms, so is the fourth. The induction starts with the trivial fact that f\u0003 and f \u0003 are isomorphisms in dimen- sion zero. 176 Chapter 2 Homology In particular we deduce that the map f\u0003 : Hn—S n; Z2–!Hn—S n; Z2– is an isomor- phism. By Lemma 2.49 this map is multiplication by the degree of f mod 2 , so the degree of f must be odd. tu The fact that odd maps have odd degree easily implies the Borsuk–Ulam theorem: Corollary 2B.7. For every map g : S n!R n there exists a point x 2 S n with g—x– … g—−x– . Proof: Let f—x– … g—x– − g—−x– ,so f is odd. We need to show that f—x– … 0 for some x . If this is not the case, we can replace f—x– by f—x–=jf—x–j to get a new map f : S n!S n−1 which is still odd. The restriction of this f to the equator S n−1 then has odd degree by the proposition. But this restriction is nullhomotopic via the restriction of f to one of the hemispheres bounded by S n−1 . tu Exercises 1.

Many spaces of interest in algebraic topology can be given the structure of sim- plicial complexes, and early in the history of the subject this structure was exploited as one of the main technical tools. Later, CW complexes largely superseded simplicial complexes in this role, but there are still some occasions when the extra structure of simplicial complexes can be quite useful. This will be illustrated nicely by the proof of the classical Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem in this section. One of the good features of simplicial complexes is that arbitrary continuous maps between them can always be deformed to maps that are linear on the simplices of some subdivision of the domain complex. This is the idea of ‘simplicial approxi- mation,’ developed by Brouwer and Alexander before 1920. Here is the relevant def- inition: If K and L are simplicial complexes, then a map f : K!L is simplicial if it sends each simplex of K to a simplex of L by a linear map taking vertices to ver- tices. In barycentric coordinates, a linear map of a simplex ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ has the form Pi tivi , P i tif—vi– . Since a linear map from a simplex to a simplex is uniquely determined by its values on vertices, this means that a simplicial map is uniquely determined by its values on vertices. It is easy to see that a map from the vertices of K to the vertices of L extends to a simplicial map iff it sends the vertices of each simplex of K to the vertices of some simplex of L . Here is the most basic form of the Simplicial Approximation Theorem: Theorem 2C.1. If K is a ﬁnite simplicial complex and L is an arbitrary simplicial complex, then any map f : K!L is homotopic to a map that is simplicial with respect to some iterated barycentric subdivision of K . 178 Chapter 2 Homology To see that subdivision of K is essential, consider the case of maps Sn!S n . With ﬁxed simplicial structures on the domain and range spheres there are only ﬁnitely many simplicial maps since there are only ﬁnitely many ways to map vertices to ver- tices. Hence only ﬁnitely many degrees are realized by maps that are simplicial with respect to ﬁxed simplicial structures in both the domain and range spheres. This re- mains true even if the simplicial structure on the range sphere is allowed to vary, since if the range sphere has more vertices than the domain sphere then the map cannot be surjective, hence must have degree zero. Before proving the simplicial approximation theorem we need some terminology and a lemma. The star St ˙ of a simplex ˙ in a simplicial complex X is deﬁned to be the subcomplex consisting of all the simplices of X that contain ˙ . Closely related to this is the open star st ˙ , which is the union of the interiors of all simplices containing ˙ , where the interior of a simplex ˝ is by deﬁnition ˝ − @˝ . Thus st ˙ is an open set in X whose closure is St ˙ . Lemma 2C.2. For vertices v1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn of a simplicial complex X , the intersection st v1 \\\u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ st vn is empty unless v1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn are the vertices of a simplex ˙ of X , in which case st v1 \\\u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ st vn … st ˙ . Proof: The intersection st v1 \\\u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ st vn consists of the interiors of all simplices ˝ whose vertex set contains fv1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vng .If st v1 \\\u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ st vn is nonempty, such a ˝ exists and contains the simplex ˙ … ƒv1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ ˆ X . The simplices ˝ containing fv1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vng are just the simplices containing ˙ ,so st v1 \\\u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ st vn … st ˙ . tu Proof of 2C.1: Choose a metric on K that restricts to the standard Euclidean metric on each simplex of K . For example, K can be viewed as a subcomplex of a sim- plex ÑN whose vertices are all the vertices of K , and we can restrict a standard met- ric on ÑN to give a metric on K . Let \" be a Lebesgue number for the open cover f f −1( st w\u0001 j w is a vertex of L g of K . After iterated barycentric subdivision of K we may assume that each simplex has diameter less than \"=2 . The closed star of each vertex v of K then has diameter less than \" , hence this closed star maps by f to the open star of some vertex g—v– of L . The resulting map g : K0!L0 thus satisﬁes f—St v– ˆ st g—v– for all vertices v of K . To see that g extends to a simplicial map g : K!L , consider the problem of extending g over a simplex ƒv1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ of K . An interior point x of this simplex lies in st vi for each i ,so f—x– lies in st g—vi– for each i , since f—st vi– ˆ st g—vi– by the deﬁnition of g—vi– . Thus st g—v1– \\\u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ st g—vn– ﬂ ; ,so ƒg—v1–; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;g—vn–⁄ is a simplex of L by the lemma, and we can extend g linearly over ƒv1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ . Both f—x– and g—x– lie in a single simplex of L since g—x– lies in ƒg—v1–; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;g—vn–⁄ and f—x– lies in the star of this simplex. So taking the linear path —1−t–f —x–‡tg—x– ,0 \u0014 t \u0014 1, in the simplex containing f—x– and g—x– deﬁnes a homotopy from f to g . To check continuity of this homotopy it sufﬁces to restrict to the simplex ƒv1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ , where Simplicial Approximation Section 2.C 179 continuity is clear since f—x– varies continuously in the star of ƒg—v1–; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;g—vn–⁄ and g—x– varies continuously in ƒg—v1–; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;g—vn–⁄ . tu Notice that if f already sends some vertices of K to vertices of L then we may choose g to equal to f on these vertices, and hence the homotopy from f to g will be stationary on these vertices. This is convenient if one is in a situation where one wants maps and homotopies to preserve basepoints. The proof makes it clear that the simplicial approximation g can be chosen not just homotopic to f but also close to f if we allow subdivisions of L as well as K . The Lefschetz Fixed Point Theorem This very classical application of homology is a considerable generalization of the Brouwer ﬁxed point theorem. It is also related to the Euler characteristic formula. For a homomorphism ' : Z n!Z n with matrix ƒaij⁄ , the trace tr ' is deﬁned to be Pi aii , the sum of the diagonal elements of ƒaij⁄ . Since tr—ƒaij⁄ƒbij⁄– … tr—ƒbij⁄ƒaij⁄– , conjugate matrices have the same trace, and it follows that tr ' is in- dependent of the choice of basis for Z n . For a homomorphism ' : A!A of a ﬁnitely generated abelian group A we can then deﬁne tr ' to be the trace of the induced homomorphism ' : A=Torsion!A=Torsion . For a map f : X!X of a ﬁnite CW complex X , or more generally any space whose homology groups are ﬁnitely generated and vanish in high dimensions, the Lefschetz number ˝—f – is deﬁned to be P n—−1– n tr( f\u0003 : Hn—X–!Hn—X–\u0001 . In particular, if f is the identity, or is homotopic to the identity, then ˝—f – is the Euler characteristic ˜ —X– since the trace of the n\u0002 n identity matrix is n . Here is the Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem: Theorem 2C.3. If X is a ﬁnite simplicial complex, or more generally a retract of a ﬁnite simplicial complex, and f : X!X is a map with ˝—f – ﬂ 0 , then f has a ﬁxed point. As we show in Theorem A.7 in the Appendix, every compact, locally contractible space that can be embedded in Rn for some n is a retract of a ﬁnite simplicial com- plex. This includes compact manifolds and ﬁnite CW complexes, for example. The compactness hypothesis is essential, since a translation of R has ˝ … 1 but no ﬁxed points. For an example showing that local properties are also signiﬁcant, let X be the compact subspace of R 2 consisting of two concentric circles together with a copy of R between them whose two ends spiral in to the two circles, wrapping around them inﬁnitely often, and let f : X!X be a homeomorphism translating the copy of R along itself and rotating the circles, with no ﬁxed points. Since f is homotopic to the identity, we have ˝—f – … ˜ —X– , which equals 1 since the three path components of X are two circles and a line. 180 Chapter 2 Homology If X has the same homology groups as a point, at least modulo torsion, then the theorem says that every map X!X has a ﬁxed point. This holds for exam- ple for RPn if n is even. The case of projective spaces is interesting because of its connection with linear algebra. An invertible linear transformation f : R n!R n takes lines through 0 to lines through 0 , hence induces a map f : RPn−1!RPn−1 . Fixed points of f are equivalent to eigenvectors of f . The characteristic polyno- mial of f has odd degree if n is odd, hence has a real root, so an eigenvector ex- ists in this case. This is in agreement with the observation above that every map RP2k!RP2k has a ﬁxed point. On the other hand the rotation of R 2k deﬁned by f—x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x2k– … —x2; −x1;x4; −x3; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x2k; −x2k−1– has no eigenvectors and its pro- jectivization f : RP2k−1!RP2k−1 has no ﬁxed points. Similarly, in the complex case an invertible linear transformation f : C n!C n in- duces f : CPn−1!CPn−1 , and this always has a ﬁxed point since the characteristic polynomial always has a complex root. Nevertheless, as in the real case there is a map CP2k−1!CP2k−1 without ﬁxed points. Namely, consider f : C 2k!C 2k deﬁned by f—z1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;z2k– … —z2; −z1; z4; −z3; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; z2k; −z2k−1– . This map is only ‘conjugate- linear’ over C , but this is still good enough to imply that f induces a well-deﬁned map f on CP2k−1 , and it is easy to check that f has no ﬁxed points. The similarity between the real and complex cases persists in the fact that every map CP2k!CP2k has a ﬁxed point, though to deduce this from the Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem re- quires more structure than homology has, so this will be left as an exercise for x3.2, using cup products in cohomology. One could go further and consider the quaternionic case. The antipodal map of S 4 … HP1 has no ﬁxed points, but every map HPn!HPn with n> 1 does have a ﬁxed point. This is shown in Example 4L.4 using considerably heavier machinery. Proof of 2C.3: The general case easily reduces to the case of ﬁnite simplicial com- plexes, for suppose r : K!X is a retraction of the ﬁnite simplicial complex K onto X . For a map f : X!X , the composition fr : K!X ˆ K then has exactly the same ﬁxed points as f . Since r\u0003 : Hn—K–!Hn—X– is projection onto a direct summand, we clearly have tr—f\u0003r\u0003– … tr f\u0003 ,so ˝—f\u0003r\u0003– … ˝—f\u0003– . For X a ﬁnite simplicial complex, suppose that f : X!X has no ﬁxed points. We claim there is a subdivision L of X , a further subdivision K of L , and a simplicial map g : K!L homotopic to f such that g—˙ –\\˙ …; for each simplex ˙ of K . To see this, ﬁrst choose a metric d on X as in the proof of the simplicial approximation theorem. Since f has no ﬁxed points, d ( x; f —x– \u0001 > 0 for all x 2 X , so by the compactness of X there is an \"> 0 such that d ( x; f —x– \u0001 >\" for all x . Choose a subdivision L of X so that the stars of all simplices have diameter less than \"=2 . Applying the simplicial approximation theorem, there is a subdivision K of L and a simplicial map g : K!L homotopic to f . By construction, g has the property that for each simplex ˙ of K , f—˙ – is contained in the star of the simplex g—˙ – . Then g—˙ – \\ ˙ …; Simplicial Approximation Section 2.C 181 for each simplex ˙ of K since for any choice of x 2 ˙ we have d ( x; f —x– \u0001 >\" , while g—˙ – lies within distance \"=2of f—x– and ˙ lies within distance \"=2of x ,as a consequence of the fact that ˙ is contained in a simplex of L , K being a subdivision of L . The Lefschetz numbers ˝—f – and ˝—g– are equal since f and g are homotopic. Since g is simplicial, it takes the n skeleton Kn of K to the n skeleton Ln of L , for each n . Since K is a subdivision of L , Ln is contained in Kn , and hence g—Kn– ˆ Kn for all n . Thus g induces a chain map of the cellular chain complex fHn—Kn;Kn−1–g to itself. This can be used to compute ˝—g– according to the formula ˝—g– … X n —−1– n tr( g\u0003 : Hn—Kn;Kn−1–!Hn—Kn;Kn−1–\u0001 This is the analog of Theorem 2.44 for trace instead of rank, and is proved in precisely the same way, based on the elementary algebraic fact that trace is additive for endo- morphisms of short exact sequences: Given a com- mutative diagram as at the right with exact rows, 0 A ® ¯ °¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡! B¡¡¡! C¡¡¡! 0¡¡! 0 A¡¡! B¡¡¡! C¡¡¡! 0¡¡! then tr \f … tr \u000b ‡ tr γ . This algebraic fact can be proved by reducing to the easy case that A , B , and C are free by ﬁrst factoring out the torsion in B , hence also the torsion in A , then eliminating any remaining torsion in C by replacing A by a larger subgroup A 0 ˆ B , with A having ﬁnite index in A0 . The details of this argument are left to the reader. Finally, note that g\u0003 : Hn—Kn;Kn−1–!Hn—Kn;Kn−1– has trace 0 since the matrix for g\u0003 has zeros down the diagonal, in view of the fact that g—˙ – \\ ˙ …; for each n simplex ˙ .So ˝—f – … ˝—g– … 0. tu Example 2C.4. Let us verify the theorem in an example. Let X be the closed ori- entable surface of genus 3 as shown in the ﬁgure below, with f : X!X the 180 degree rotation about a vertical axis passing through the central hole of X . Since f has no ﬁxed points, we 1 1 ® ¯ 2 2 ® 2® ¯ 3 3 ® ¯ 0 should have ˝—f – … 0 . The induced map f\u0003 : H0—X–!H0—X– is the iden- tity, as always for a path-connected space, so this contributes 1 to ˝—f – . For H1—X– we saw in Example 2A.2 that the six loops \u000bi and \fi represent a basis. The map f\u0003 interchanges the homology classes of \u000b1 and \u000b3 , and likewise for \f1 and \f3 , while \f2 is sent to itself and \u000b2 is sent to \u000b 0 2 which is homologous to \u000b2 as we saw in Example 2A.2. So f\u0003 : H1—X–!H1—X– contributes −2to ˝—f – . It remains to check that f\u0003 : H2—X–!H2—X– is the iden- tity, which we do by the commutative diagram at the right, where x is a point of X in the cen-¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! XH2() X xXH2()}{, - X yXH2()}{, - f¤ f¤ ¼¡¡¡¡¡!XH2() ¼ tral torus and y … f—x– . We can see that the 182 Chapter 2 Homology left-hand vertical map is an isomorphism by considering the long exact sequence of the triple —X; X −fxg;X1– where X1 is the 1 skeleton of X in its usual CW struc- ture and x is chosen in X − X1 , so that X −fxg deformation retracts onto X1 and Hn—X −fxg;X1– … 0 for all n . The same reasoning shows the right-hand vertical map is an isomorphism. There is a similar commutative diagram with f replaced by a homeomorphism g that is homotopic to the identity and equals f in a neighbor- hood of x , with g the identity outside a disk in X containing x and y . Since g is homotopic to the identity, it induces the identity across the top row of the diagram, and since g equals f near x , it induces the same map as f in the bottom row of the diagram, by excision. It follows that the map f\u0003 in the upper row is the identity. This example generalizes to surfaces of any odd genus by adding symmetric pairs of tori at the left and right. Examples for even genus are described in one of the exercises. Fixed point theory is a well-developed side branch of algebraic topology, but we touch upon it only occasionally in this book. For a nice introduction see [Brown 1971]. Simplicial Approximations to CW Complexes The simplicial approximation theorem allows arbitrary continuous maps to be replaced by homotopic simplicial maps in many situations, and one might wonder about the analogous question for spaces: Which spaces are homotopy equivalent to simplicial complexes ? We will show this is true for the most common class of spaces in algebraic topology, CW complexes. In the Appendix the question is answered for a few other classes of spaces as well. Theorem 2C.5. Every CW complex X is homotopy equivalent to a simplicial complex, which can be chosen to be of the same dimension as X , ﬁnite if X is ﬁnite, and countable if X is countable. We will build a simplicial complex Y ' X inductively as an increasing union of subcomplexes Yn homotopy equivalent to the skeleta Xn . For the inductive step, assuming we have already constructed Yn ' Xn , let en‡1 be an —n ‡ 1– cell of X attached by a map ' : S n!Xn . The map S n!Yn corresponding to ' under the homotopy equivalence Yn ' Xn is homotopic to a simplicial map f : S n!Yn by the simplicial approximation theorem, and it is not hard to see that the spaces Xn [' en‡1 and Yn [f en‡1 are homotopy equivalent, where the subscripts denote attaching en‡1 via ' and f , respectively; see Proposition 0.18 for a proof. We can view Yn [f en‡1 as the mapping cone Cf , obtained from the mapping cylinder of f by collapsing the domain end to a point. If we knew that the mapping cone of a simplicial map was a simplicial complex, then by performing the same construction for all the —n ‡ 1– cells of X we would have completed the induction step. Unfortunately, and somewhat surprisingly, mapping cones and mapping cylinders are rather awkward objects in the Simplicial Approximation Section 2.C 183 simplicial category. To avoid this awkwardness we will instead construct simplicial analogs of mapping cones and cylinders that have all the essential features of actual mapping cones and cylinders. Let us ﬁrst construct the simplicial analog of a mapping cylinder. For a simpli- cial map f : K!L this will be a simplicial complex M—f – containing both L and the barycentric subdivision K0 of K as subcomplexes, and such that there is a deformation retraction rt of M—f – onto L with r1 jj K0 … f . The ﬁgure shows the case that f is a simplicial surjection Ñ2!Ñ1 . The construction proceeds one simplex of K at a time, by induction on dimension. To begin, the ordinary mapping cylinder of f : K0!L sufﬁces for M—f jj K0– . Assume inductively that we have already constructed M—f jj Kn−1– . Let ˙ be an n simplex of K and let ˝ … f—˙ – , a simplex of L of dimension n or less. By the inductive hy- pothesis we have already constructed M—f : @˙!˝– with the desired properties, and we let M—f : ˙!˝– be the cone on M—f : @˙!˝– , as shown in the ﬁgure. The space M—f : @˙!˝– is contractible since by induction it deformation retracts onto ˝ which is contractible. The cone M—f : ˙!˝– is of course contractible, so the inclusion of M—f : @˙!˝– into M—f : ˙!˝– is a homotopy equivalence. This implies that M—f : ˙!˝– deformation retracts onto M—f : @˙!˝– by Corollary 0.20, or one can give a direct argument using the fact that M—f : @˙!˝– is contractible. By attaching M—f : ˙!˝– to M—f jj Kn−1– along M—f : @˙!˝– ˆ M—f jj Kn−1– for all n simplices ˙ of K we obtain M—f jj Kn– with a deformation retraction onto M—f jj Kn−1– . Tak- ing the union over all n yields M—f – with a deformation retraction rt onto L , the inﬁnite concatenation of the previous deformation retractions, with the deformation retraction of M—f jj Kn– onto M—f jj Kn−1– performed in the t interval ƒ1=2 n‡1; 1=2 n⁄ . The map r1 jj K may not equal f , but it is homotopic to f via the linear homotopy tf ‡—1−t–r1 , which is deﬁned since r1—˙ – ˆ f—˙ – for all simplices ˙ of K . By apply- ing the homotopy extension property to the homotopy of r1 that equals tf ‡ —1 − t–r1 on K and the identity map on L , we can improve our deformation retraction of M—f – onto L so that its restriction to K at time 1 is f . From the simplicial analog M—f – of a mapping cylinder we construct the simpli- cial ‘mapping cone’ C—f – by attaching the ordinary cone on K0 to the subcomplex K0 ˆ M—f – . Proof of 2C.5: We will construct for each n a CW complex Zn containing Xn as a deformation retract and also containing as a deformation retract a subcomplex Yn that is a simplicial complex. Beginning with Y0 … Z0 … X0 , suppose inductively that we have already constructed Yn and Zn . Let the cells en‡1 \u000b of X be attached by maps '\u000b : S n!Xn . Using the simplicial approximation theorem, there is a homotopy from '\u000b to a simplicial map f\u000b : S n!Yn . The CW complex Wn … Zn S \u000b M—f\u000b– contains a 184 Chapter 2 Homology simplicial subcomplex S n \u000b homeomorphic to S n at one end of M—f\u000b– , and the homeo- morphism S n ˇ S n \u000b is homotopic in Wn to the map f\u000b , hence also to '\u000b . Let Zn‡1 be obtained from Zn by attaching Dn‡1 \u000b \u0002 I ’s via these homotopies between the '\u000b ’s and the inclusions S n \u000b >Wn . Thus Zn‡1 contains Xn‡1 at one end, and at the other end we have a simplicial complex Yn‡1 … Yn S\u000b C—f\u000b– , where C—f\u000b– is obtained from M—f\u000b– by attaching a cone on the subcomplex S n \u000b . Since Dn‡1 \u0002 I deformation retracts onto @Dn‡1 \u0002 I [ Dn‡1 \u0002f1g , we see that Zn‡1 deformation retracts onto Zn [ Yn‡1 , which in turn deformation retracts onto Yn [ Yn‡1 … Yn‡1 by induction. Likewise, Zn‡1 deformation retracts onto Xn‡1 [ Wn which deformation retracts onto Xn‡1 [ Zn and hence onto Xn‡1 [ Xn … Xn‡1 by induction. Let Y … Sn Yn and Z … S n Zn . The deformation retractions of Zn onto Xn give deformation retractions of X [ Zn onto X , and the inﬁnite concatenation of the latter deformation retractions is a deformation retraction of Z onto X . Similarly, Z deformation retracts onto Y . tu Exercises 1. What is the minimum number of edges in simplicial complex structures K and L on S 1 such that there is a simplicial map K!L of degree n ? 2.

Verify that the formula f—z1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;z2k– … —z2; −z1; z4; −z3; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; z2k; −z2k−1– deﬁnes a map f : C2k!C 2k inducing a quotient map CP2k−1!CP2k−1 without ﬁxed points. 4.If X is a ﬁnite simplicial complex and f : X!X is a simplicial homeomorphism, show that the Lefschetz number ˝—f – equals the Euler characteristic of the set of ﬁxed points of f . In particular, ˝—f – is the number of ﬁxed points if the ﬁxed points are isolated. [Hint: Barycentrically subdivide X to make the ﬁxed point set a subcomplex.] 5. Let M be a closed orientable surface embedded in R 3 in such a way that reﬂection across a plane P deﬁnes a homeomorphism r : M!M ﬁxing M \\ P , a collection of circles.

Do an even-genus analog of Example 2C.4 by replacing the central torus by a sphere letting f be a homeomorphism that restricts to the antipodal map on this sphere. 7. Verify that the Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem holds also when ˝—f – is deﬁned using homology with coefﬁcients in a ﬁeld F . 8. Let X be homotopy equivalent to a ﬁnite simplicial complex and let Y be homotopy equivalent to a ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite simplicial complex. Using the simplicial ap- proximation theorem, show that there are at most countably many homotopy classes of maps X!Y . 9. Show that there are only countably many homotopy types of ﬁnite CW complexes. Cohomology is an algebraic variant of homology, the result of a simple dualiza- tion in the deﬁnition. Not surprisingly, the cohomology groups Hi—X– satisfy axioms much like the axioms for homology, except that induced homomorphisms go in the opposite direction as a result of the dualization. The basic distinction between homol- ogy and cohomology is thus that cohomology groups are contravariant functors while homology groups are covariant. In terms of intrinsic information, however, there is not a big difference between homology groups and cohomology groups. The homol- ogy groups of a space determine its cohomology groups, and the converse holds at least when the homology groups are ﬁnitely generated. What is a little surprising is that contravariance leads to extra structure in co- homology. This ﬁrst appears in a natural product, called cup product, which makes the cohomology groups of a space into a ring. This is an extremely useful piece of additional structure, and much of this chapter is devoted to studying cup products, which are considerably more subtle than the additive structure of cohomology. How does contravariance lead to a product in cohomology that is not present in homology? Actually there is a natural product in homology, but it takes the somewhat different form of a map Hi—X–\u0002 Hj—Y – -! Hi‡j—X \u0002 Y– called the cross product. If both X and Y are CW complexes, this cross product in homology is induced from a map of cellular chains sending a pair —ei;ej– consisting of a cell of X and a cell of Y to the product cell ei \u0002 ej in X \u0002 Y . The details of the construction are described in x3.B. Taking X … Y , we thus have the ﬁrst half of a hypothetical product Hi—X–\u0002 Hj—X– -! Hi‡j—X \u0002 X– -! Hi‡j—X– The difﬁculty is in deﬁning the second map. The natural thing would be for this to be induced by a map X \u0002 X!X . The multiplication map in a topological group, or more generally an H–space, is such a map, and the resulting Pontryagin product can be quite useful when studying these spaces, as we show in x3.C. But for general X , the only 186 Chapter 3 Cohomology natural maps X \u0002 X!X are the projections onto one of the factors, and since these projections collapse the other factor to a point, the resulting product in homology is rather trivial. With cohomology, however, the situation is better. One still has a cross product Hi—X–\u0002 Hj—Y – -! Hi‡j—X \u0002 Y– constructed in much the same way as in homology, so one can again take X … Y and get the ﬁrst half of a product Hi—X–\u0002 Hj—X– -! Hi‡j—X \u0002 X– -! Hi‡j—X– But now by contravariance the second map would be induced by a map X!X \u0002 X , and there is an obvious candidate for this map, the diagonal map Ñ—x– … —x; x– . This turns out to work very nicely, giving a well-behaved product in cohomology, the cup product. Another sort of extra structure in cohomology whose existence is traceable to contravariance is provided by cohomology operations. These make the cohomology groups of a space into a module over a certain rather complicated ring. Cohomology operations lie at a depth somewhat greater than the cup product structure, so we defer their study to x4.L. The extra layer of algebra in cohomology arising from the dualization in its def- inition may seem at ﬁrst to be separating it further from topology, but there are many topological situations where cohomology arises quite naturally. One of these is Poincar´e duality, the topic of the third section of this chapter. Another is obstruction theory, covered in x4.3. Characteristic classes in vector bundle theory (see [Milnor & Stasheff 1974] or [VBKT]) provide a further instance. From the viewpoint of homotopy theory, cohomology is in some ways more basic than homology. As we shall see in x4.3, cohomology has a description in terms of homotopy classes of maps that is very similar to, and in a certain sense dual to, the deﬁnition of homotopy groups. There is an analog of this for homology, described in x4.F, but the construction is more complicated. The Idea of Cohomology Let us look at a few low-dimensional examples to get an idea of how one might be led naturally to consider cohomology groups, and to see what properties of a space they might be measuring. For the sake of simplicity we consider simplicial cohomology of Ñ complexes, rather than singular cohomology of more general spaces. Taking the simplest case ﬁrst, let X be a 1 dimensional Ñ complex, or in other words an oriented graph. For a ﬁxed abelian group G , the set of all functions from ver- tices of X to G also forms an abelian group, which we denote by Ñ 0—X; G– . Similarly the set of all functions assigning an element of G to each edge of X forms an abelian group Ñ1—X; G– . We will be interested in the homomorphism \u000e : Ñ 0—X; G–!Ñ1—X; G– sending ' 2 Ñ0—X; G– to the function \u000e' 2 Ñ 1—X; G– whose value on an oriented The Idea of Cohomology 187 edge ƒv0;v1⁄ is the difference '—v1– − '—v0– . For example, X might be the graph formed by a system of trails on a mountain, with vertices at the junctions between trails. The function ' could then assign to each junction its elevation above sea level, in which case \u000e' would measure the net change in elevation along the trail from one junction to the next. Or X might represent a simple electrical circuit with ' mea- suring voltages at the connection points, the vertices, and \u000e' measuring changes in voltage across the components of the circuit, represented by edges. Regarding the map \u000e : Ñ 0—X; G–!Ñ 1—X; G– as a chain complex with 0 ’s before and after these two terms, the homology groups of this chain complex are by deﬁnition the simplicial cohomology groups of X , namely H0—X; G– … Ker \u000e ˆ Ñ 0—X; G– and H1—X; G– … Ñ 1—X; G–= Im \u000e . For simplicity we are using here the same notation as will be used for singular cohomology later in the chapter, in anticipation of the theorem that the two theories coincide for Ñ complexes, as we show in x3.1. The group H0—X; G– is easy to describe explicitly. A function ' 2 Ñ 0—X; G– has \u000e' … 0 iff ' takes the same value at both ends of each edge of X . This is equivalent to saying that ' is constant on each component of X .So H0—X; G– is the group of all functions from the set of components of X to G . This is a direct product of copies of G , one for each component of X . The cohomology group H1—X; G– … Ñ 1—X; G–= Im \u000e will be trivial iff the equation \u000e' … has a solution ' 2 Ñ 0—X; G– for each 2 Ñ 1—X; G– . Solving this equation means deciding whether specifying the change in ' across each edge of X determines an actual function ' 2 Ñ0—X; G– . This is rather like the calculus problem of ﬁnding a function having a speciﬁed derivative, with the difference operator \u000e playing the role of differentiation. As in calculus, if a solution of \u000e' … exists, it will be unique up to adding an element of the kernel of \u000e , that is, a function that is constant on each component of X . The equation \u000e' … is always solvable if X is a tree since if we choose arbitrarily a value for ' at a basepoint vertex v0 , then if the change in ' across each edge of X is speciﬁed, this uniquely determines the value of ' at every other vertex v by induction along the unique path from v0 to v in the tree. When X is not a tree, we ﬁrst choose a maximal tree in each component of X . Then, since every vertex lies in one of these maximal trees, the values of on the edges of the maximal trees determine ' uniquely up to a constant on each component of X . But in order for the equation \u000e' … to hold, the value of on each edge not in any of the maximal trees must equal the difference in the already-determined values of ' at the two ends of the edge. This condition need not be satisﬁed since can have arbitrary values on these edges. Thus we see that the cohomology group H1—X; G– is a direct product of copies of the group G , one copy for each edge of X not in one of the chosen maximal trees. This can be compared with the homology group H1—X; G– which consists of a direct sum of copies of G , one for each edge of X not in one of the maximal trees. 188 Chapter 3 Cohomology Note that the relation between H1—X; G– and H1—X; G– is the same as the relation between H0—X; G– and H0—X; G– , with H0—X; G– being a direct product of copies of G and H0—X; G– a direct sum, with one copy for each component of X in either case. Now let us move up a dimension, taking X to be a 2 dimensional Ñ complex. Deﬁne Ñ0—X; G– and Ñ 1—X; G– as before, as functions from vertices and edges of X to the abelian group G , and deﬁne Ñ 2—X; G– to be the functions from 2 simplices of X to G . A homomorphism \u000e : Ñ1—X; G–!Ñ 2—X; G– is deﬁned by \u000e —ƒv0;v1;v2⁄– … —ƒv0;v1⁄– ‡ —ƒv1;v2⁄– − —ƒv0;v2⁄– , a signed sum of the values of on the three edges in the boundary of ƒv0;v1;v2⁄ , just as \u000e'—ƒv0;v1⁄– for ' 2 Ñ0—X; G– was a signed sum of the values of ' on the boundary of ƒv0;v1⁄ . The two homomorphisms Ñ0—X; G– \u000e-----! Ñ1—X; G– \u000e-----! Ñ2—X; G– form a chain complex since for ' 2 Ñ 0—X; G– we have \u000e\u000e' … ( '—v1–−'—v0–\u0001‡( '—v2–−'—v1–\u0001−( '—v2–−'—v0–\u0001 … 0 . Extending this chain complex by 0 ’s on each end, the resulting homology groups are by deﬁnition the cohomology groups Hi—X; G– . The formula for the map \u000e : Ñ 1—X; G–!Ñ 2—X; G– can be looked at from several different viewpoints. Perhaps the simplest is the observation that \u000e … 0 iff satisﬁes the additivity property —ƒv0;v2⁄– … —ƒv0;v1⁄– ‡ —ƒv1;v2⁄– , where we think of the edge ƒv0;v2⁄ as the sum of the edges ƒv0;v1⁄ and ƒv1;v2⁄ . Thus \u000e measures the deviation of from being additive. From another point of view, \u000e can be regarded as an obstruction to ﬁnding ' 2 Ñ0—X; G– with … \u000e' , for if … \u000e' then \u000e … 0 since \u000e\u000e' … 0 aswesaw above. We can think of \u000e as a local obstruction to solving … \u000e' since it depends only on the values of within individual 2 simplices of X . If this local obstruction vanishes, then deﬁnes an element of H1—X; G– which is zero iff … \u000e' has an actual solution. This class in H1—X; G– is thus the global obstruction to solving … \u000e' . This situation is similar to the calculus problem of determining whether a given vector ﬁeld is the gradient vector ﬁeld of some function. The local obstruction here is the vanishing of the curl of the vector ﬁeld, and the global obstruction is the vanishing of all line integrals around closed loops in the domain of the vector ﬁeld. The condition \u000e … 0 has an interpretation of a more geometric nature when X is a surface and the group G is Z or Z2 . Consider ﬁrst the simpler case G … Z2 . The condition \u000e … 0 means that the number of times that takes the value 1 on the edges of each 2 simplex is even, either 0 or 2 . This means we can associate to a collection C of disjoint curves in X crossing the 1 skeleton transversely, such that the number of intersections of C with each edge is equal to the value of on that edge. If … \u000e' for some ' , then the curves of C divide X into two regions X0 and X1 where the subscript indicates the value of ' on all vertices in the region. The Idea of Cohomology 189 When G … Z we can reﬁne this construction by building C from a number of arcs in each 2 simplex, each arc having a transverse orientation, the orientation which agrees or disagrees with the orientation of each edge according to the sign of the value of on the edge, as in the ﬁgure at the right. The resulting collection C of disjoint curves in X can be thought of as something like level curves for a function ' with \u000e' … , if such a func- tion exists. The value of ' changes by 1 each time a curve of C is crossed. For example, if X is a disk then we will v 5 2 3 0 v 1 v 2 v 1 3 -2 0 v 1 v 2 4 4 3 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 00 show that H1—X; Z– … 0, so \u000e … 0 im- plies … \u000e' for some ' , hence every transverse curve system C forms the level curves of a function ' . On the other hand, if X is an annulus then this need no longer be true, as illustrated in the example shown in the ﬁgure at the left, where the equation … \u000e' obviously has no solution even though \u000e … 0 . By identifying the inner and outer boundary circles of this annulus we obtain a similar example on the torus. Even with G … Z2 the equation − \u000e' has no solution since the curve C does not separate X into two regions X0 and X1 . 1 1 ? ? 0 0 The key to relating cohomology groups to homology groups is the observation that a function from i simplices of X to G is equivalent to a homomorphism from the simplicial chain group Ñi—X– to G . This is because Ñi—X– is free abelian with basis the i simplices of X , and a homomorphism with domain a free abelian group is uniquely determined by its values on basis elements, which can be assigned arbitrarily. Thus we have an identiﬁcation of Ñ i—X; G– with the group Hom—Ñi—X–; G– of homomorphisms Ñi—X–!G , which is called the dual group of Ñi—X– . There is also a simple relationship of duality between the homomorphism \u000e : Ñ i—X; G–!Ñi‡1—X; G– and the boundary homomorphism @ : Ñi‡1—X–!Ñi—X– . The general formula for \u000e is \u000e'—ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi‡1⁄– … X j —−1– j'—ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvj; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi‡1⁄– and the latter sum is just '—@ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi‡1⁄– . Thus we have \u000e' … '@ . In other words, \u000e sends each ' 2 Hom—Ñi—X–; G– to the composition Ñi‡1—X– @-----! Ñi—X– ' -----! G , which in the language of linear algebra means that \u000e is the dual map of @ . Thus we have the algebraic problem of understanding the relationship between the homology groups of a chain complex and the homology groups of the dual complex obtained by applying the functor C,Hom—C; G– . This is the ﬁrst topic of the chapter. 190 Chapter 3 Cohomology Homology groups Hn—X– are the result of a two-stage process: First one forms a chain complex \u0001\u0001\u0001 -----! Cn @-----! Cn−1 -----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 of singular, simplicial, or cellular chains, then one takes the homology groups of this chain complex, Ker @= Im @ . To obtain the cohomology groups Hn—X; G– we interpolate an intermediate step, replacing the chain groups Cn by the dual groups Hom—Cn;G– and the boundary maps @ by their dual maps \u000e , before forming the cohomology groups Ker \u000e= Im \u000e . The plan for this section is ﬁrst to sort out the algebra of this dualization process and show that the cohomology groups are determined algebraically by the homology groups, though in a somewhat subtle way. Then after this algebraic excursion we will deﬁne the cohomology groups of spaces and show that these satisfy basic properties very much like those for homology. The payoff for all this formal work will begin to be apparent in subsequent sections. The Universal Coefﬁcient Theorem Let us begin with a simple example. Consider the chain complex ¡¡¡¡¡! 0 ZZ ¡¡¡¡¡! 2 Z ¡¡¡¡¡! 0 Z ¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! 00= C3= C2= C1= C0 where Z 2-----! Z is the map x , 2x . If we dualize by taking Hom—−;G– with G … Z , we obtain the cochain complex 0 ZZ 2 Z 0 Z ¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! 00= C3= C2= C1= C0 ¤ ¤¤¤ In the original chain complex the homology groups are Z ’s in dimensions 0 and 3 , together with a Z2 in dimension 1 . The homology groups of the dual cochain com- plex, which are called cohomology groups to emphasize the dualization, are again Z ’s in dimensions 0 and 3 , but the Z2 in the 1 dimensional homology of the original complex has shifted up a dimension to become a Z2 in 2 dimensional cohomology. More generally, consider any chain complex of ﬁnitely generated free abelian groups. Such a chain complex always splits as the direct sum of elementary com- plexes of the forms 0!Z!0 and 0!Z m-----! Z!0 , according to Exercise 43 in x2.2. Applying Hom—−; Z– to this direct sum of elementary complexes, we obtain the direct sum of the corresponding dual complexes 0 Z 0 and 0 Z m ------ Z 0 . Thus the cohomology groups are the same as the homology groups except that torsion is shifted up one dimension. We will see later in this section that the same relation between ho- mology and cohomology holds whenever the homology groups are ﬁnitely generated, even when the chain groups are not ﬁnitely generated. It would also be quite easy to Cohomology Groups Section 3.1 191 see in this example what happens if Hom—−; Z– is replaced by Hom—−;G– , since the dual elementary cochain complexes would then be 0 G 0 and 0 G m ------ G 0. Consider now a completely general chain complex C of free abelian groups \u0001\u0001\u0001 -----! Cn‡1 @------------! Cn @------------! Cn−1 -----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 To dualize this complex we replace each chain group Cn by its dual cochain group C \u0003 n … Hom—Cn;G– , the group of homomorphisms Cn!G , and we replace each bound- ary map @ : Cn!Cn−1 by its dual coboundary map \u000e … @\u0003 : C \u0003 n−1!C \u0003 n . The reason why \u000e goes in the opposite direction from @ , increasing rather than decreasing di- mension, is purely formal: For a homomorphism \u000b : A!B , the dual homomorphism \u000b\u0003 : Hom—B; G–!Hom—A; G– is deﬁned by \u000b \u0003—'– … '\u000b ,so \u000b \u0003 sends B ' -----! G to the composition A \u000b-----! B ' -----! G . Dual homomorphisms obviously satisfy —\u000b\f– \u0003 … \f \u0003\u000b \u0003 , 11\u0003 … 11 , and 0\u0003 … 0 . In particular, since @@ … 0 it follows that \u000e\u000e … 0 , and the cohomology group Hn—C; G– can be deﬁned as the ‘homology group’ Ker \u000e= Im \u000e at C \u0003 n in the cochain complex \u0001\u0001\u0001 --------- C \u0003 n‡1 \u000e ---------------- C \u0003 n \u000e ---------------- C \u0003 n−1 --------- \u0001\u0001\u0001 Our goal is to show that the cohomology groups Hn—C; G– are determined solely by G and the homology groups Hn—C– … Ker @= Im @ . A ﬁrst guess might be that Hn—C; G– is isomorphic to Hom—Hn—C–; G– , but this is overly optimistic, as shown by the example above where H2 was zero while H2 was nonzero. Nevertheless, there is a natural map h : Hn—C; G–!Hom—Hn—C–; G– , deﬁned as follows. Denote the cycles and boundaries by Zn … Ker @ ˆ Cn and Bn … Im @ ˆ Cn . A class in Hn—C; G– is represented by a homomorphism ' : Cn!G such that \u000e' … 0 , that is, '@ … 0 , or in other words, ' vanishes on Bn . The restriction '0 … ' jj Zn then induces a quotient homomorphism '0 : Zn=Bn!G , an element of Hom—Hn—C–; G– .If ' is in Im \u000e , say ' … \u000e … @ , then ' is zero on Zn ,so '0 … 0 and hence also '0 … 0 . Thus there is a well-deﬁned quotient map h : Hn—C; G–!Hom—Hn—C–; G– sending the cohomology class of ' to '0 . Obviously h is a homomorphism. It is not hard to see that h is surjective. The short exact sequence 0 -! Zn -! Cn @-----! Bn−1 -! 0 splits since Bn−1 is free, being a subgroup of the free abelian group Cn−1 . Thus there is a projection homomorphism p : Cn!Zn that restricts to the identity on Zn . Composing with p gives a way of extending homomorphisms '0 : Zn!G to homo- morphisms ' … '0p : Cn!G . In particular, this extends homomorphisms Zn!G that vanish on Bn to homomorphisms Cn!G that still vanish on Bn , or in other words, it extends homomorphisms Hn—C–!G to elements of Ker \u000e . Thus we have a homomorphism Hom—Hn—C–; G–! Ker \u000e . Composing this with the quotient map Ker \u000e!Hn—C; G– gives a homomorphism from Hom—Hn—C–; G– to Hn—C; G– .If we 192 Chapter 3 Cohomology follow this map by h we get the identity map on Hom—Hn—C–; G– since the effect of composing with h is simply to undo the effect of extending homomorphisms via p . This shows that h is surjective. In fact it shows that we have a split short exact sequence 0 -! Ker h -! Hn—C; G– h-----! Hom—Hn—C–; G– -! 0 The remaining task is to analyze Ker h . A convenient way to start the process is to consider not just the chain complex C , but also its subcomplexes consisting of the cycles and the boundaries. Thus we consider the commutative diagram of short exact sequences (i) Cn 1+ ¡¡¡¡¡!Zn 1+ ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! B 00 n ¡¡¡¡¡! @ @ Cn ¡¡¡¡¡!Zn ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! B 00 00 ¡¡¡¡¡! @¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! -n 1 where the vertical boundary maps on Zn‡1 and Bn are the restrictions of the boundary map in the complex C , hence are zero. Dualizing (i) gives a commutative diagram (ii) Cn 1+¡¡¡¡¡!Zn 1+¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!B 00 n¡¡¡¡¡! Cn¡¡¡¡¡!Zn¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!B 00 00¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡! ¡¡! ¡¡! -n 1 ¤¤ ¤ ¤¤¤ ± The rows here are exact since, as we have already remarked, the rows of (i) split, and the dual of a split short exact sequence is a split short exact sequence because of the natural isomorphism Hom—A \b B; G– ˇ Hom—A; G– \b Hom—B; G– . We may view (ii), like (i), as part of a short exact sequence of chain complexes. Since the coboundary maps in the Z \u0003 n and B\u0003 n complexes are zero, the associated long exact sequence of homology groups has the form —iii– \u0001\u0001\u0001 ------ B\u0003 n ------ Z \u0003 n ------ Hn—C; G– ------ B\u0003 n−1 ------ Z \u0003 n−1 ------ \u0001\u0001\u0001 The ‘boundary maps’ Z \u0003 n!B\u0003 n in this long exact sequence are in fact the dual maps i\u0003 n of the inclusions in : Bn!Zn , as one sees by recalling how these boundary maps are deﬁned: In (ii) one takes an element of Z \u0003 n , pulls this back to C \u0003 n , applies \u000e to get an element of C \u0003 n‡1 , then pulls this back to B\u0003 n . The ﬁrst of these steps extends a homomorphism '0 : Zn!G to ' : Cn!G , the second step composes this ' with @ , and the third step undoes this composition and restricts ' to Bn . The net effect is just to restrict '0 from Zn to Bn . A long exact sequence can always be broken up into short exact sequences, and doing this for the sequence (iii) yields short exact sequences —iv– 0 ------ Ker i \u0003 n ------ Hn—C; G– ------ Coker i \u0003 n−1 ------ 0 The group Ker i\u0003 n can be identiﬁed naturally with Hom—Hn—C–; G– since elements of Ker i\u0003 n are homomorphisms Zn!G that vanish on the subgroup Bn , and such homo- morphisms are the same as homomorphisms Zn=Bn!G . Under this identiﬁcation of Cohomology Groups Section 3.1 193 Ker i \u0003 n with Hom—Hn—C–; G– , the map Hn—C; G–! Ker i \u0003 n in (iv) becomes the map h considered earlier. Thus we can rewrite (iv) as a split short exact sequence —v– 0 -! Coker i \u0003 n−1 -! Hn—C; G– h-----! Hom—Hn—C–; G– -! 0 Our objective now is to show that the more mysterious term Coker i \u0003 n−1 de- pends only on Hn−1—C– and G , in a natural, functorial way. First let us observe that Coker i\u0003 n−1 would be zero if it were always true that the dual of a short exact sequence was exact, since the dual of the short exact sequence —vi– 0 -----! Bn−1 in−1-----------------! Zn−1 -----! Hn−1—C– -----! 0 is the sequence —vii– 0 ------ B\u0003 n−1 i\u0003 n−1 ------------------- Z \u0003 n−1 ------ Hn−1—C– \u0003 ------ 0 and if this were exact at B\u0003 n−1 , then i \u0003 n−1 would be surjective, hence Coker i \u0003 n−1 would be zero. This argument does apply if Hn−1—C– happens to be free, since (vi) splits in this case, which implies that (vii) is also split exact. So in this case the map h in (v) is an isomorphism. However, in the general case it is easy to ﬁnd short exact sequences whose duals are not exact. For example, if we dualize 0!Z n-----! Z!Zn!0 by applying Hom—−; Z– we get 0 Z n ------ Z 0 0 which fails to be exact at the left-hand Z , precisely the place we are interested in for Coker i \u0003 n−1 . We might mention in passing that the loss of exactness at the left end of a short exact sequence after dualization is in fact all that goes wrong, in view of the following: Exercise.If A!B!C!0 is exact, then dualizing by applying Hom—−;G– yields an exact sequence A\u0003 B\u0003 C \u0003 0. However, we will not need this fact in what follows. The exact sequence (vi) has the special feature that both Bn−1 and Zn−1 are free, so (vi) can be regarded as a free resolution of Hn−1—C– , where a free resolution of an abelian group H is an exact sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 -----! F2 f2------------! F1 f1------------! F0 f0------------! H -----! 0 with each Fn free. If we dualize this free resolution by applying Hom—−;G– ,we may lose exactness, but at least we get a chain complex — or perhaps we should say ‘cochain complex,’ but algebraically there is no difference. This dual complex has the form \u0001\u0001\u0001 ------ F \u0003 2 f \u0003 2 ------------- F \u0003 1 f \u0003 1 ------------- F \u0003 0 f \u0003 0 ------------- H\u0003 ------ 0 Let us use the temporary notation Hn—F ; G– for the homology group Ker f \u0003 n‡1= Im f \u0003 n of this dual complex. Note that the group Coker i \u0003 n−1 that we are interested in is H1—F ; G– where F is the free resolution in (vi). Part (b) of the following lemma there- fore shows that Coker i \u0003 n−1 depends only on Hn−1—C– and G . 194 Chapter 3 Cohomology Lemma 3.1. (a) Given free resolutions F and F 0 of abelian groups H and H0 , then every homomorphism \u000b : H!H0 can be extended to a chain map from F to F 0 : ¡¡¡¡!F f 1 1¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡! F f 2 2 ¡¡¡¡!F ¡¡¡!H 0 f 0 0 0 ... ¡¡¡¡!F f 1 1¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡! F f 2 2 ¡¡¡¡!F ¡¡¡!H 0 f 0 0... 0 00 0 00 0¡¡¡!®¡¡¡!®1¡¡¡!®2¡¡¡!® Furthermore, any two such chain maps extending \u000b are chain homotopic. (b) For any two free resolutions F and F 0 of H , there are canonical isomorphisms Hn—F ; G– ˇ Hn—F 0; G– for all n . Proof: The \u000bi ’s will be constructed inductively. Since the Fi ’s are free, it sufﬁces to deﬁne each \u000bi on a basis for Fi . To deﬁne \u000b0 , observe that surjectivity of f 0 0 implies that for each basis element x of F0 there exists x0 2 F 0 0 such that f 0 0—x0– … \u000bf0—x– , so we deﬁne \u000b0—x– … x0 . We would like to deﬁne \u000b1 in the same way, sending a basis element x 2 F1 to an element x0 2 F 0 1 such that f 0 1—x0– … \u000b0f1—x– . Such an x0 will exist if \u000b0f1—x– lies in Im f 0 1 … Ker f 0 0 , which it does since f 0 0\u000b0f1 … \u000bf0f1 … 0 . The same procedure deﬁnes all the subsequent \u000bi ’s. If we have another chain map extending \u000b given by maps \u000b 0 i : Fi!F 0 i , then the differences \fi … \u000bi − \u000b 0 i deﬁne a chain map extending the zero map \f : H!H0 .It will sufﬁce to construct maps \u0015i : Fi!F 0 i‡1 deﬁning a chain homotopy from \fi to 0 , that is, with \fi … f 0 i‡1\u0015i ‡ \u0015i−1fi . The \u0015i ’s are constructed inductively by a procedure much like the construction of the \u000bi ’s. When i … 0 we let \u0015−1 : H!F 0 0 be zero, and then the desired relation becomes \f0 … f 0 1\u00150 . We can achieve this by letting \u00150 send a basis element x to an element x0 2 F 0 1 such that f 0 1—x0– … \f0—x– . Such an x0 exists since Im f 0 1 … Ker f 0 0 and f 0 0\f0—x– … \ff0—x– … 0 . For the inductive step we wish to deﬁne \u0015i to take a basis element x 2 Fi to an element x0 2 F 0 i‡1 such that f 0 i‡1—x0– … \fi—x– − \u0015i−1fi—x– . This will be possible if \fi—x– − \u0015i−1fi—x– lies in Im f 0 i‡1 … Ker f 0 i , which will hold if f 0 i —\fi − \u0015i−1fi– … 0 . Using the relation f 0 i \fi … \fi−1fi and the relation \fi−1 … f 0 i \u0015i−1 ‡ \u0015i−2fi−1 which holds by induction, we have f 0 i —\fi − \u0015i−1fi– … f 0 i \fi − f 0 i \u0015i−1fi … \fi−1fi − f 0 i \u0015i−1fi … —\fi−1 − f 0 i \u0015i−1–fi … \u0015i−2fi−1fi … 0 as desired. This ﬁnishes the proof of (a). The maps \u000bn constructed in (a) dualize to maps \u000b \u0003 n : F 0\u0003 n !F \u0003 n forming a chain map between the dual complexes F 0\u0003 and F \u0003 . Therefore we have induced homomor- phisms on cohomology \u000b\u0003 : Hn—F 0; G–!Hn—F ; G– . These do not depend on the choice of \u000bn ’s since any other choices \u000b 0 n are chain homotopic, say via chain homotopies \u0015n , and then \u000b \u0003 n and \u000b0\u0003 n are chain homotopic via the dual maps \u0015 \u0003 n since the dual of the relation \u000bi − \u000b0 i … f 0 i‡1\u0015i ‡ \u0015i−1fi is \u000b\u0003 i − \u000b0\u0003 i … \u0015 \u0003 i f 0\u0003 i‡1 ‡ f \u0003 i \u0015 \u0003 i−1 . The induced homomorphisms \u000b\u0003 : Hn—F 0; G–!Hn—F ; G– satisfy —\f\u000b– \u0003 … \u000b\u0003\f \u0003 for a composition H \u000b-----! H0 \f -----! H00 with a free resolution F 00 of H00 also given, since Cohomology Groups Section 3.1 195 one can choose the compositions \fn\u000bn of extensions \u000bn of \u000b and \fn of \f as an extension of \f\u000b . In particular, if we take \u000b to be an isomorphism and \f to be its inverse, with F 00 … F , then \u000b\u0003\f \u0003 … —\f\u000b– \u0003 … 11 , the latter equality coming from the obvious extension of 11: H!H by the identity map of F . The same reasoning shows \f\u0003\u000b \u0003 … 11, so \u000b \u0003 is an isomorphism. Finally, if we specialize further, taking \u000b to be the identity but with two different free resolutions F and F 0 , we get a canonical isomorphism 11 \u0003 : Hn—F 0; G–!Hn—F ; G– . tu Every abelian group H has a free resolution of the form 0!F1!F0!H!0 , with Fi … 0 for i> 1 , obtainable in the following way. Choose a set of generators for H and let F0 be a free abelian group with basis in one-to-one correspondence with these generators. Then we have a surjective homomorphism f0 : F0!H sending the basis elements to the chosen generators. The kernel of f0 is free, being a subgroup of a free abelian group, so we can let F1 be this kernel with f1 : F1!F0 the inclusion, and we can then take Fi … 0 for i> 1 . For this free resolution we obviously have Hn—F ; G– … 0 for n> 1 , so this must also be true for all free resolutions. Thus the only interesting group Hn—F ; G– is H1—F ; G– . As we have seen, this group depends only on H and G , and the standard notation for it is Ext—H; G– . This notation arises from the fact that Ext—H; G– has an interpretation as the set of isomorphism classes of extensions of G by H , that is, short exact sequences 0!G!J!H!0 , with a natural deﬁnition of isomorphism between such exact sequences. This is explained in books on homological algebra, for example [Brown 1982], [Hilton & Stammbach 1970], or [MacLane 1963]. However, this interpretation of Ext—H; G– is rarely needed in algebraic topology. Summarizing, we have established the following algebraic result: Theorem 3.2. If a chain complex C of free abelian groups has homology groups Hn—C– , then the cohomology groups Hn—C; G– of the cochain complex Hom—Cn;G– are determined by split exact sequences 0 -! Ext—Hn−1—C–; G– -! Hn—C; G– h-----! Hom—Hn—C–; G– -! 0 tu This is known as the universal coefﬁcient theorem for cohomology because it is formally analogous to the universal coefﬁcient theorem for homology in x3.A which expresses homology with arbitrary coefﬁcients in terms of homology with Z coefﬁcients. Computing Ext—H; G– for ﬁnitely generated H is not difﬁcult using the following three properties: Ext—H \b H0;G– ˇ Ext—H; G–\b Ext—H0;G– . Ext—H; G– … 0if H is free. Ext—Zn;G– ˇ G=nG . The ﬁrst of these can be obtained by using the direct sum of free resolutions of H and H0 as a free resolution for H \b H0 .If H is free, the free resolution 0!H!H!0 196 Chapter 3 Cohomology yields the second property, while the third comes from dualizing the free resolution 0 -! Z n-----! Z -! Zn -! 0 to produce an exact sequence Z ¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡! 00======()n n n n,Ext G Z ¡¡¡¡¡! (),Hom G Z ¡¡¡¡! (),Hom G Z(),Hom G G/nG G ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! G In particular, these three properties imply that Ext—H; Z– is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup of H if H is ﬁnitely generated. Since Hom—H; Z– is isomorphic to the free part of H if H is ﬁnitely generated, we have: Corollary 3.3. If the homology groups Hn and Hn−1 of a chain complex C of free abelian groups are ﬁnitely generated, with torsion subgroups Tn ˆ Hn and Tn−1 ˆ Hn−1 , then Hn—C; Z– ˇ —Hn=Tn–\b Tn−1 . tu It is useful in many situations to know that the short exact sequences in the universal coefﬁcient theorem are natural, meaning that a chain map \u000b between chain complexes C and C 0 of free abelian groups induces a commutative diagram ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡! 00 ( h ,Ext - CHn 1() G ) ¡¡¡¡!( ,Hom CHn() G );CH n( G ) ¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! 00 ( h ,Ext - CHn 1() G )) ¡¡¡¡!( ,Hom CHn() G );CH n( ( G ) 00 0 ¤® ¤ ¤®( )¤ ¤® This is apparent if one just thinks about the construction; one obviously obtains a map between the short exact sequences (iv) containing Ker i \u0003 n and Coker i\u0003 n−1 , the identi- ﬁcation Ker i\u0003 n … Hom—Hn—C–; G– is certainly natural, and the proof of Lemma 3.1 shows that Ext—H; G– depends naturally on H . However, the splitting in the universal coefﬁcient theorem is not natural since it depends on the choice of the projections p : Cn!Zn . An exercise at the end of the section gives a topological example showing that the splitting in fact cannot be natural. The naturality property together with the ﬁve-lemma proves: Corollary 3.4. If a chain map between chain complexes of free abelian groups in- duces an isomorphism on homology groups, then it induces an isomorphism on co- homology groups with any coefﬁcient group G . tu One could attempt to generalize the algebraic machinery of the universal coefﬁ- cient theorem by replacing abelian groups by modules over a chosen ring R and Hom by HomR , the R module homomorphisms. The key fact about abelian groups that was needed was that subgroups of free abelian groups are free. Submodules of free R modules are free if R is a principal ideal domain, so in this case the generalization is automatic. One obtains natural split short exact sequences 0 -! ExtR—Hn−1—C–; G– -! Hn—C; G– h-----! HomR—Hn—C–; G– -! 0 Cohomology Groups Section 3.1 197 where C is a chain complex of free R modules with boundary maps R module ho- momorphisms, and the coefﬁcient group G is also an R module. If R is a ﬁeld, for example, then R modules are always free and so the ExtR term is always zero since we may choose free resolutions of the form 0!F0!H!0. It is interesting to note that the proof of Lemma 3.1 on the uniqueness of free res- olutions is valid for modules over an arbitrary ring R . Moreover, every R module H has a free resolution, which can be constructed in the following way. Choose a set of generators for H as an R module, and let F0 be a free R module with basis in one-to- one correspondence with these generators. Thus we have a surjective homomorphism f0 : F0!H sending the basis elements to the chosen generators. Now repeat the pro- cess with Ker f0 in place of H , constructing a homomorphism f1 : F1!F0 sending a basis for a free R module F1 onto generators for Ker f0 . And inductively, construct fn : Fn!Fn−1 with image equal to Ker fn−1 by the same procedure. By Lemma 3.1 the groups Hn—F ; G– depend only on H and G , not on the free resolution F . The standard notation for Hn—F ; G– is Extn R—H; G– . For sufﬁciently complicated rings R the groups Extn R—H; G– can be nonzero for n> 1 . In certain more advanced topics in algebraic topology these Extn R groups play an essential role. A ﬁnal remark about the deﬁnition of Extn R—H; G– : By the Exercise stated earlier, exactness of F1!F0!H!0 implies exactness of F \u0003 1 F \u0003 0 H\u0003 0 . This means that H0—F ; G– as deﬁned above is zero. Rather than having Ext 0 R—H; G– be automati- cally zero, it is better to deﬁne Hn—F ; G– as the n th homology group of the complex \u0001\u0001\u0001 F \u0003 1 F \u0003 0 0 with the term H\u0003 omitted. This can be viewed as deﬁning the groups Hn—F ; G– to be unreduced cohomology groups. With this slightly modiﬁed deﬁnition we have Ext0 R—H; G– … H0—F ; G– … H\u0003 … HomR—H; G– by the exactness of F \u0003 1 F \u0003 0 H\u0003 0 . The real reason why unreduced Ext groups are better than re- duced groups is perhaps to be found in certain exact sequences involving Ext and Hom derived in x3.F, which would not work with the Hom terms replaced by zeros. Cohomology of Spaces Now we return to topology. Given a space X and an abelian group G , we deﬁne the group C n—X; G– of singular n cochains with coefﬁcients in G to be the dual group Hom—Cn—X–; G– of the singular chain group Cn—X– . Thus an n cochain ' 2 C n—X; G– assigns to each singular n simplex ˙ : Ñ n!X a value '—˙ – 2 G . Since the singular n simplices form a basis for Cn—X– , these values can be chosen arbitrarily, hence n cochains are exactly equivalent to functions from singular n simplices to G . The coboundary map \u000e : C n—X; G–!C n‡1—X; G– is the dual @\u0003 , so for a cochain ' 2 C n—X; G– , its coboundary \u000e' is the composition Cn‡1—X– @-----! Cn—X– ' -----! G . This means that for a singular —n ‡ 1– simplex ˙ : Ñ n‡1!X we have \u000e'—˙ – … X i —−1– i'—˙ jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn‡1⁄– 198 Chapter 3 Cohomology It is automatic that \u000e 2 … 0 since \u000e 2 is the dual of @2 … 0 . Therefore we can deﬁne the cohomology group Hn—X; G– with coefﬁcients in G to be the quotient Ker \u000e= Im \u000e at C n—X; G– in the cochain complex \u0001\u0001\u0001 ------ C n‡1—X; G– \u000e ------------- C n—X; G– \u000e ------------- C n−1—X; G– ------ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ------ C 0—X; G– ------ 0 Elements of Ker \u000e are cocycles, and elements of Im \u000e are coboundaries. For a cochain ' to be a cocycle means that \u000e' … '@ … 0 , or in other words, ' vanishes on boundaries. Since the chain groups Cn—X– are free, the algebraic universal coefﬁcient theorem takes on the topological guise of split short exact sequences 0 -! Ext—Hn−1—X–; G– -! Hn—X; G– -! Hom—Hn—X–; G– -! 0 which describe how cohomology groups with arbitrary coefﬁcients are determined purely algebraically by homology groups with Z coefﬁcients. For example, if the ho- mology groups of X are ﬁnitely generated then Corollary 3.3 tells how to compute the cohomology groups Hn—X; Z– from the homology groups. When n … 0 there is no Ext term, and the universal coefﬁcient theorem reduces to an isomorphism H0—X; G– ˇ Hom—H0—X–; G– . This can also be seen directly from the deﬁnitions. Since singular 0 simplices are just points of X , a cochain in C 0—X; G– is an arbitrary function ' : X!G , not necessarily continuous. For this to be a cocycle means that for each singular 1 simplex ˙ : ƒv0;v1⁄!X we have \u000e'—˙ – … '—@˙ – … '( ˙—v1–\u0001 − '( ˙—v0–\u0001 … 0 . This is equivalent to saying that ' is constant on path- components of X . Thus H0—X; G– is all the functions from path-components of X to G . This is the same as Hom—H0—X–; G– . Likewise in the case of H1—X; G– the universal coefﬁcient theorem gives an iso- morphism H1—X; G– ˇ Hom—H1—X–; G– since Ext—H0—X–; G– … 0 , the group H0—X– being free. If X is path-connected, H1—X– is the abelianization of ˇ1—X– and we can identify Hom—H1—X–; G– with Hom—ˇ1—X–; G– since G is abelian. The universal coefﬁcient theorem has a simpler form if we take coefﬁcients in a ﬁeld F for both homology and cohomology. In x2.2 we deﬁned the homology groups Hn—X; F– as the homology groups of the chain complex of free F modules Cn—X; F– , where Cn—X; F– has basis the singular n simplices in X . The dual com- plex HomF —Cn—X; F–; F – of F module homomorphisms is the same as Hom—Cn—X–; F – since both can be identiﬁed with the functions from singular n simplices to F . Hence the homology groups of the dual complex HomF —Cn—X; F–; F – are the cohomology groups Hn—X; F– . In the generalization of the universal coefﬁcient theorem to the case of modules over a principal ideal domain, the ExtF terms vanish since F is a ﬁeld, so we obtain isomorphisms Hn—X; F– ˇ HomF —Hn—X; F–; F – Cohomology Groups Section 3.1 199 Thus, with ﬁeld coefﬁcients, cohomology is the exact dual of homology. Note that when F … Zp or Q we have HomF —H; G– … Hom—H; G– , the group homomorphisms, for arbitrary F modules G and H . For the remainder of this section we will go through the main features of singular homology and check that they extend without much difﬁculty to cohomology. Reduced Groups. Reduced cohomology groups eHn—X; G– can be deﬁned by dualizing the augmented chain complex \u0001\u0001\u0001 !C0—X– \"-----! Z!0 , then taking Ker = Im . As with homology, this gives eHn—X; G– … Hn—X; G– for n> 0 , and the universal coefﬁcient theorem identiﬁes eH0—X; G– with Hom— eH0—X–; G– . We can describe the difference be- tween eH0—X; G– and H0—X; G– more explicitly by using the interpretation of H0—X; G– as functions X!G that are constant on path-components. Recall that the augmen- tation map \" : C0—X–!Z sends each singular 0 simplex ˙ to 1 , so the dual map \"\u0003 sends a homomorphism ' : Z!G to the composition C0—X– \"-----! Z ' -----! G , which is the function ˙ , '—1– . This is a constant function X!G , and since '—1– can be any element of G , the image of \"\u0003 consists of precisely the constant functions. Thus eH0—X; G– is all functions X!G that are constant on path-components modulo the functions that are constant on all of X . Relative Groups and the Long Exact Sequence of a Pair. To deﬁne relative groups Hn—X; A; G– for a pair —X; A– we ﬁrst dualize the short exact sequence 0 -! Cn—A– i-----! Cn—X– j -----! Cn—X; A– -! 0 by applying Hom—−;G– to get 0 ------ C n—A; G– i\u0003 ------ C n—X; G– j\u0003 ------ C n—X; A; G– ------ 0 where by deﬁnition C n—X; A; G– … Hom—Cn—X; A–; G– . This sequence is exact by the following direct argument. The map i \u0003 restricts a cochain on X to a cochain on A . Thus for a function from singular n simplices in X to G , the image of this function under i\u0003 is obtained by restricting the domain of the function to singular n simplices in A . Every function from singular n simplices in A to G can be extended to be deﬁned on all singular n simplices in X , for example by assigning the value 0 to all singular n simplices not in A ,so i \u0003 is surjective. The kernel of i \u0003 consists of cochains taking the value 0 on singular n simplices in A . Such cochains are the same as homomorphisms Cn—X; A– … Cn—X–=Cn—A–!G , so the kernel of i\u0003 is exactly C n—X; A; G– … Hom—Cn—X; A–; G– , giving the desired exactness. Notice that we can view C n—X; A; G– as the functions from singular n simplices in X to G that vanish on simplices in A , since the basis for Cn—X– consisting of singular n simplices in X is the disjoint union of the simplices with image contained in A and the simplices with image not contained in A . Relative coboundary maps \u000e : C n—X; A; G–!C n‡1—X; A; G– are obtained as restric- tions of the absolute \u000e ’s, so relative cohomology groups Hn—X; A; G– are deﬁned. The 200 Chapter 3 Cohomology fact that the relative cochain group is a subgroup of the absolute cochains, namely the cochains vanishing on chains in A , means that relative cohomology is conceptually a little simpler than relative homology. The maps i\u0003 and j\u0003 commute with \u000e since i and j commute with @ , so the preceding displayed short exact sequence of cochain groups is part of a short exact sequence of cochain complexes, giving rise to an associated long exact sequence of cohomology groups \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Hn—X; A; G– j\u0003 -----! Hn—X; G– i\u0003 -----! Hn—A; G– \u000e-----! Hn‡1—X; A; G– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 By similar reasoning one obtains a long exact sequence of reduced cohomology groups for a pair —X; A– with A nonempty, where eHn—X; A; G– … Hn—X; A; G– for all n ,asin homology. Taking A to be a point x0 , this exact sequence gives an identiﬁcation of eHn—X; G– with Hn—X; x0; G– . More generally there is a long exact sequence for a triple —X;A;B– coming from the short exact sequences 0 ------ C n—A; B; G– i\u0003 ------ C n—X; B; G– j\u0003 ------ C n—X; A; G– ------ 0 The long exact sequence of reduced cohomology can be regarded as the special case that B is a point. As one would expect, there is a duality relationship between the connecting ho- momorphisms \u000e : Hn—A; G–!Hn‡1—X; A; G– and @ : Hn‡1—X; A–!Hn—A– . This takes the form of the commutative diagram shown at the right. To verify commu- AGH (); G ); n ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! XAH ( , n 1+ Hom ( Hom (AGH ()), G )),n ¡¡¡! XAH ( ,n 1+ ± ¤@¡¡¡¡¡!h¡¡¡¡¡!h tativity, recall how the two connecting homomorphisms are deﬁned, via the diagrams G ); XGC (); n AGC (); n XC ( n 1+ G );XAC ( , n 1+¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! G ); XGC ();AGC ();nn ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! XC (n 1+ n 1+ G );XAC ( ,¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! The connecting homomorphisms are represented by the dashed arrows, which are well-deﬁned only when the chain and cochain groups are replaced by homology and cohomology groups. To show that h\u000e … @\u0003h , start with an element \u000b 2 Hn—A; G– represented by a cocycle ' 2 C n—A; G– . To compute \u000e—\u000b– we ﬁrst extend ' to a cochain ' 2 C n—X; G– , say by letting it take the value 0 on singular simplices not in A . Then we compose ' with @ : Cn‡1—X–!Cn—X– to get a cochain '@ 2 C n‡1—X; G– , which actually lies in C n‡1—X; A; G– since the original ' was a cocycle in A . This cochain '@ 2 C n‡1—X; A; G– represents \u000e—\u000b– in Hn‡1—X; A; G– . Now we apply the map h , which simply restricts the domain of '@ to relative cycles in Cn‡1—X; A– , that is, —n ‡ 1– chains in X whose boundary lies in A . On such chains we have '@ … '@ since the extension of ' to ' is irrelevant. The net result of all this is that h\u000e—\u000b– Cohomology Groups Section 3.1 201 is represented by '@ . Let us compare this with @\u0003h—\u000b– . Applying h to ' restricts its domain to cycles in A . Then applying @\u0003 composes with the map which sends a relative —n ‡ 1– cycle in X to its boundary in A . Thus @\u0003h—\u000b– is represented by '@ just as h\u000e—\u000b– was, and so the square commutes. Induced Homomorphisms. Dual to the chain maps f] : Cn—X–!Cn—Y – induced by f : X!Y are the cochain maps f ] : C n—Y ; G–!C n—X; G– . The relation f]@ … @f] dualizes to \u000ef ] … f ]\u000e ,so f ] induces homomorphisms f \u0003 : Hn—Y ; G–!Hn—X; G– . In the relative case a map f : —X; A–!—Y ; B– induces f \u0003 : Hn—Y ; B; G–!Hn—X; A; G– by the same reasoning, and in fact f induces a map between short exact sequences of cochain complexes, hence a map between long exact sequences of cohomology groups, with commuting squares. The properties —f g–] … g]f ] and 11] … 11 imply —f g– \u0003 … g\u0003f \u0003 and 11 \u0003 … 11, so X , Hn—X; G– and —X; A– , Hn—X; A; G– are contravariant functors, the ‘contra’ indicating that induced maps go in the reverse direction. The algebraic universal coefﬁcient theorem applies also to relative cohomology since the relative chain groups Cn—X; A– are free, and there is a naturality statement: A map f : —X; A–!—Y ; B– induces a commutative diagram ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡! 00 ( h f f ,,Ext - XA ,XA ,XAHn 1() G ) ¡¡¡¡!( ,Hom Hn() G );H n( G ) ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! 00 ( h ,,Ext - YB ,YB ,YBHn 1() G )) ¡¡¡¡!( ,Hom Hn() G );H n( ( G ) ¤ ¤ ¤f( )¤ ¤ This follows from the naturality of the algebraic universal coefﬁcient sequences since the vertical maps are induced by the chain maps f] : Cn—X; A–!Cn—Y ; B– . When the subspaces A and B are empty we obtain the absolute forms of these results. Homotopy Invariance. The statement is that if f ' g : —X; A–!—Y ; B– , then f \u0003 … g\u0003 : Hn—Y ; B–!Hn—X; A– . This is proved by direct dualization of the proof for ho- mology. From the proof of Theorem 2.10 we have a chain homotopy P satisfying g] − f] … @P ‡ P@ . This relation dualizes to g] − f ] … P \u0003\u000e ‡ \u000eP \u0003 ,so P \u0003 is a chain homotopy between the maps f ];g] : C n—Y ; G–!C n—X; G– . This restricts also to a chain homotopy between f ] and g] on relative cochains, the cochains vanishing on singular simplices in the subspaces B and A . Since f ] and g] are chain homotopic, they induce the same homomorphism f \u0003 … g\u0003 on cohomology. Excision. For cohomology this says that for subspaces Z ˆ A ˆ X with the closure of Z contained in the interior of A , the inclusion i : —X − Z; A − Z– > —X; A– induces isomorphisms i\u0003 : Hn—X; A; G–!Hn—X − Z; A − Z; G– for all n . This follows from the corresponding result for homology by the naturality of the universal coefﬁcient theorem and the ﬁve-lemma. Alternatively, if one wishes to avoid appealing to the universal coefﬁcient theorem, the proof of excision for homology dualizes easily to cohomology by the following argument. In the proof for homology there were chain maps \u0013 : Cn—A ‡ B–!Cn—X– and ˆ : Cn—X–!Cn—A ‡ B– such that ˆ\u0013 … 11 and 11 − \u0013ˆ … @D ‡ D@ for a chain homotopy D . Dualizing by taking Hom—−;G– , we have maps 202 Chapter 3 Cohomology ˆ\u0003 and \u0013\u0003 between C n—A ‡ B; G– and C n—X; G– , and these induce isomorphisms on cohomology since \u0013\u0003ˆ\u0003 … 11 and 11 − ˆ\u0003\u0013\u0003 … D\u0003\u000e ‡ \u000eD\u0003 . By the ﬁve-lemma, the maps C n—X; A; G–!C n—A ‡ B; A; G– also induce isomorphisms on cohomology. There is an obvious identiﬁcation of C n—A‡B; A; G– with C n—B; A\\B; G– , so we get isomorphisms Hn—X; A; G–– ˇ Hn—B; A \\ B; G– induced by the inclusion —B; A \\ B– > —X; A– . Axioms for Cohomology. These are exactly dual to the axioms for homology. Restrict- ing attention to CW complexes again, a (reduced) cohomology theory is a sequence of contravariant functors ehn from CW complexes to abelian groups, together with nat- ural coboundary homomorphisms \u000e : eh n—A–! eh n‡1—X=A– for CW pairs —X; A– , satis- fying the following axioms: (1) If f ' g : X!Y , then f \u0003 … g\u0003 : eh n—Y –! eh n—X– . (2) For each CW pair —X; A– there is a long exact sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u000e------------! eh n—X=A– q\u0003 ------------! eh n—X– i\u0003 ------------! eh n—A– \u000e------------! eh n‡1—X=A– q\u0003 ------------! \u0001\u0001\u0001 where i is the inclusion and q is the quotient map. (3) For a wedge sum X … W \u000b X\u000b with inclusions i\u000b : X\u000b > X , the product map Q \u000b i \u0003 \u000b : eh n—X–!Q \u000b eh n—X\u000b– is an isomorphism for each n . We have already seen that the ﬁrst axiom holds for singular cohomology. The sec- ond axiom follows from excision in the same way as for homology, via isomorphisms eHn—X=A; G– ˇ Hn—X; A; G– . Note that the third axiom involves direct product, rather than the direct sum appearing in the homology version. This is because of the nat- ural isomorphism Hom—L \u000bA\u000b;G– ˇ Q \u000b Hom—A\u000b;G– , which implies that the cochain complex of a disjoint union ` \u000b X\u000b is the direct product of the cochain complexes of the individual X\u000b ’s, and this direct product splitting passes through to cohomol- ogy groups. The same argument applies in the relative case, so we get isomorphisms Hn—` \u000b X\u000b; ` \u000b A\u000b; G– ˇ Q \u000b Hn—X\u000b;A\u000b; G– . The third axiom is obtained by taking the A\u000b ’s to be basepoints x\u000b and passing to the quotient ` \u000b X\u000b= ` \u000b x\u000b … W \u000b X\u000b . The relation between reduced and unreduced cohomology theories is the same as for homology, as described in x2.3. Simplicial Cohomology.If X is a Ñ complex and A ˆ X is a subcomplex, then the simplicial chain groups Ñn—X; A– dualize to simplicial cochain groups Ñ n—X; A; G– … Hom—Ñn—X; A–; G– , and the resulting cohomology groups are by deﬁnition the sim- plicial cohomology groups Hn Ñ —X; A; G– . Since the inclusions Ñn—X; A– ˆ Cn—X; A– induce isomorphisms HÑ n—X; A– ˇ Hn—X; A– , Corollary 3.4 implies that the dual maps C n—X; A; G–!Ñ n—X; A; G– also induce isomorphisms Hn—X; A; G– ˇ Hn Ñ —X; A; G– . Cellular Cohomology. For a CW complex X this is deﬁned via the cellular cochain complex formed by the horizontal sequence in the following diagram, where coefﬁ- cients in a given group G are understood, and the cellular coboundary maps dn are Cohomology Groups Section 3.1 203 the compositions \u000enjn , making the triangles commute.

Furthermore, the cellular cochain com- plex fHn—Xn;Xn−1; G–; dng is isomorphic to the dual of the cellular chain complex, obtained by applying Hom—−;G– . Proof: The universal coefﬁcient theorem implies that Hk—Xn;Xn−1; G– … 0 for k ﬂ n . The long exact sequence of the pair —Xn;Xn−1– then gives isomorphisms Hk—Xn; G– ˇ Hk—Xn−1; G– for k ﬂ n , n − 1 . Hence by induction on n we obtain Hk—Xn; G– … 0if k>n . Thus the diagonal sequences in the preceding diagram are exact. The universal coefﬁcient theorem also gives Hk—X; Xn‡1; G– … 0 for k \u0014 n ‡ 1, so Hn—X; G– ˇ Hn—Xn‡1; G– . The diagram then yields isomorphisms Hn—X; G– ˇ Hn—Xn‡1; G– ˇ Ker \u000en ˇ Ker dn= Im \u000en−1 ˇ Ker dn= Im dn−1 For the second statement in the theorem we have the diagram - XX GH ();, k 1kk ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!

The ﬁrst and third vertical maps are isomorphisms by the universal coefﬁcient theorem, so it sufﬁces to show the diagram commutes. The ﬁrst square commutes by naturality of h , and commu- tativity of the second square was shown in the discussion of the long exact sequence of cohomology groups of a pair —X; A– . tu Mayer–Vietoris Sequences.

The inclusion Cn—A ‡ B– ˆ Cn—X– is a chain homotopy equivalence by Proposition 2.21, so the dual restriction map C n—X; G–!C n—A ‡ B; G– is also a chain homotopy equivalence, hence induces an isomorphism on cohomology as shown in the discussion of excision a couple pages back. The map has coordinates the two restrictions to A and B , and ' takes the difference of the restrictions to A \\ B , so it is obvious that ' is onto with kernel the image of . There is a relative Mayer–Vietoris sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Hn—X; Y ; G– -! Hn—A; C; G– \b Hn—B; D; G– -!

The vertical maps are restrictions. The second and third of these induce isomorphisms on cohomology, as we have seen, so by the ﬁve-lemma the ﬁrst vertical map also induces isomorphisms on cohomology. The relative Mayer–Vietoris sequence is then the long exact sequence associated to the short exact sequence of cochain complexes 0 -! C n—A ‡ B; C ‡ D; G– -----! C n—A; C; G– \b C n—B; D; G– ' -----!

Let hX; Y i denote the set of basepoint-preserving homotopy classes of basepoint- preserving maps X!Y .

In the introduction to this chapter we sketched a deﬁnition of cup product in terms of another product called cross product. However, to deﬁne the cross product from scratch takes some work, so we will proceed in the opposite order, ﬁrst giving an elementary deﬁnition of cup product by an explicit formula with simplices, then afterwards deﬁning cross product in terms of cup product. The other approach of deﬁning cup product via cross product is explained at the end of x3.B. To deﬁne the cup product we consider cohomology with coefﬁcients in a ring R , the most common choices being Z , Zn , and Q . For cochains ' 2 C k—X; R– and 2 C `—X; R– , the cup product ' ` 2 C k‡`—X; R– is the cochain whose value on a singular simplex ˙ : Ñ k‡`!X is given by the formula —' ` –—˙ – … '( ˙ jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄\u0001 ( ˙ jj ƒvk; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk‡`⁄\u0001 where the right-hand side is the product in R . To see that this cup product of cochains induces a cup product of cohomology classes we need a formula relating it to the coboundary map: Lemma 3.6. \u000e—'` – … \u000e'` ‡—−1– k'`\u000e for ' 2 C k—X; R– and 2 C `—X; R– . Proof: For ˙ : Ñ k‡`‡1!X we have —\u000e' ` –—˙ – … k‡1X i…0—−1– i'( ˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk‡1⁄\u0001 ( ˙ jjƒvk‡1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk‡`‡1⁄\u0001 —−1–k—' ` \u000e –—˙ – … k‡`‡1X i…k —−1– i'( ˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄\u0001 ( ˙ jjƒvk; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk‡`‡1⁄\u0001 When we add these two expressions, the last term of the ﬁrst sum cancels the ﬁrst term of the second sum, and the remaining terms are exactly \u000e—' ` –—˙ – … —' ` –—@˙ – since @˙ … Pk‡`‡1 i…0 —−1– i˙ jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk‡`‡1⁄ . tu Cup Product Section 3.2 207 From the formula \u000e—' ` – … \u000e' ` \u0006 ' ` \u000e it is apparent that the cup product of two cocycles is again a cocycle. Also, the cup product of a cocycle and a coboundary, in either order, is a coboundary since ' ` \u000e …\u0006\u000e—' ` – if \u000e' … 0, and \u000e' ` … \u000e—' ` – if \u000e … 0 . It follows that there is an induced cup product Hk—X; R– \u0002 H`—X; R– `-----------------------! Hk‡`—X; R– This is associative and distributive since at the level of cochains the cup product obviously has these properties. If R has an identity element, then there is an identity element for cup product, the class 1 2 H0—X; R– deﬁned by the 0 cocycle taking the value 1 on each singular 0 simplex. A cup product for simplicial cohomology can be deﬁned by the same formula as for singular cohomology, so the canonical isomorphism between simplicial and singu- lar cohomology respects cup products. Here are three examples of direct calculations of cup products using simplicial cohomology. Example 3.7. Let M be the closed orientable surface of genus g \u0015 1 with the Ñ complex structure shown in the ﬁgure for the case g … 2 . The cup product of interest is H1—M–\u0002 H1—M–!H2—M– . Taking Z coef- b b a a a a b b 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 ® 2® ¯ 2¯ + + ++ __ _ _ﬁcients, a basis for H1—M– is formed by the edges ai and bi , as we showed in Example 2.36 when we com- puted the homology of M using cellular homology. We have H1—M– ˇ Hom—H1—M–; Z– by cellular coho- mology or the universal coefﬁcient theorem. A basis for H1—M– determines a dual basis for Hom—H1—M–; Z– , so dual to ai is the coho- mology class \u000bi assigning the value 1 to ai and 0 to the other basis elements, and similarly we have cohomology classes \fi dual to bi . To represent \u000bi by a simplicial cocycle 'i we need to choose values for 'i on the edges radiating out from the central vertex in such a way that \u000e'i … 0 . This is the ‘cocycle condition’ discussed in the introduction to this chapter, where we saw that it has a geometric interpretation in terms of curves transverse to the edges of M . With this interpretation in mind, consider the arc labeled \u000bi in the ﬁgure, which represents a loop in M meeting ai in one point and disjoint from all the other basis elements aj and bj . We deﬁne 'i to have the value 1 on edges meeting the arc \u000bi and the value 0 on all other edges. Thus 'i counts the number of intersections of each edge with the arc \u000bi . In similar fashion we obtain a cocycle i counting intersections with the arc \fi , and i represents the cohomology class \fi dual to bi . Now we can compute cup products by applying the deﬁnition. Keeping in mind that the ordering of the vertices of each 2 simplex is compatible with the indicated orientations of its edges, we see for example that '1 ` 1 takes the value 0 on all 2 simplices except the one with outer edge b1 in the lower right part of the ﬁgure, 208 Chapter 3 Cohomology where it takes the value 1 . Thus '1` 1 takes the value 1 on the 2 chain c formed by the sum of all the 2 simplices with the signs indicated in the center of the ﬁgure. It is an easy calculation that @c … 0 . Since there are no 3 simplices, c is not a boundary, so it represents a nonzero element of H2—M– . The fact that —'1 ` 1–—c– is a generator of Z implies both that c represents a generator of H2—M– ˇ Z and that '1 ` 1 represents the dual generator γ of H2—M– ˇ Hom—H2—M–; Z– ˇ Z . Thus \u000b1 ` \f1 … γ . In similar fashion one computes: \u000bi ` \fj … 8 < : γ; i … j 0;i ﬂ j 9 = ; …−—\fi ` \u000bj–; \u000bi ` \u000bj … 0;\fi ` \fj … 0 These relations determine the cup product H1—M–\u0002 H1—M–!H2—M– completely since cup product is distributive. Notice that cup product is not commutative in this exam- ple since \u000bi ` \fi …−—\fi ` \u000bi– . We will show in Theorem 3.14 below that this is the worst that can happen: Cup product is commutative up to a sign depending only on dimension. One can see in this example that nonzero cup products of distinct classes \u000bi or \fj occur precisely when the corresponding loops \u000bi or \fj intersect. This is also true for the cup product of \u000bi or \fi with itself if we allow ourselves to take two copies of the corresponding loop and deform one of them to be disjoint from the other. Example 3.8. The closed nonorientable surface N of genus g can be treated in similar fashion if we use Z2 coefﬁcients. Using the Ñ complex structure shown, the edges ai give a basis for H1—N; Z2– , and a a a a a a a a 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 4 ® 3® ® 4®the dual basis elements \u000bi 2 H1—N; Z2– can be repre- sented by cocycles with values given by counting inter- sections with the arcs labeled \u000bi in the ﬁgure. Then one computes that \u000bi ` \u000bi is the nonzero element of H2—N; Z2– ˇ Z2 and \u000bi ` \u000bj … 0 for i ﬂ j . In particu- lar, when g … 1 we have N … RP2 , and the cup product of a generator of H1—RP2; Z2– with itself is a generator of H2—RP2; Z2– . The remarks in the paragraph preceding this example apply here also, but with the following difference: When one tries to deform a second copy of the loop \u000bi in the present example to be disjoint from the original copy, the best one can do is make it intersect the original in one point. This reﬂects the fact that \u000bi `\u000bi is now nonzero. Example 3.9. Let X be the 2 dimensional CW complex obtained by attaching a 2 cell to S 1 by the degree m map S 1!S 1 , z , zm . Using cellular cohomology, or cellular homology and the universal coefﬁcient theorem, we see that Hn—X; Z– consists of a Z for n … 0 and a Zm for n … 2 , so the cup product structure with Z coefﬁcients is uninteresting. However, with Zm coefﬁcients we have Hi—X; Zm– ˇ Zm for i … 0; 1; 2; Cup Product Section 3.2 209 so there is the possibility that the cup product of two 1 dimensional classes can be nontrivial. T T T T 0 1 2 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 e e e ev w ww w e 0 To obtain a Ñ complex structure on X , take a regular m gon subdivided into m triangles Ti around a central vertex v , as shown in the ﬁgure for the case m … 4 , then identify all the outer edges by rotations of the m gon. This gives X a Ñ complex structure with 2 vertices, m‡1 edges, and m 2 simplices. A generator \u000b of H1—X; Zm– is represented by a cocycle ' assigning the value 1 to the edge e , which generates H1—X– . The condition that ' be a cocycle means that '—ei– ‡ '—e– … '—ei‡1– for all i , subscripts being taken mod m . So we may take '—ei– … i 2 Zm . Hence —' ` '–—Ti– … '—ei–'—e– … i . The map h : H2—X; Zm–!Hom—H2—X; Zm–; Zm– is an isomorphism since P i Ti is a generator of H2—X; Zm– and there are 2 cocycles taking the value 1 on P i Ti , for example the cocycle taking the value 1 on one Ti and 0 on all the others. The cocycle ' ` ' takes the value 0 ‡ 1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ —m − 1– on Pi Ti , hence represents 0 ‡ 1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ —m − 1– times a generator \f of H2—X; Zm– .In Zm the sum 0 ‡ 1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ —m − 1– is0if m is odd and k if m … 2k since the terms 1 and m − 1 cancel, 2 and m − 2 cancel, and so on. Thus, writing \u000b2 for \u000b ` \u000b , we have \u000b2 … 0if m is odd and \u000b 2 … k\f if m … 2k . In particular, if m … 2, X is RP2 and \u000b 2 … \f in H2—RP2; Z2– , as we showed already in Example 3.8. The cup product formula —' ` –—˙ – … '( ˙ jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄\u0001 ( ˙ jj ƒvk; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk‡`⁄\u0001 also gives relative cup products Hk—X; R– \u0002 H`—X; A; R– `-----------------------!

Hk‡`—X; A; R– since if ' or vanishes on chains in A then so does ' ` . There is a more general relative cup product Hk—X; A; R– \u0002 H`—X; B; R– `-----------------------! Hk‡`—X; A [ B; R– when A and B are open subsets of X or subcomplexes of the CW complex X . This is obtained in the following way. The absolute cup product restricts to a cup product C k—X; A; R–\u0002 C `—X; B; R–!C k‡`—X; A ‡ B; R– where C n—X; A ‡ B; R– is the subgroup of C n—X; R– consisting of cochains vanishing on sums of chains in A and chains in B .If A and B are open in X , the inclusions C n—X; A [ B; R– > C n—X; A ‡ B; R– induce isomorphisms on cohomology, via the ﬁve-lemma and the fact that the restric- tion maps C n—A [ B; R–!C n—A ‡ B; R– induce isomorphisms on cohomology as we saw in the discussion of excision in the previous section. Therefore the cup product C k—X; A; R–\u0002 C `—X; B; R–!C k‡`—X; A ‡ B; R– induces the desired relative cup product 210 Chapter 3 Cohomology Hk—X; A; R–\u0002 H`—X; B; R–!Hk‡`—X; A [ B; R– . This holds also if X is a CW complex with A and B subcomplexes since here again the maps C n—A [ B; R–!C n—A ‡ B; R– induce isomorphisms on cohomology, as we saw for homology in x2.2. Proposition 3.10. For a map f : X!Y , the induced maps f \u0003 : Hn—Y ; R–!Hn—X; R– satisfy f \u0003—\u000b ` \f– … f \u0003—\u000b– ` f \u0003—\f– , and similarly in the relative case.

The absolute and general relative forms are the maps Hk—X; R– \u0002 H`—Y ; R– \u0002-----------------------! Hk‡`—X \u0002 Y ; R– Hk—X; A; R– \u0002 H`—Y ; B; R– \u0002-----------------------!

For the n dimensional torus T n , the product of n circles, let us show that all cohomology classes are cup products of 1 dimensional classes. More precisely, we show that Hk—T n; R– is a free R module with basis the cup products \u000bi1 ` \u0001\u0001\u0001 ` \u000bik for i1 < \u0001\u0001\u0001 <ik , where \u000bi 2 H1—T n; R– is p\u0003 i —\u000b– for \u000b a generator H1—S 1; R– and pi the projection of T n onto its i th factor. As a preliminary step we show that for \u000b a generator of H1—I; @I; R– , the map Hn—Y ; R–!Hn‡1—I \u0002 Y; @I \u0002 Y ; R–; \f , \u000b\u0002 \f is an isomorphism for all spaces Y . This uses commutativity of the following square: ARH () H (¡¡¡¡¡! H (¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!; YRH () kk 1; AYH ( £ ££ £ ££ XY£ AY£R) k ` 1; XA R) R) ; , ;¡¡¡¡¡!YRH ();, ± ± +k ++ +11`` ` To check this, start with an element of the upper left product, represented by cocycles ' 2 C k—A; R– and 2 C `—Y ; R– . Extend ' to a cochain ' 2 C k—X; R– . Then the pair —'; – maps rightward to —\u000e'; – and then downward to p] 1 —\u000e'– ` p] 2 — – . Going the other way around the square, —'; – maps downward to p] 1 —'– ` p] 2 — – and then rightward to \u000e( p] 1 —'– ` p] 2 — – \u0001 since p] 1 —'– ` p] 2 — – extends p] 1 —'– ` p] 2 — – over X \u0002 Y . Finally, \u000e( p] 1 —'– ` p] 2 — – \u0001 … p] 1 —\u000e'– ` p] 2 — – since \u000e … 0. Returning to the product I \u0002 Y , the long exact sequence for the pair —I \u0002 Y; @I \u0002 Y– breaks up into split short exact sequences 0 -! Hn—I \u0002 Y; R– -! Hn—@I \u0002 Y ; R– \u000e-----! Hn‡1—I \u0002 Y; @I \u0002 Y ; R– -! 0 Cup Product Section 3.2 211 The map \u000e is an isomorphism when restricted to the copy of Hn—Y ; R– corresponding to f0g\u0002 Y . This copy of Hn—Y ; R– consists of elements of the form 10 \u0002 \f where 10 2 H0—@I; R– is represented by the cocycle that is 1 on 0 2 @I and0on1 2 @I . By the commutative square above, \u000e—10 \u0002 \f– … \u000e—10–\u0002 \f . The element \u000e—10– is a generator of H1—I; @I; R– , by the case that Y is a point. Any other generator \u000b is a scalar multiple of \u000e—10– by a unit of R , so this shows the map \f , \u000b\u0002 \f is an isomorphism. An equivalent statement is that the map Hn—Y ; R–!Hn‡1—S 1 \u0002 Y; fs0g\u0002 Y ; R– , \f , \u000b\u0002 \f , is an isomorphism, with \u000b now a generator of H1—S 1;s0; R– . Via the long exact sequence of the pair —S 1 \u0002 Y; fs0g\u0002 Y– , this implies that the map Hn‡1—Y ; R–\u0002 Hn—Y ; R–!Hn‡1—S 1 \u0002 Y ; R–; —\f1;\f2– , 1\u0002 \f1 ‡ \u000b\u0002 \f2 is an isomorphism, with \u000b a generator of H1—S 1; R– . Specializing to the case of the n torus, we conclude by induction on n that Hk—T n; R– has the structure described at the beginning of the example. We can use this calculation to deduce a fact that will be used shortly in the calcula- tion of cup products in projective spaces. Writing n … i‡j , the cube In is the product Ii \u0002 Ij , and the assertion is that the cross product of generators of Hi—Ii;@Ii; R– and H j—Ij;@Ij; R– is a generator of Hn—In;@In; R– , where we are using the ﬁrst of the following three cross products: Hi—Ii;@Ii; R– \u0002 Hj—Ij;@Ij; R– \u0002-----------------------! Hn—In;@In; R– Hi—T i; ˙T i; R– \u0002 Hj—T j; ˙T j; R– \u0002-----------------------! Hn—T n; ˙T n; R– Hi—T i; R– \u0002 Hj—T j; R– \u0002-----------------------! Hn—T n; R– In the second cross product, the dots denote deletion of the top-dimensional cell. All three cross products are equivalent. This is evident for the ﬁrst two, thinking of the torus as a quotient of a cube. For the second two, note that all cellular boundary maps for T n with Z coefﬁcients must be trivial, otherwise the cohomology groups would be smaller than computed above. Hence all cellular coboundary maps with arbitrary coefﬁcients are zero, and the map Hn—T n; ˙T n; R–!Hn—T n; R– is an isomorphism. The corresponding results for T i and T j are of course true as well. Since cross product is associative, the earlier calculation shows that for the last of the three cross products above, the cross product of generators is a generator, so this is also true for the ﬁrst cross product. The Cohomology Ring Since cup product is associative and distributive, it is natural to try to make it the multiplication in a ring structure on the cohomology groups of a space X . This is easy to do if we simply deﬁne H\u0003—X; R– to be the direct sum of the groups Hn—X; R– . Elements of H\u0003—X; R– are ﬁnite sums P i \u000bi with \u000bi 2 Hi—X; R– , and the product of 212 Chapter 3 Cohomology two such sums is deﬁned to be (P i \u000bi\u0001(P j \fj\u0001 … P i;j \u000bi\fj . It is routine to check that this makes H\u0003—X; R– into a ring, with identity if R has an identity. Similarly, H\u0003—X; A; R– is a ring via the relative cup product. Taking scalar multiplication by elements of R into account, these rings can also be regarded as R algebras. For example, the calculations in Example 3.8 or 3.9 above show that H\u0003—RP2; Z2– consists of the polynomials a0 ‡a1\u000b‡a2\u000b 2 with coefﬁcients ai 2 Z2 ,so H\u0003—RP2; Z2– is the quotient Z2ƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b 3– of the polynomial ring Z2ƒ\u000b⁄ by the ideal generated by \u000b 3 . This example illustrates how H\u0003—X; R– often has a more compact description than the sequence of individual groups Hn—X; R– , so there is a certain economy in the change of scale that comes from regarding all the groups Hn—X; R– as part of a single object H\u0003—X; R– . Adding cohomology classes of different dimensions to form H\u0003—X; R– is a conve- nient formal device, but it has little topological signiﬁcance. One always regards the cohomology ring as a graded ring: a ring A with a decomposition as a sum L k\u00150Ak of additive subgroups Ak such that the multiplication takes Ak \u0002 A` to Ak‡` . To in- dicate that an element a 2 A lies in Ak we write jaj… k . This applies in particular to elements of Hk—X; R– . Some authors call jaj the ‘degree’ of a , but we will use the term ‘dimension’ which is more geometric and avoids potential confusion with the degree of a polynomial. Among the simplest graded rings are polynomial rings Rƒ\u000b⁄ and their truncated versions Rƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b n– , consisting of polynomials of degree less than n . The example we have seen is H\u0003—RP2; Z2– ˇ Z2ƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b 3– . Generalizing this, we have: Theorem 3.12. H\u0003—RPn; Z2– ˇ Z2ƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b n‡1– and H\u0003—RP1; Z2– ˇ Z2ƒ\u000b⁄ , where j\u000bj… 1 . In the complex case, H\u0003—CPn; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b n‡1– and H\u0003—CP1; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b⁄ where j\u000bj… 2 . This turns out to be a quite important result, and it can be proved in a number of different ways. The proof we give here consists of a direct reduction to the relative cup product calculation in Example 3.11 above. Another proof using Poincar´e duality will be given in Example 3.40. A third proof is contained in x4.D as an application of the Gysin sequence. Proof: Let us do the case of RPn ﬁrst. To simplify notation we abbreviate RPn to P n and we let the coefﬁcient group Z2 be implicit. Since the inclusion P n−1>P n induces an isomorphism on Hi for i \u0014 n − 1 , it sufﬁces by induction on n to show that the cup product of a generator of Hn−1—P n– with a generator of H1—P n– is a generator of Hn—P n– . It will be no more work to show more generally that the cup product of a generator of Hi—P n– with a generator of Hn−i—P n– is a generator of Hn—P n– .As a further notational aid, we let j … n − i ,so i ‡ j … n . The proof uses some of the geometric structure of P n . Recall that P n consists of nonzero vectors —x0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn– 2 Rn‡1 modulo multiplication by nonzero scalars. In- Cup Product Section 3.2 213 side P n is a copy of P i represented by vectors whose last j coordinates xi‡1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn are zero. We also have a copy of P j represented by points whose ﬁrst i coordi- nates x0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xi−1 are zero. The intersection P i \\ P j is a single point p , represented by vectors whose only nonzero coordinate is xi . Let U be the subspace of P n represented by vectors with nonzero coordinate xi . Each point in U may be rep- P j P i P n - 1 P i - 1 P i - 1 presented by a unique vector with xi … 1 and the other n coordinates arbitrary, so U is homeomorphic to Rn , with p corresponding to 0 under this homeomorphism. We can write this Rn as R i \u0002 Rj , with R i as the coordinates x0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xi−1 and R j as the coordinates xi‡1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn . In the ﬁgure P n is represented as a disk with antipodal points of its boundary sphere identiﬁed to form a P n−1 ˆ P n with U … P n − P n−1 the interior of the disk. Consider the diagram PH () in PH () jn PH () nn £ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! PH () in P n P j PH () jn PH (){} nn £ ¡¡¡¡¡!, - P n Pp i , - P n , - RH () in Rn Rj RH () jn RH (){} nn £ ¡¡¡¡¡!, -Rn R 0 i , -Rn , -¡¡!¡¡! ¡¡!¡¡! which commutes by naturality of cup product. The lower cup product map takes generator cross generator to generator, as we showed in Example 3.11 above in the equivalent situation of a product of cubes. The same will be true for the top row if the four vertical maps are isomorphisms, so this is what remains to be proved. The lower map in the right column is an isomorphism by excision. For the upper map in this column, the fact that P n −fpg deformation retracts to a P n−1 gives an isomorphism Hn—P n;P n −f0g– ˇ Hn—P n;P n−1– via the ﬁve-lemma applied to the long exact sequences for these pairs. And Hn—P n;P n−1– ˇ Hn—P n– by cellular cohomology. To see that the vertical maps in the left column are isomorphisms we use the following commutative diagram: ){}p PH () in PH () in P n P j , -PH () in P, RH () in Rn Rj ){}¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡! , - 0¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! -i 1 PH () ii PH ( ii P i , -PH () ii P, RH ( ii Ri¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! , - -i 1 If we can show all these maps are isomorphisms, then the same argument will apply with i and j interchanged, and the proof for RPn will be ﬁnished. The left-hand square consists of isomorphisms by cellular cohomology. The right- hand vertical map is obviously an isomorphism. The lower right horizontal map is an isomorphism by excision, and the map to the left of this is an isomorphism since P i −fpg deformation retracts onto P i−1 . The remaining maps will be isomorphisms if the middle map in the upper row is an isomorphism. And this map is in fact 214 Chapter 3 Cohomology an isomorphism because P n − P j deformation retracts onto P i−1 by the following argument. The subspace P n − P j ˆ P n consists of points represented by vectors v … —x0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn– with at least one of the coordinates x0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xi−1 nonzero. The formula ft—v– … —x0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xi−1;txi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;txn– for t decreasing from 1 to 0 gives a well-deﬁned deformation retraction of P n − P j onto P i−1 since ft—\u0015v– … \u0015ft—v– for scalars \u0015 2 R . The case of RP1 follows from the ﬁnite-dimensional case since the inclusion RPn > RP1 induces isomorphisms on Hi—−; Z2– for i \u0014 n by cellular cohomology. Complex projective spaces are handled in precisely the same way, using Z coef- ﬁcients and replacing each Hk by H2k and R by C . tu There are also quaternionic projective spaces HPn and HP1 , deﬁned exactly as in the complex case, with CW structures of the form e0 [ e4 [ e8 [ \u0001\u0001\u0001 . Associa- tivity of quaternion multiplication is needed for the identiﬁcation v ˘ \u0015v to be an equivalence relation, so the deﬁnition does not extend to octonionic projective spaces, though there is an octonionic projective plane OP2 that will be deﬁned in x4.3. The cup product structure in quaternionic projective spaces is just like that in complex projective spaces, except that the generator is 4 dimensional: H\u0003—HP1; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b⁄ and H\u0003—HPn; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b n‡1–; with j\u000bj… 4 The same proof as in the real and complex cases works as well in this case. The cup product structure for RP1 with Z coefﬁcients can easily be deduced from the cup product structure with Z2 coefﬁcients, as follows. In general, a ring homomorphism R!S induces a ring homomorphism H\u0003—X; A; R–!H\u0003—X; A; S– .In the case of the projection Z!Z2 we get for RP1 an induced chain map of cellular cochain complexes with Z and Z2 coefﬁcients: ZZ ZZZ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!0 0 2200 000... 22¡¡¡¡¡!2¡¡¡¡¡!2¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!2¡¡¡¡¡!ZZ¡¡¡¡¡!0... Z¡¡¡¡¡!Z¡¡¡¡¡!Z¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! From this we see that the ring homomorphism H\u0003—RP1; Z–!H\u0003—RP1; Z2– is injec- tive in positive dimensions, with image the even-dimensional part of H\u0003—RP1; Z2– . Alternatively, this could be deduced from the universal coefﬁcient theorem. Hence we have H\u0003—RP1; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b⁄=—2\u000b– with j\u000bj… 2. The cup product structure in H\u0003—RPn; Z– can be computed in a similar fashion, though the description is a little cumbersome: H\u0003—RP2k; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b⁄=—2\u000b; \u000b k‡1–; j\u000bj… 2 H\u0003—RP2k‡1; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b; \f⁄=—2\u000b; \u000b k‡1;\f 2; \u000b\f–; j\u000bj… 2; j\fj… 2k ‡ 1 Here \f is a generator of H2k‡1—RP2k‡1; Z– ˇ Z . From this calculation we see that the rings H\u0003—RP2k‡1; Z– and H\u0003—RP2k _ S 2k‡1; Z– are isomorphic, though with Z2 Cup Product Section 3.2 215 coefﬁcients this is no longer true, as the generator \u000b 2 H1—RP2k‡1; Z2– has \u000b 2k‡1 ﬂ 0, while \u000b2k‡1 … 0 for the generator \u000b 2 H1—RP2k _ S 2k‡1; Z2– . Induced homomorphisms are ring homomorphisms by Proposition 3.10. Here is an example illustrating this fact. Example 3.13. The isomorphism H\u0003—` \u000b X\u000b; R– ˇ-----! Q \u000b H\u0003—X\u000b; R– whose coordinates are induced by the inclusions i\u000b : X\u000b > ` \u000b X\u000b is a ring isomorphism with respect to the usual coordinatewise multiplication in a product ring, because each coordinate function i\u0003 \u000b is a ring homomorphism. Similarly for a wedge sum the isomorphism eH\u0003—W \u000b X\u000b; R– ˇ Q \u000b eH\u0003—X\u000b; R– is a ring isomorphism. Here we take reduced cohomol- ogy to be cohomology relative to a basepoint, and we use relative cup products. We should assume the basepoints x\u000b 2 X\u000b are deformation retracts of neighborhoods, to be sure that the claimed isomorphism does indeed hold. This product ring structure for wedge sums can sometimes be used to rule out splittings of a space as a wedge sum up to homotopy equivalence. For example, con- sider CP2 , which is S 2 with a cell e4 attached by a certain map f : S 3!S 2 . Using homology or just the additive structure of cohomology it is impossible to conclude that CP2 is not homotopy equivalent to S 2 _ S 4 , and hence that f is not homotopic to a constant map. However, with cup products we can distinguish these two spaces since the square of each element of H2—S 2 _ S 4; Z– is zero in view of the ring iso- morphism eH\u0003—S 2 _ S 4; Z– ˇ eH\u0003—S 2; Z–\b eH\u0003—S 4; Z– , but the square of a generator of H2—CP2; Z– is nonzero by Theorem 3.12. More generally, cup products can be used to distinguish inﬁnitely many different homotopy classes of maps S 4n−1!S 2n for all n \u0015 1 . This is systematized in the notion of the Hopf invariant , which is studied in x4.B. The natural question of whether the cohomology ring is commutative is answered by the following: Theorem 3.14. The identity \u000b ` \f … —−1– k`\f ` \u000b holds for all \u000b 2 Hk—X; A; R– and \f 2 H`—X; A; R– , when R is commutative. Taking \u000b … \f , this implies in particular that if \u000b is an element of Hk—X; A; R– with k odd, then 2\u000b2 … 0in H2k—X; A; R– . Hence if H2k—X; A; R– has no elements of order two, then \u000b2 … 0 . For example, if X is the 2 complex obtained by attaching a disk to S 1 by a map of degree m as in Example 3.9 above, then we can deduce that the square of a generator of H1—X; Zm– is zero if m is odd, and is either zero or the unique element of H2—X; Zm– ˇ Zm of order two if m is even. As we showed, the square is in fact nonzero when m is even. A graded ring satisfying the commutativity property of the theorem is usually called simply commutative in the context of algebraic topology, in spite of the po- tential for misunderstanding. In the older literature one ﬁnds less ambiguous terms such as graded commutative, anticommutative,or skew commutative. 216 Chapter 3 Cohomology Proof: Consider ﬁrst the case A …; . For cochains ' 2 C k—X; R– and 2 C `—X; R– one can see from the deﬁnition that the cup products ' ` and ` ' differ only by a permutation of the vertices of Ñk‡` . The idea of the proof is to study a particularly nice permutation of vertices, namely the one that totally reverses their order, replacing ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ by ƒvn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;v0⁄ . This has the convenient feature of also reversing the ordering of vertices in any face. For a singular n simplex ˙ : ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄!X , let ˙ be the singular n simplex obtained by preceding ˙ by the linear homeomorphism of ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ reversing the order of the vertices. Thus ˙—vi– … ˙—vn−i– . This reversal of vertices is the product of n ‡ —n − 1– ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ 1 … n—n ‡ 1–=2 transpositions of adjacent vertices, each of which reverses orientation of the n simplex since it is a reﬂection across an —n − 1– dimensional hyperplane. So to take orientations into account we would expect that a sign \"n … —−1– n—n‡1–=2 ought to be inserted. Hence we deﬁne a homomorphism ˆ : Cn—X–!Cn—X– by ˆ—˙ – … \"n˙ . We will show that ˆ is a chain map, chain homotopic to the identity, so it induces the identity on cohomology. From this the theorem quickly follows. Namely, the formulas —ˆ\u0003' ` ˆ\u0003 –—˙ – … '( \"k˙ jjƒvk; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;v0⁄\u0001 ( \"`˙ jjƒvk‡`; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄\u0001 ˆ\u0003— ` '–—˙ – … \"k‡` ( ˙ jjƒvk‡`; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄\u0001 '( ˙ jjƒvk; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;v0⁄\u0001 show that \"k\"`—ˆ\u0003' ` ˆ\u0003 – … \"k‡`ˆ\u0003— ` '– , since we assume R is commutative. A trivial calculation gives \"k‡` … —−1– k`\"k\"` , hence ˆ\u0003' ` ˆ\u0003 … —−1– k`ˆ\u0003— ` '– . Since ˆ is chain homotopic to the identity, the ˆ\u0003 ’s disappear when we pass to coho- mology classes, and so we obtain the desired formula \u000b ` \f … —−1– k`\f ` \u000b . The chain map property @ˆ … ˆ@ can be veriﬁed by calculating, for a singular n simplex ˙ , @ˆ—˙ – … \"n X i —−1– i˙ jjƒvn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvn−i; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;v0⁄ ˆ@—˙ – … ˆ\u0010X i —−1– i˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄\u0011 … \"n−1 X i —−1– n−i˙ jjƒvn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvn−i; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;v0⁄ which reduces us to the easily checked identity \"n … —−1– n\"n−1 . To deﬁne a chain homotopy between ˆ and the identity we are motivated by the construction of the prism operator P in the proof that homotopic maps induce the same homomorphism on homology, in Theorem 2.10. The main ingredient in the construction of P was a subdivision of Ñn \u0002 I into —n ‡ 1– simplices with ver- tices vi in Ñn \u0002f0g and wi in Ñn \u0002f1g , the vertex wi lying directly above vi . Using the same subdivision, and letting ˇ : Ñn \u0002 I!Ñn be the projection, we now deﬁne P : Cn—X–!Cn‡1—X– by P—˙ – … X i —−1– i\"n−i—˙ ˇ – jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wi⁄ Cup Product Section 3.2 217 Thus the w vertices are written in reverse order, and there is a compensating sign \"n−i . One can view this formula as arising from the Ñ complex structure on Ñ n \u0002 I in which the vertices are ordered v0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn;wn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;w0 rather than the more natural ordering v0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn;w0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn . To show @P ‡ P@ … ˆ − 11 we ﬁrst calculate @P , leaving out ˙ ’s and ˙ˇ ’s for notational simplicity: @P … X j\u0014i —−1– i—−1– j\"n−iƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvj; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wi⁄ ‡ X j\u0015i—−1– i—−1– i‡1‡n−j\"n−iƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; cwj; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wi⁄ The j … i terms in these two sums give \"nƒwn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;w0⁄ ‡ X i>0 \"n−iƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi−1;wn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wi⁄ ‡ X i<n —−1– n‡i‡1\"n−iƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wi‡1⁄ − ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ In this expression the two summation terms cancel since replacing i by i − 1 in the second sum produces a new sign —−1–n‡i\"n−i‡1 …−\"n−i . The remaining two terms \"nƒwn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;w0⁄ and −ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ represent ˆ—˙ – − ˙ . So in order to show that @P ‡ P@ … ˆ − 11 , it remains to check that in the formula for @P above, the terms with j ﬂ i give −P@ . Calculating P@ from the deﬁnitions, we have P@ … X i<j—−1– i—−1– j\"n−i−1ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; cwj; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wi⁄ ‡ X i>j—−1– i−1—−1– j\"n−iƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvj; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi;wn; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wi⁄ Since \"n−i … —−1–n−i\"n−i−1 , this ﬁnishes the veriﬁcation that @P ‡ P@ … ˆ − 11 , and so the theorem is proved when A …; . The proof also applies when A ﬂ ; since the maps ˆ and P take chains in A to chains in A , so the dual homomorphisms ˆ\u0003 and P \u0003 act on relative cochains. tu Example 3.15: Exterior Algebras. In general, the exterior algebra ÓRƒ\u000b1;\u000b2; \u0001\u0001\u0001⁄ over a commutative ring R with identity is the free R module with basis the ﬁnite products \u000bi1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u000bik , i1 < \u0001\u0001\u0001 <ik , with multiplication deﬁned by the rules \u000bi\u000bj … −\u000bj\u000bi and \u000b2 i … 0 , the latter relation being a special case of the former if 2 ﬂ 0 in R . The empty product of \u000bi ’s is allowed, and provides an identity element 1 in ÓRƒ\u000b1;\u000b2; \u0001\u0001\u0001⁄ . The calculation of cup products in the n torus T n in Example 3.11 shows that H\u0003—T n; R– is the exterior algebra ÓRƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn⁄ . The same is true for any product of odd-dimensional spheres, as could be proved by a continuation of the calculation for the torus or by simply quoting Theorem 3.16 below. 218 Chapter 3 Cohomology AK¨unneth Formula One might guess that there should be some connection between cup product and product spaces, and indeed this is the case, as we will show in this subsection. To begin, we deﬁne the cross product,or external cup product as it is sometimes called. This is the map H\u0003—X; R– \u0002 H\u0003—Y ; R– \u0002-----------------------! H\u0003—X \u0002 Y ; R– given by a\u0002 b … p\u0003 1 —a– ` p\u0003 2 —b– where p1 and p2 are the projections of X \u0002 Y onto X and Y . Since cup product is distributive, the cross product is bilinear, that is, linear in each variable separately. We might hope that the cross product map would be an isomorphism in many cases, thereby giving a nice description of the cohomology rings of these product spaces. However, a bilinear map is rarely a homomorphism, so it could hardly be an isomorphism. Fortunately there is a nice algebraic solution to this problem, and that is to replace the direct product H\u0003—X; R–\u0002 H\u0003—Y ; R– by the tensor product H\u0003—X; R– ⊗R H\u0003—Y ; R– . Let us review the deﬁnition and basic properties of tensor product. For abelian groups A and B the tensor product A ⊗ B is deﬁned to be the abelian group with generators a ⊗ b for a 2 A , b 2 B , and relations —a ‡ a 0– ⊗ b … a ⊗ b ‡ a0 ⊗ b and a ⊗ —b ‡ b0– … a ⊗ b ‡ a ⊗ b0 . So the zero element of A ⊗ B is 0 ⊗ 0 … 0 ⊗ b … a ⊗ 0 , and −—a ⊗ b– …−a ⊗ b … a ⊗ —−b– . Some readily veriﬁed elementary properties are: (1) A ⊗ B ˇ B ⊗ A . (2) —LiAi– ⊗ B ˇ L i—Ai ⊗ B– . (3) —A ⊗ B– ⊗ C ˇ A ⊗ —B ⊗ C– . (4) Z ⊗ A ˇ A . (5) Zn ⊗ A ˇ A=nA . (6) A pair of homomorphisms f : A!A 0 and g : B!B0 induces a homomorphism f ⊗ g : A ⊗ B!A0 ⊗ B0 via —f ⊗ g–—a ⊗ b– … f —a– ⊗ g—b– . (7) A bilinear map ' : A\u0002 B!C induces a homomorphism A ⊗ B!C sending a ⊗ b to '—a; b– . In (1)–(5) the isomorphisms are the obvious ones, for example a ⊗ b , b ⊗ a in (1) and n ⊗ a , na in (4). Properties (1), (2), (4), and (5) allow the calculation of tensor products of ﬁnitely generated abelian groups. The generalization to tensor product of modules over a commutative ring R is easy. One deﬁnes A ⊗R B for R modules A and B to be the quotient of A ⊗ B obtained by imposing the further relations ra ⊗ b … a ⊗ rb for r 2 R , a 2 A , and b 2 B . This relation guarantees that A ⊗R B is again an R module. In case R is not commutative, one assumes A is a right R module and B is a left R module, and the relation is written instead ar ⊗ b … a ⊗ rb , but now A ⊗R B is only an abelian group, not an R module necessarily. It is an easy algebra exercise to see that A ⊗R B … A ⊗ B when R Cup Product Section 3.2 219 is Zm or Q . But in general A ⊗R B is not the same as A ⊗ B . For example, if R … Q—\u0000 2– , a2 dimensional vector space over Q , then R ⊗R R … R but R ⊗ R is a 4 dimensional vector space over Q . The statements (1)–(3), (6), and (7) remain valid for tensor products of R modules. The generalization of (4) is the canonical isomorphism R ⊗R A ˇ A , r ⊗ a , ra . Property (7) of tensor products guarantees that the cross product as deﬁned above gives rise to a homomorphism H\u0003—X; R– ⊗R H\u0003—Y ; R– \u0002-----------------------! H\u0003—X \u0002 Y ; R–; a ⊗ b , a\u0002 b which we shall also call cross product. This map becomes a ring homomorphism if we deﬁne the multiplication in a tensor product of graded rings by —a ⊗ b–—c ⊗ d– … —−1–jbjjcjac ⊗ bd where jxj denotes the dimension of x . Namely, the cross product map sends —a ⊗ b–—c ⊗ d– … —−1– jbjjcjac ⊗ bd to —−1–jbjjcjac \u0002 bd … —−1– jbjjcjp\u0003 1 —a ` c– ` p\u0003 2 —b ` d– … —−1–jbjjcjp\u0003 1 —a– ` p\u0003 1 —c– ` p\u0003 2 —b– ` p\u0003 2 —d– … p\u0003 1 —a– ` p\u0003 2 —b– ` p\u0003 1 —c– ` p\u0003 2 —d– … —a\u0002 b–—c \u0002 d– which is the product of the images of a ⊗ b and c ⊗ d . Theorem 3.16. The cross product H\u0003—X; R– ⊗R H\u0003—Y ; R–!H\u0003—X \u0002 Y ; R– is an iso- morphism of rings if X and Y are CW complexes and Hk—Y ; R– is a ﬁnitely generated free R module for all k . Results of this type, computing homology or cohomology of a product space, are known as K¨unneth formulas. The hypothesis that X and Y are CW complexes will be shown to be unnecessary in x4.1 when we consider CW approximations to arbitrary spaces. On the other hand, the freeness hypothesis cannot always be dispensed with, as we shall see in x3.B when we obtain a completely general K¨unneth formula for the homology of a product space. When the conclusion of the theorem holds, the ring structure in H\u0003—X \u0002 Y ; R– is determined by the ring structures in H\u0003—X; R– and H\u0003—Y ; R– . Example 3E.6 shows that some hypotheses are necessary in order for this to be true. Before proving the theorem, let us look at some examples. Example 3.17. The theorem says that H\u0003—RP1 \u0002 RP1; Z2– is isomorphic as a ring to H\u0003—RP1; Z2– ⊗ H\u0003—RP1; Z2– . By Theorem 3.12 this is Z2ƒ\u000b⁄ ⊗ Z2ƒ\f⁄ , which is just the polynomial ring Z2ƒ\u000b; \f⁄ . More generally we see by induction that for a product of n copies of RP1 , the Z2 cohomology is a polynomial ring in n variables. Similar remarks apply to CP1 and HP1 with coefﬁcients in an arbitrary commutative ring. 220 Chapter 3 Cohomology Example 3.18. The exterior algebra ÓRƒ\u000b1;\u000b2; \u0001\u0001\u0001⁄ is the graded tensor product over R of the one-variable exterior algebras ÓRƒ\u000bi⁄ where the \u000bi ’s have odd di- mension. The K¨unneth formula then gives an isomorphism H\u0003—S k1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 S kn ; Z– ˇ ÓZƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn⁄ if the dimensions ki are all odd. With some ki ’s even, one would have the tensor product of an exterior algebra for the odd-dimensional spheres and truncated polynomial rings Zƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b2– for the even-dimensional spheres. Of course, ÓZƒ\u000b⁄ and Zƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b 2– are isomorphic as rings, but when one takes tensor products in the graded sense it becomes important to distinguish them as graded rings, with \u000b odd-dimensional in ÓZƒ\u000b⁄ and even-dimensional in Zƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b 2– . These remarks apply more generally with any coefﬁcient ring R in place of Z , though when R … Z2 there is no need to distinguish between the odd-dimensional and even-dimensional cases since signs become irrelevant. The idea of the proof of the theorem will be to consider, for a ﬁxed CW complex Y , the functors hn—X; A– … L i ( Hi—X; A; R–⊗R Hn−i—Y ; R–\u0001 kn—X; A– … Hn—X \u0002 Y; A\u0002 Y ; R– The cross product, or a relative version of it, deﬁnes a map \u0016 : h n—X; A–!kn—X; A– which we want to show is an isomorphism when X is a CW complex and A …; .We will show: (1) h\u0003 and k\u0003 are cohomology theories on the category of CW pairs. (2) \u0016 is a natural transformation: It commutes with induced homomorphisms and with coboundary homomorphisms in long exact sequences of pairs. It is obvious that \u0016 : h n—X–!k n—X– is an isomorphism when X is a point since it is just the scalar multiplication map R ⊗R Hn—Y ; R–!Hn—Y ; R– . The following general fact will then imply the theorem. Proposition 3.19. If a natural transformation between unreduced cohomology the- ories on the category of CW pairs is an isomorphism when the CW pair is —point ; ;– , then it is an isomorphism for all CW pairs. Proof: Let \u0016 : h \u0003—X; A–!k\u0003—X; A– be the natural transformation. By the ﬁve-lemma it will sufﬁce to show that \u0016 is an isomorphism when A …; . First we do the case of ﬁnite-dimensional X by induction on dimension. The induction starts with the case that X is 0 dimensional, where the result holds by hypothesis and by the axiom for disjoint unions. For the induction step, \u0016 gives a map between the two long exact sequences for the pair —Xn;Xn−1– , with com- muting squares since \u0016 is a natural transformation. The ﬁve-lemma reduces the inductive step to showing that \u0016 is an isomorphism for —X; A– … —Xn;Xn−1– . Let Ø : ` \u000b —Dn \u000b;@Dn \u000b–!—Xn;Xn−1– be a collection of characteristic maps for all the n cells of X . By excision, Ø\u0003 is an isomorphism for h \u0003 and k\u0003 , so by naturality it sufﬁces Cup Product Section 3.2 221 to show that \u0016 is an isomorphism for —X; A– … ` \u000b —Dn \u000b;@Dn \u000b– . The axiom for dis- joint unions gives a further reduction to the case of the pair —Dn;@Dn– . Finally, this case follows by applying the ﬁve-lemma to the long exact sequences of this pair, since Dn is contractible and hence is covered by the 0 dimensional case, and @Dn is —n − 1– dimensional. The case that X is inﬁnite-dimensional reduces to the ﬁnite-dimensional case by a telescope argument as in the proof of Lemma 2.34. We leave this for the reader since the ﬁnite-dimensional case sufﬁces for the special h \u0003 and k \u0003 we are considering, as hi—X; Xn– and ki—X; Xn– are both zero when n \u0015 i , by cellular cohomology for example. tu Proof of 3.16: It remains to check that h \u0003 and k\u0003 are cohomology theories, and that \u0016 is a natural transformation. Since we are dealing with unreduced cohomology theories there are four axioms to verify. (1) Homotopy invariance: f ' g implies f \u0003 … g\u0003 . This is obvious for both h \u0003 and k\u0003 . (2) Excision: h \u0003—X; A– ˇ h \u0003—B; A \\ B– for A and B subcomplexes of the CW complex X … A [ B . This is obvious, and so is the corresponding statement for k \u0003 since —A\u0002 Y– [ —B \u0002 Y– … —A [ B–\u0002 Y and —A\u0002 Y– \\ —B \u0002 Y– … —A \\ B–\u0002 Y . (3) The long exact sequence of a pair. This is a triviality for k\u0003 , but a few words of explanation are needed for h\u0003 , where the desired exact sequence is obtained in two steps. For the ﬁrst step, tensor the long exact sequence of ordinary coho- mology groups for a pair —X; A– with the free R module Hn—Y ; R– , for a ﬁxed n . This yields another exact sequence because Hn—Y ; R– is a direct sum of copies of R , so the result of tensoring an exact sequence with this direct sum is simply to produce a direct sum of copies of the exact sequence, which is again an exact sequence. The second step is to let n vary, taking a direct sum of the previously constructed exact sequences for each n , with the n th exact sequence shifted up by n dimensions. (4) Disjoint unions. Again this axiom obviously holds for k \u0003 , but some justiﬁcation is required for h\u0003 . What is needed is the algebraic fact that there is a canoni- cal isomorphism (Q \u000b M\u000b\u0001 ⊗R N ˇ Q \u000b ( M\u000b ⊗R N\u0001 for R modules M\u000b and a ﬁnitely generated free R module N . Since N is a direct product of ﬁnitely many copies R\f of R , M\u000b ⊗R N is a direct product of corresponding copies M\u000b\f … M\u000b ⊗R R\f of M\u000b and the desired relation becomes Q \f Q \u000b M\u000b\f ˇ Q \u000b Q \f M\u000b\f , which is obviously true. Finally there is naturality of \u0016 to consider. Naturality with respect to maps between spaces is immediate from the naturality of cup products. Naturality with respect to coboundary maps in long exact sequences is commutativity of the square displayed in Example 3.11. tu 222 Chapter 3 Cohomology The following theorem of Hopf is a nice algebraic application of the cup product structure in H\u0003—RPn \u0002 RPn; Z2– described by the K¨unneth formula. Theorem 3.20. If R n has the structure of a division algebra over the scalar ﬁeld R , then n must be a power of 2 . Proof: Given a division algebra structure on R n , deﬁne a map g : S n−1 \u0002 S n−1!S n−1 by g—x; y– … xy=jxyj . This is well-deﬁned since there are no zero divisors, and con- tinuous by the bilinearity of the multiplication. From the relations —−x–y …−—xy– … x—−y– it follows that g—−x; y– …−g—x; y– … g—x; −y– . This implies that g induces a quotient map h : RPn−1 \u0002 RPn−1!RPn−1 . We claim that h\u0003 : H1—RPn−1; Z2–!H1—RPn−1 \u0002 RPn−1; Z2– is the map h \u0003—γ– … \u000b ‡ \f where γ generates H1—RPn−1; Z2– and \u000b and \f are the pullbacks of γ under the projections of RPn−1 \u0002 RPn−1 onto its two factors. This can be proved as follows. We may assume n> 2, so ˇ1—RPn−1– ˇ Z2 . Let \u0015 : I!S n−1 be a path joining a point x to the antipodal point −x . Then for ﬁxed y , the path s , g—\u0015—s–; y– joins g—x; y– to g—−x; y– …−g—x; y– . Hence, identifying antipodal points, h takes a nontrivial loop in the ﬁrst RPn−1 factor of RPn−1 \u0002 RPn−1 to a nontrivial loop in RPn−1 . The same argument works for the second factor, so the restriction of h to the 1 skeleton S 1 _S 1 is homotopic to the map that includes each S 1 summand of S 1 _S 1 into RPn−1 as the 1 skeleton. Since restriction to the 1 skeleton is an isomorphism on H1—−; Z2– for both RPn−1 and RPn−1 \u0002 RPn−1 , it follows that h \u0003—γ– … \u000b ‡ \f . Since γn … 0 we have 0 … h \u0003—γn– … —\u000b ‡ \f– n … Pk \u0010 n k\u0011\u000b k\f n−k . This is an equa- tion in the ring H\u0003—RPn−1 \u0002 RPn−1; Z2– ˇ Z2ƒ\u000b; \f⁄=—\u000b n;\f n– , so the coefﬁcient \u0010n k\u0011 must be zero in Z2 for all k in the range 0 <k<n . It is a rather easy number theory fact that this happens only when n is a power of 2 . Namely, an obviously equivalent statement is that in the polynomial ring Z2ƒx⁄ , the equality —1 ‡ x–n … 1 ‡ xn holds only when n is a power of 2 . To prove the latter statement, write n as a sum of powers of 2 , n … n1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001‡nk with n1 < \u0001\u0001\u0001 <nk . Then —1 ‡ x–n … —1 ‡ x– n1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 —1 ‡ x–nk … —1 ‡ xn1 – \u0001\u0001\u0001 —1 ‡ xnk – since squaring is an additive homomorphism with Z2 coefﬁ- cients. If one multiplies the product —1 ‡ xn1 – \u0001\u0001\u0001 —1 ‡ xnk – out, no terms combine or cancel since ni \u0015 2ni−1 for each i , and so the resulting polynomial has 2k terms. Thus if this polynomial equals 1 ‡ xn we must have k … 1 , which means that n is a power of 2 . tu It is sometimes important to have a relative version of the K¨unneth formula in Theorem 3.16. The relative cross product is H\u0003—X; A; R– ⊗R H\u0003—Y ; B; R– \u0002-----------------------!

The following commutative diagram shows that collapsing B to a point reduces the proof to the case that B is a point: B/BXA RH ()¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!, YBH (), AYH ( £XY£ XB£ £ £ ), \u0000¡¡¡¡¡! ¤¤ ¤ XA RH (), Y/B Y/BH (),\u0000 ¤¤ [ AH (( £X £ X £ )) Y/B() B/B(), ¤ [ ¼ ¼ The lower map is an isomorphism since the quotient spaces —X \u0002 Y –=—A\u0002 Y [ X \u0002 B– and ( X \u0002 —Y =B–\u0001 = ( A\u0002 —Y =B– [ X \u0002 —B=B–\u0001 are the same.

The lower row is the long exact sequence of a triple, and it too is a split short exact sequence since —X \u0002 y0;A\u0002 y0– is a retract of —X \u0002 Y; A\u0002 Y– . The middle and right cross product maps are isomorphisms by the case B …; since Hk—Y ; R– is a ﬁnitely generated free R module if Hk—Y ; y0; R– is. The ﬁve-lemma then implies that the left-hand cross product map is an isomorphism as well. tu The relative cross product for pairs —X; x0– and —Y ; y0– gives a reduced cross product eH\u0003—X; R– ⊗R eH\u0003—Y ; R– \u0002-----------------------! eH\u0003—X ^ Y ; R– where X ^Y is the smash product X \u0002 Y =—X \u0002fy0g[fx0g\u0002 Y– . The preceding theorem implies that this reduced cross product is an isomorphism if eH\u0003—X; R– or eH\u0003—Y ; R– is free and ﬁnitely generated in each dimension. For example, we have isomorphisms eHn—X; R– ˇ eHn‡k—X ^ S k; R– via cross product with a generator of Hk—S k; R– ˇ R . The space X ^ S k is the k fold reduced suspension Ö kX of X , so we see that the suspen- sion isomorphisms eHn—X; R– ˇ eHn‡k—Ö kX; R– derivable by elementary exact sequence arguments can also be obtained via cross product with a generator of eH\u0003—S k; R– . 224 Chapter 3 Cohomology Spaces with Polynomial Cohomology We saw in Theorem 3.12 that RP1 , CP1 , and HP1 have cohomology rings that are polynomial algebras. We will describe now a construction for enlarging S 2n to a space J—S 2n– whose cohomology ring H\u0003—J—S 2n–; Z– is almost the polynomial ring Zƒx⁄ on a generator x of dimension 2n . And if we change from Z to Q coefﬁcients, then H\u0003—J—S 2n–; Q– is exactly the polynomial ring Qƒx⁄ . This construction, known as the James reduced product, is also of interest because of its connections with loopspaces described in x4.J. For a space X , let Xk be the product of k copies of X . From the disjoint union ` k\u00151 Xk , let us form a quotient space J—X– by identifying —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xk– with —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bxi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xk– if xi … e , a chosen basepoint of X . Points of J—X– can thus be thought of as k tuples —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xk– , k \u0015 0 , with no xi … e . Inside J—X– is the subspace Jm—X– consisting of the points —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xk– with k \u0014 m . This can be viewed as a quotient space of Xm under the identiﬁcations —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xi;e; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xm– ˘ —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;e;xi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xm– . For example, J1—X– … X and J2—X– … X \u0002 X=—x; e– ˘ —e; x– . If X is a CW complex with e a0 cell, the quotient map Xm!Jm—X– glues together the m subcomplexes of the product complex Xm where one coordinate is e . These glueings are by homeomorphisms taking cells onto cells, so Jm—X– inherits a CW structure from Xm . There are natural inclusions Jm—X– ˆ Jm‡1—X– as subcomplexes, and J—X– is the union of these subcomplexes, hence is also a CW complex. Proposition 3.22. For n> 0 , H\u0003( J—S n–; Z \u0001 consists of a Z in each dimension a multiple of n .If n is even, the ith power of a generator of Hn( J—S n–; Z \u0001 is i! times a generator of Hin( J—S n–; Z \u0001 , for each i \u0015 1 . Thus for n even, H\u0003( J—S n–; Z \u0001 can be identiﬁed with the subring of the polyno- mial ring Qƒx⁄ additively generated by the monomials xi=i! . This subring is called a divided polynomial algebra and is denoted ÐZƒx⁄ . An exercise at the end of the section is to show that when n is odd, H\u0003( J—S n–; Z \u0001 is isomorphic as a graded ring to H\u0003—S n; Z– ⊗ H\u0003( J—S 2n–; Z \u0001 , the tensor product of an exterior algebra and a divided polynomial algebra. Proof: Giving S n its usual CW structure, the resulting CW structure on J—S n– con- sists of exactly one cell in each dimension a multiple of n . Thus if n> 1 we deduce immediately from cellular cohomology that H\u0003( J—S n–; Z \u0001 consists exactly of Z ’s in dimensions a multiple of n . An alternative argument that works also when n … 1 is the following. Consider the quotient map q : —S n– m!Jm—S n– . This carries each cell of —S n–m homeomorphically onto a cell of Jm—S n– . In particular q is a cellular map, taking k skeleton to k skeleton for each k ,so q induces a chain map of cellular chain complexes. This chain map is surjective since each cell of Jm—S n– is the homeo- morphic image of a cell of —S n–m . Hence all the cellular boundary maps for Jm—S n– Cup Product Section 3.2 225 will be trivial if the same is true for —S n–m , which it must be in order for H\u0003( —S n–m; Z \u0001 to have the structure given by Theorem 3.16. Since q maps each of the mn cells of —S n– m homeomorphically onto the n cell of Jm—S n– , we see from cellular cohomology that a generator \u000b 2 Hn( Jm—S n–; Z \u0001 pulls back by q\u0003 to the sum \u000b1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001‡\u000bm of the generators of Hn( —S n– m; Z \u0001 corresponding to the n cells of —S n– m .If n is even, the cup product structure in H\u0003( J—S n–; Z \u0001 is strictly commutative and H\u0003( —S n–m; Z \u0001 ˇ Zƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bm⁄=—\u000b 2 1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000b 2 m– . The power \u000bm then pulls back to —\u000b1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ \u000bm– m … m!\u000b1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u000bm , where the product \u000b1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u000bm generates Hmn( —S n– m; Z \u0001 ˇ Z . The map q is a homeomorphism from the mn cell of —S n– m to the mn cell of Jm—S n– ,so q\u0003 is an isomorphism on Hmn . This implies that \u000bm is m! times a generator of Hmn( Jm—S n–; Z \u0001 . Since the cells of J—S n–−Jm—S n– have dimension at least —m ‡ 1–n , the inclusion Jm—S n– ˆ J—S n– induces isomorphisms on Hi for i \u0014 mn . Thus if we let xi denote a generator of Hin( J—S n–; Z \u0001 , we have xm 1 …\u0006m!xm for all m . The sign can be made ‡ by rechoosing xm if need be. tu In ÐZƒx⁄ ˆ Qƒx⁄ ,ifwelet xi … xi=i! then the multiplicative structure is given by xixj … \u0010 i‡j i \u0011xi‡j . More generally, for a commutative ring R we could deﬁne ÐRƒx⁄ to be the free R module with basis x0 … 1;x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 and multiplication deﬁned by xixj … \u0010i‡j i \u0011xi‡j . The preceding proposition implies that H\u0003( J—S 2n–; R\u0001 ˇ ÐRƒx⁄ . When R … Q it is clear that ÐQƒx⁄ is just Qƒx⁄ . However, for R … Zp with p prime something quite different happens: There is an isomorphism ÐZp ƒx⁄ ˇ Zpƒx1;xp;xp2 ; \u0001\u0001\u0001⁄=—xp 1 ;xp p ;xp p2 ; \u0001\u0001\u0001– … O i\u00150 Zpƒxpi ⁄=—xp pi – as we show in x3.C, where we will also see that divided polynomial algebras are in a certain sense dual to polynomial algebras. The examples of projective spaces lead naturally to the following question: Given a coefﬁcient ring R and an integer d> 0 , is there a space X having H\u0003—X; R– ˇ Rƒ\u000b⁄ with j\u000bj… d ? Historically, it took major advances in the theory to answer this simple- looking question. Here is a table giving all the possible values of d for some of the most obvious and important choices of R , namely Z , Q , Z2 , and Zp with p an odd prime. As we have seen, projective R d Z 2; 4 Q any even number Z2 1; 2; 4 Zp any even divisor of 2—p − 1– spaces give the examples for Z and Z2 . Examples for Q are the spaces J—S d– , and examples for Zp are constructed in x3.G. Showing that no other d ’s are possible takes considerably more work. The fact that d must be even when R ﬂZ2 is a consequence of the commutativity property of cup product. In Theorem 4L.9 and Corollary 4L.10 we will settle the case R … Z and show that d must be a power of 2 for R … Z2 and a power of p times an even divisor of 2—p − 1– for R … Zp , p odd. Ruling out the remaining cases is best done using K–theory, as in [VBKT] or the classical reference 226 Chapter 3 Cohomology [Adams & Atiyah 1966]. However there is one slightly anomalous case, R … Z2 , d … 8, which must be treated by special arguments; see [Toda 1963]. It is an interesting fact that for each even d there exists a CW complex Xd which is simultaneously an example for all the admissible choices of coefﬁcients R in the table. Moreover, Xd can be chosen to have the simplest CW structure consistent with its cohomology, namely a single cell in each dimension a multiple of d . For example, we may take X2 … CP1 and X4 … HP1 . The next space X6 would have H\u0003—X6; Zp– ˇ Zpƒ\u000b⁄ for p … 7; 13; 19; 31; \u0001\u0001\u0001 , primes of the form 3s ‡ 1 , the condition 6j2—p − 1– being equivalent to p … 3s ‡ 1 . (By a famous theorem of Dirichlet there are inﬁnitely many primes in any such arithmetic progression.) Note that, in terms of Z coefﬁcients, Xd must have the property that for a generator \u000b of Hd—Xd; Z– , each power \u000b i is an integer ai times a generator of Hdi—Xd; Z– , with ai ﬂ 0if H\u0003—Xd; Q– ˇ Qƒ\u000b⁄ and ai relatively prime to p if H\u0003—Xd; Zp– ˇ Zpƒ\u000b⁄ . A construction of Xd is given in [SSAT], or in the original source [Hoffman & Porter 1973]. One might also ask about realizing the truncated polynomial ring Rƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b n‡1– , in view of the examples provided by RPn , CPn , and HPn , leaving aside the trivial case n … 1 where spheres provide examples. The analysis for polynomial rings also settles which truncated polynomial rings are realizable; there are just a few more than for the full polynomial rings. There is also the question of realizing polynomial rings Rƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn⁄ with gen- erators \u000bi in speciﬁed dimensions di . Since Rƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bm⁄ ⊗R Rƒ\f1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\fn⁄ is equal to Rƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bm;\f1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\fn⁄ , the product of two spaces with polynomial cohomology is again a space with polynomial cohomology, assuming the number of polynomial generators is ﬁnite in each dimension. For example, the n fold product —CP1–n has H\u0003( —CP1–n; Z \u0001 ˇ Zƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn⁄ with each \u000bi 2 dimensional. Similarly, products of the spaces J—S di – realize all choices of even di ’s with Q coefﬁcients. However, with Z and Zp coefﬁcients, products of one-variable examples do not exhaust all the possibilities. As we show in x4.D, there are three other basic examples with Z coefﬁcients: 1. Generalizing the space CP1 of complex lines through the origin in C 1 , there is the Grassmann manifold Gn—C 1– of n dimensional vector subspaces of C 1 , and this has H\u0003—Gn—C 1–; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn⁄ with j\u000bij… 2i . This space is also known as BU—n– , the ‘classifying space’ of the unitary group U—n– . It is central to the study of vector bundles and K–theory. 2. Replacing C by H , there is the quaternionic Grassmann manifold Gn—H 1– , also known as BSp—n– , the classifying space for the symplectic group Sp—n– , with H \u0003—Gn—H 1–; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn⁄ with j\u000bij… 4i . 3. There is a classifying space BSU—n– for the special unitary group SU—n– , whose cohomology is the same as for BU—n– but with the ﬁrst generator \u000b1 omitted, so H\u0003—BSU—n–; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn⁄ with j\u000bij… 2i . Cup Product Section 3.2 227 These examples and their products account for all the realizable polynomial cup prod- uct rings with Z coefﬁcients, according to a theorem in [Adams & Wilkerson 1980]. The situation for Zp coefﬁcients is more complicated and will be discussed in x3.G. Here is the evident general question along these lines: The Realization Problem. Which graded commutative R algebras occur as cup prod- uct algebras H\u0003—X; R– of spaces X ? This is a difﬁcult problem, with the degree of difﬁculty depending strongly on the coefﬁcient ring R . The most accessible case is R … Q , where essentially every graded commutative Q algebra is realizable, as shown in [Quillen 1969]. Next in order of difﬁculty is R … Zp with p prime. This is much harder than the case of Q , and only partial results, obtained with much labor, are known, mainly about realizing polynomial rings. Finally there is R … Z , about which very little is known beyond what is implied by the Zp cases. Polynomial algebras are examples of free graded commutative algebras, where ‘free’ means loosely ‘having no unnecessary relations.’ In general, a free graded com- mutative algebra is a tensor product of single-generator free graded commutative algebras. The latter are either polynomial algebras Rƒ\u000b⁄ on even-dimension gener- ators \u000b or quotients Rƒ\u000b⁄=—2\u000b 2– with \u000b odd-dimensional. Note that if R is a ﬁeld then Rƒ\u000b⁄=—2\u000b2– is either the exterior algebra ÓRƒ\u000b⁄ if the characteristic of R is not 2, or the polynomial algebra Rƒ\u000b⁄ otherwise. Every graded commutative algebra is a quotient of a free one, clearly. Example 3.23: Subcomplexes of the n Torus. To give just a small hint of the endless variety of nonfree cup product algebras that can be realized, consider subcomplexes of the n torus T n , the product of n copies of S 1 . Here we give S 1 its standard minimal cell structure and T n the resulting product cell structure. We know that H\u0003—T n; Z– is the exterior algebra ÓZƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn⁄ , with the monomial \u000bi1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u000bik corresponding via cellular cohomology to the k cell e1 i1 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 e1 ik . So if we pass to a subcomplex X ˆ T n by omitting certain cells, then H\u0003—X; Z– is the quotient of ÓZƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn⁄ obtained by setting the monomials corresponding to the omitted cells equal to zero. Since we are dealing with rings, we are factoring out by an ideal in ÓZƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn⁄ , the ideal generated by the monomials corresponding to the ‘minimal’ omitted cells, those whose boundary is entirely contained in X . For example, if we take X to be the subcomplex of T 3 obtained by deleting the cells e1 1 \u0002 e1 2 \u0002 e1 3 and e1 2 \u0002 e1 3 , then H\u0003—X; Z– ˇ ÓZƒ\u000b1;\u000b2;\u000b3⁄=—\u000b2\u000b3– . How many different subcomplexes of T n are there? To each subcomplex X ˆ T n we can associate a ﬁnite simplicial complex CX by the following procedure. View T n as the quotient of the n cube In … ƒ0; 1⁄ n ˆ R n obtained by identifying opposite faces. If we intersect In with the hyperplane x1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ xn … \" for small \"> 0, we get a simplex Ñn−1 . Then for q : In!T n the quotient map, we take CX to be 228 Chapter 3 Cohomology Ñ n−1 \\ q−1—X– . This is a subcomplex of Ñ n−1 whose k simplices correspond exactly to the —k ‡ 1– cells of X . Clearly X is uniquely determined by CX , and it is easy to see that every subcomplex of Ñn−1 occurs as CX for some subcomplex X of T n . Since every simplicial complex with n vertices is a subcomplex of Ñ n−1 , we see that T n has quite a large number of subcomplexes, if n is not too small. Of course, it may be that some of the resulting cohomology rings H\u0003—X; Z– are isomorphic for different subcomplexes X ˆ T n . For example, one could just permute the factors of T n to change X without affecting its cohomology ring. Whether there are less trivial examples is a harder algebraic problem. Somewhat more elaborate examples could be produced by looking at subcom- plexes of the product of n copies of CP1 . In this case the cohomology rings are isomorphic to polynomial rings modulo ideals generated by monomials. One could also take subcomplexes of a product of S 1 ’s and CP1 ’s. However, this is still a whole lot less complicated than the general case, where one takes free algebras modulo ide- als generated by arbitrary polynomials having all their terms of the same dimension. Let us conclude this section with an example of a cohomology ring that is not too far removed from a polynomial ring. Example 3.24: Cohen–Macaulay Rings. Let X be the quotient space CP1=CPn−1 . The quotient map CP1!X induces an injection H\u0003—X; Z–!H\u0003—CP1; Z– embedding H\u0003—X; Z– in Zƒ\u000b⁄ as the subring generated by 1;\u000b n;\u000b n‡1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 . If we view this sub- ring as a module over Zƒ\u000bn⁄ , it is free with basis f1;\u000b n‡1;\u000b n‡2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000b 2n−1g . Thus H\u0003—X; Z– is an example of a Cohen–Macaulay ring: a ring containing a polynomial sub- ring over which it is a ﬁnitely generated free module. While polynomial cup product rings are rather rare, Cohen–Macaulay cup product rings occur much more frequently. Exercises 1. Assuming as known the cup product structure on the torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 , compute the cup product structure in H\u0003—Mg– for Mg the closed orientable surface of genus g by using the quotient map from Mg to a wedge sum of g tori, shown below. 2. Using the cup product Hk—X; A; R–\u0002 H`—X; B; R–!Hk‡`—X; A [ B; R– , show that if X is the union of contractible open subsets A and B , then all cup products of positive-dimensional classes in H\u0003—X; R– are zero. This applies in particular if X is a suspension. Generalize to the situation that X is the union of n contractible open subsets, to show that all n fold cup products of positive-dimensional classes are zero. Cup Product Section 3.2 229 3.

(b) Prove the Borsuk–Ulam theorem by the following argument. Suppose on the con- trary that f : S n!R n satisﬁes f—x– ﬂ f—−x– for all x . Then deﬁne g : Sn!S n−1 by g—x– … ( f—x– − f—−x–\u0001 =jf—x– − f—−x–j ,so g—−x– …−g—x– and g induces a map RPn!RPn−1 . Show that part (a) applies to this map. 4. Apply the Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem to show that every map f : CPn!CPn has a ﬁxed point if n is even, using the fact that f \u0003 : H\u0003—CPn; Z–!H\u0003—CPn; Z– is a ring homomorphism. When n is odd show there is a ﬁxed point unless f \u0003—\u000b– …−\u000b , for \u000b a generator of H2—CPn; Z– . [See Exercise 3 in x2.C for an example of a map without ﬁxed points in this exceptional case.] 5.

Let X be CP2 with a cell e3 attached by a map S 2!CP1 ˆ CP2 of degree p , and let Y … M—Zp; 2– _ S 4 . Thus X and Y have the same 3 skeleton but differ in the way their 4 cells are attached. Show that X and Y have isomorphic cohomology rings with Z coefﬁcients but not with Zp coefﬁcients. 9. Show that if Hn—X; Z– is free for each n , then H\u0003—X; Zp– and H\u0003—X; Z– ⊗ Zp are isomorphic as rings, so in particular the ring structure with Z coefﬁcients determines the ring structure with Zp coefﬁcients. 10. Show that the cross product map H\u0003—X; Z– ⊗ H\u0003—Y ; Z–!H\u0003—X \u0002 Y ; Z– is not an isomorphism if X and Y are inﬁnite discrete sets. [This shows the necessity of the hypothesis of ﬁnite generation in Theorem 3.16.] 11.

Let q : RP1!CP1 be the natural quotient map obtained by regarding both spaces as quotients of S 1 , modulo multiplication by real scalars in one case and complex 230 Chapter 3 Cohomology scalars in the other. Show that the induced map q\u0003 : H\u0003—CP1; Z–!H\u0003—RP1; Z– is sur- jective in even dimensions by showing ﬁrst by a geometric argument that the restric- tion q : RP2!CP1 induces a surjection on H2 and then appealing to cup product struc- tures.

[Consider the natural quotient map S n \u0002 S n \u0002 J2k−1—S n–!J2k‡1—S n– and use induction on k .] 18. For the closed orientable surface M of genus g \u0015 1 , show that for each nonzero \u000b 2 H1—M; Z– there exists \f 2 H1—M; Z– with \u000b\f ﬂ 0 . Deduce that M is not homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum X _ Y of CW complexes with nontrivial reduced homology. Do the same for closed nonorientable surfaces using cohomology with Z2 coefﬁcients. Algebraic topology is most often concerned with properties of spaces that depend only on homotopy type, so local topological properties do not play much of a role. Digressing somewhat from this viewpoint, we study in this section a class of spaces whose most prominent feature is their local topology, namely manifolds, which are locally homeomorphic to R n . It is somewhat miraculous that just this local homo- geneity property, together with global compactness, is enough to impose a strong symmetry on the homology and cohomology groups of such spaces, as well as strong nontriviality of cup products. This is the Poincar´e duality theorem, one of the earliest theorems in the subject. In fact, Poincar´e’s original work on the duality property came before homology and cohomology had even been properly deﬁned, and it took many Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 231 years for the concepts of homology and cohomology to be reﬁned sufﬁciently to put Poincar´e duality on a ﬁrm footing. Let us begin with some deﬁnitions. A manifold of dimension n , or more concisely an n manifold, is a Hausdorff space M in which each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to R n . The dimension of M is intrinsically characterized by the fact that for x 2 M , the local homology group Hi—M; M −fxg; Z– is nonzero only for i … n : Hi—M; M −fxg; Z– ˇ Hi—R n; R n −f0g; Z– by excision ˇ eHi−1—R n −f0g; Z– since R n is contractible ˇ eHi−1—S n−1; Z– since R n −f0g' S n−1 A compact manifold is called closed, to distinguish it from the more general notion of a compact manifold with boundary, considered later in this section. For example S n is a closed manifold, as are RPn and lens spaces since they have S n as a covering space. Another closed manifold is CPn . This is compact since it is a quotient space of S 2n‡1 , and the manifold property is satisﬁed since there is an open cover by subsets homeomorphic to R 2n , the sets Ui …f ƒz0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn⁄ 2 CPn j zi … 1 g . The same reasoning applies also for quaternionic projective spaces. Further examples of closed manifolds can be generated from these using the obvious fact that the product of closed manifolds of dimensions m and n is a closed manifold of dimension m ‡ n . Poincar´e duality in its most primitive form asserts that for a closed orientable manifold M of dimension n , there are isomorphisms Hk—M; Z– ˇ Hn−k—M; Z– for all k . Implicit here is the convention that homology and cohomology groups of neg- ative dimension are zero, so the duality statement includes the fact that all the non- trivial homology and cohomology of M lies in the dimension range from 0 to n . The deﬁnition of ‘orientable’ will be given below. Without the orientability hypothesis there is a weaker statement that Hk—M; Z2– ˇ Hn−k—M; Z2– for all k . As we show in Corollaries A.8 and A.9 in the Appendix, the homology groups of a closed manifold are all ﬁnitely generated. So via the universal coefﬁcient theorem, Poincar´e duality for a closed orientable n manifold M can be stated just in terms of homology: Modulo their torsion subgroups, Hk—M; Z– and Hn−k—M; Z– are isomorphic, and the torsion subgroups of Hk—M; Z– and Hn−k−1—M; Z– are isomorphic. However, the statement in terms of cohomology is really more natural. Poincar´e duality thus expresses a certain symmetry in the homology of closed orientable manifolds. For example, consider the n dimensional torus T n , the product of n circles. By induction on n it follows from the K¨unneth formula, or from the easy special case Hi—X \u0002 S 1; Z– ˇ Hi—X; Z–\b Hi−1—X; Z– which was an exercise in x2.2, that Hk—T n; Z– is isomorphic to the direct sum of \u0010 n k\u0011 copies of Z . So Poincar´e duality is reﬂected in the relation \u0010n k\u0011 … \u0010 n n−k\u0011 . The reader might also check that Poincar´e duality is consistent with our calculations of the homology of projective spaces and lens spaces, which are all orientable except for RPn with n even. 232 Chapter 3 Cohomology For many manifolds there is a very nice geometric proof of Poincar´e duality using the notion of dual cell structures. The germ of this idea can be traced back to the ﬁve regular Platonic solids: the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. Each of these polyhedra has a dual polyhedron whose vertices are the center points of the faces of the given polyhedron. Thus the dual of the cube is the octahedron, and vice versa. Similarly the dodecahedron and icosahedron are dual to each other, and the tetrahedron is its own dual. One can regard each of these poly- hedra as deﬁning a cell structure C on S 2 with a dual cell structure C \u0003 determined by the dual polyhedron. Each vertex of C lies in a dual 2 cell of C \u0003 , each edge of C crosses a dual edge of C \u0003 , and each 2 cell of C contains a dual vertex of C \u0003 . The ﬁrst ﬁgure at the right shows the case of the cube and octahe- dron. There is no need to restrict to regular polyhedra here, and we can generalize further by replac- ing S 2 by any surface. A portion of a more-or-less random pair of dual cell structures is shown in the second ﬁgure. On the torus, if we lift a dual pair of cell structures to the universal cover R 2 , we get a dual pair of periodic tilings of the plane, as in the next three ﬁgures. The last two ﬁgures show that the standard CW structure on the sur- face of genus g , obtained from a 4g gon by identifying edges via the product of commutators ƒa1;b1⁄ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ƒag;bg⁄ , is homeomorphic to its own dual. Given a pair of dual cell structures C and C \u0003 on a closed surface M , the pair- ing of cells with dual cells gives identiﬁcations of cellular chain groups C \u0003 0 … C2 , C \u0003 1 … C1 , and C \u0003 2 … C0 . Ifweuse Z coefﬁcients these identiﬁcations are not quite canonical since there is an ambiguity of sign for each cell, the choice of a generator for the corresponding Z summand of the cellular chain complex. We can avoid this ambiguity by considering the simpler situation of Z2 coefﬁcients, where the identiﬁ- cations Ci … C \u0003 2−i are completely canonical. The key observation now is that under these identiﬁcations, the cellular boundary map @ : Ci!Ci−1 becomes the cellular coboundary map \u000e : C \u0003 2−i!C \u0003 2−i‡1 since @ assigns to a cell the sum of the cells which are faces of it, while \u000e assigns to a cell the sum of the cells of which it is a face. Thus Hi—C; Z2– ˇ H2−i—C \u0003; Z2– , and hence Hi—M; Z2– ˇ H2−i—M; Z2– since C and C \u0003 are cell structures on the same surface M . Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 233 To reﬁne this argument to Z coefﬁcients the problem of signs must be addressed. After analyzing the situation more closely, one sees that if M is orientable, it is pos- sible to make consistent choices of orientations of all the cells of C and C \u0003 so that the boundary maps in C agree with the coboundary maps in C \u0003 , and therefore one gets Hi—C; Z– ˇ H2−i—C \u0003; Z– , hence Hi—M; Z– ˇ H2−i—M; Z– . For manifolds of higher dimension the situation is entirely analogous. One would consider dual cell structures C and C \u0003 on a closed n manifold M , each i cell of C being dual to a unique —n−i– cell of C \u0003 which it intersects in one point ‘transversely.’ For example on the 3 dimensional torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 \u0002 S 1 one could take the standard cell structure lifting to the decomposition of the universal cover R 3 into cubes with vertices at the integer lattice points Z3 , and then the dual cell structure is obtained by translating this by the vector —1=2; 1=2; 1=2–. Each edge in either cell structure then has a dual 2 cell which it pierces orthogonally, and each vertex lies in a dual 3 cell. All the manifolds one commonly meets, for example all differentiable manifolds, have dually paired cell structures with the properties needed to carry out the proof of Poincar´e duality we have just sketched. However, to construct these cell structures requires a certain amount of manifold theory. To avoid this, and to get a theorem that applies to all manifolds, we will take a completely different approach, using algebraic topology to replace the geometry of dual cell structures. Orientations and Homology Let us consider the question of how one might deﬁne orientability for manifolds. First there is the local question: What is an orientation of R n ? Whatever an orientation of Rn is, it should have the property that it is preserved under rotations and reversed by reﬂections. For example, in R2 the notions of ‘clockwise’ and ‘counterclockwise’ certainly have this property, as do ‘right-handed’ and ‘left-handed’ in R 3 . We shall take the viewpoint that this property is what characterizes orientations, so anything satisfying the property can be regarded as an orientation. With this in mind, we propose the following as an algebraic-topological deﬁnition: An orientation of Rn at a point x is a choice of generator of the inﬁnite cyclic group Hn—R n; R n −fxg– , where the absence of a coefﬁcient group from the notation means that we take coefﬁcients in Z . To verify that the characteristic property of orienta- tions is satisﬁed we use the isomorphisms Hn—R n; R n −fxg– ˇ Hn−1—R n −fxg– ˇ Hn−1—S n−1– where S n−1 is a sphere centered at x . Since these isomorphisms are natural, and rotations of S n−1 have degree 1 , being homotopic to the identity, while reﬂections have degree −1 , we see that a rotation ˆ of Rn ﬁxing x takes a generator \u000b of Hn—Rn; R n −fxg– to itself, ˆ\u0003—\u000b– … \u000b , while a reﬂection takes \u000b to −\u000b . Note that with this deﬁnition, an orientation of R n at a point x determines an orientation at every other point y via the canonical isomorphisms Hn—R n; R n−fxg– ˇ Hn—R n; R n − B– ˇ Hn—R n; R n −fyg– where B is any ball containing both x and y . 234 Chapter 3 Cohomology An advantage of this deﬁnition of local orientation is that it can be applied to any n dimensional manifold M :A local orientation of M at a point x is a choice of generator \u0016x of the inﬁnite cyclic group Hn—M; M −fxg– . Notational Convention. In what follows we will very often be looking at homology groups of the form Hn—X; X − A– . To simplify notation we will write Hn—X; X − A– as Hn—X jj A– , or more generally Hn—X jj A; G– if a coefﬁcient group G needs to be speciﬁed. By excision, Hn—X jj A– depends only on a neighborhood of the closure of A in X , so it makes sense to view Hn—X jj A– as local homology of X at A . Having settled what local orientations at points of a manifold are, a global orien- tation ought to be ‘a consistent choice of local orientations at all points.’ We make this precise by the following deﬁnition. An orientation of an n dimensional manifold M is a function x , \u0016x assigning to each x 2 M a local orientation \u0016x 2 Hn—M jj x– , sat- isfying the ‘local consistency’ condition that each x 2 M has a neighborhood Rn ˆ M containing an open ball B of ﬁnite radius about x such that all the local orientations \u0016y at points y 2 B are the images of one generator \u0016B of Hn—M jj B– ˇ Hn—R n jj B– under the natural maps Hn—M jj B–!Hn—M jj y– . If an orientation exists for M , then M is called orientable. Every manifold M has an orientable two-sheeted covering space fM . For example, RP2 is covered by S 2 , and the Klein bottle has the torus as a two-sheeted covering space. The general construction goes as follows. As a set, let fM … \b \u0016x jjjj x 2 M and \u0016x is a local orientation of M at x } The map \u0016x , x deﬁnes a two-to-one surjection fM!M , and we wish to topologize fM to make this a covering space projection. Given an open ball B ˆ R n ˆ M of ﬁnite radius and a generator \u0016B 2 Hn—M jj B– , let U—\u0016B– be the set of all \u0016x 2 fM such that x 2 B and \u0016x is the image of \u0016B under the natural map Hn—M jj B–!Hn—M jj x– .It is easy to check that these sets U—\u0016B– form a basis for a topology on fM , and that the projection fM!M is a covering space. The manifold fM is orientable since each point \u0016x 2 fM has a canonical local orientation given by the element e\u0016x 2 Hn—fM jj \u0016x– cor- responding to \u0016x under the isomorphisms Hn—fM jj \u0016x– ˇ Hn—U—\u0016B– jj \u0016x– ˇ Hn—B jj x– , and by construction these local orientations satisfy the local consistency condition necessary to deﬁne a global orientation. Proposition 3.25. If M is connected, then M is orientable iff fM has two components. In particular, M is orientable if it is simply-connected, or more generally if ˇ1—M– has no subgroup of index two. The ﬁrst statement is a formulation of the intuitive notion of nonorientability as being able to go around some closed loop and come back with the opposite orientation, since in terms of the covering space fM!M this corresponds to a loop in M that lifts Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 235 to a path in fM connecting two distinct points with the same image in M . The existence of such paths is equivalent to fM being connected. Proof:If M is connected, fM has either one or two components since it is a two-sheeted covering space of M . If it has two components, they are each mapped homeomorphi- cally to M by the covering projection, so M is orientable, being homeomorphic to a component of the orientable manifold fM . Conversely, if M is orientable, it has exactly two orientations since it is connected, and each of these orientations deﬁnes a component of fM . The last statement of the proposition follows since connected two-sheeted covering spaces of M correspond to index-two subgroups of ˇ1—M– ,by the classiﬁcation of covering spaces. tu The covering space fM!M can be embedded in a larger covering space MZ!M where MZ consists of all elements \u000bx 2 Hn—M jj x– as x ranges over M . As before, we topologize MZ via the basis of sets U—\u000bB– consisting of \u000bx ’s with x 2 B and \u000bx the image of an element \u000bB 2 Hn—M jj B– under the map Hn—M jj B–!Hn—M jj x– . The covering space MZ!M is inﬁnite-sheeted since for ﬁxed x 2 M , the \u000bx ’s range over the inﬁnite cyclic group Hn—M jj x– . Restricting \u000bx to be zero, we get a copy M0 of M in MZ . The rest of MZ consists of an inﬁnite sequence of copies Mk of fM , k … 1; 2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 , where Mk consists of the \u000bx ’s that are k times either generator of Hn—M jj x– . A continuous map M!MZ of the form x , \u000bx 2 Hn—M jj x– is called a section of the covering space. An orientation of M is the same thing as a section x , \u0016x such that \u0016x is a generator of Hn—M jj x– for each x . One can generalize the deﬁnition of orientation by replacing the coefﬁcient group Z by any commutative ring R with identity. Then an R orientation of M assigns to each x 2 M a generator of Hn—M jj x; R– ˇ R , subject to the corresponding local consistency condition, where a ‘generator’ of R is an element u such that Ru … R . Since we assume R has an identity element, this is equivalent to saying that u is a unit, an invertible element of R . The deﬁnition of the covering space MZ generalizes immediately to a covering space MR!M , and an R orientation is a section of this covering space whose value at each x 2 M is a generator of Hn—M jj x; R– . The structure of MR is easy to describe. In view of the canonical isomorphism Hn—M jj x; R– ˇ Hn—M jj x– ⊗ R , each r 2 R determines a subcovering space Mr of MR consisting of the points \u0006\u0016x ⊗ r 2 Hn—M jj x; R– for \u0016x a generator of Hn—M jj x– .If r has order 2 in R then r …−r so Mr is just a copy of M , and otherwise Mr is isomorphic to the two-sheeted cover fM . The covering space MR is the union of these Mr ’s, which are disjoint except for the equality Mr … M−r . In particular we see that an orientable manifold is R orientable for all R , while a nonorientable manifold is R orientable iff R contains a unit of order 2 , which is equivalent to having 2 … 0in R . Thus every manifold is Z2 orientable. In practice this means that the two most important cases are R … Z and R … Z2 . In what follows 236 Chapter 3 Cohomology the reader should keep these two cases foremost in mind, but we will usually state results for a general R . The orientability of a closed manifold is reﬂected in the structure of its homology, according to the following result. Theorem 3.26. Let M be a closed connected n manifold. Then : (a) If M is R orientable, the map Hn—M; R–!Hn—M jj x; R– ˇ R is an isomorphism for all x 2 M . (b) If M is not R orientable, the map Hn—M; R–!Hn—M jj x; R– ˇ R is injective with image f r 2 R j 2r … 0 g for all x 2 M . (c) Hi—M; R– … 0 for i>n . In particular, Hn—M; Z– is Z or 0 depending on whether M is orientable or not, and in either case Hn—M; Z2– … Z2 . An element of Hn—M; R– whose image in Hn—M jj x; R– is a generator for all x is called a fundamental class for M with coefﬁcients in R . By the theorem, a fundamen- tal class exists if M is closed and R orientable. To show that the converse is also true, let \u0016 2 Hn—M; R– be a fundamental class and let \u0016x denote its image in Hn—M jj x; R– . The function x , \u0016x is then an R orientation since the map Hn—M; R–!Hn—M jj x; R– factors through Hn—M jj B; R– for B any open ball in M containing x . Furthermore, M must be compact since \u0016x can only be nonzero for x in the image of a cycle repre- senting \u0016 , and this image is compact. In view of these remarks a fundamental class could also be called an orientation class for M . The theorem will follow fairly easily from a more technical statement: Lemma 3.27. Let M be a manifold of dimension n and let A ˆ M be a compact subset. Then : (a) If x , \u000bx is a section of the covering space MR!M , then there is a unique class \u000bA 2 Hn—M jj A; R– whose image in Hn—M jj x; R– is \u000bx for all x 2 A . (b) Hi—M jj A; R– … 0 for i>n . To deduce the theorem from this, choose A … M , a compact set by assumption. Part (c) of the theorem is immediate from (b) of the lemma. To obtain (a) and (b) of the theorem, let ÐR—M– be the set of sections of MR!M . The sum of two sections is a section, and a scalar multiple of a section is a section, so ÐR—M– is an R module. There is a homomorphism Hn—M; R–!ÐR—M– sending a class \u000b to the section x , \u000bx , where \u000bx is the image of \u000b under the map Hn—M; R–!Hn—M jj x; R– . Part (a) of the lemma asserts that this homomorphism is an isomorphism. If M is connected, each section is uniquely determined by its value at one point, so statements (a) and (b) of the theorem are apparent from the earlier discussion of the structure of MR . tu Proof of 3.27: The coefﬁcient ring R will play no special role in the argument so we shall omit it from the notation. We break the proof up into four steps. Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 237 (1) First we observe that if the lemma is true for compact sets A , B , and A \\ B , then it is true for A [ B . To see this, consider the Mayer–Vietoris sequence 0 -! Hn—M jj A [ B– Ø-----! Hn—M jj A– \b Hn—M jj B– Ù-----! Hn—M jj A \\ B– Here the zero on the left comes from the assumption that Hn‡1—M jj A \\ B– … 0 . The map Ø is Ø—\u000b– … —\u000b; −\u000b– and Ù is Ù —\u000b; \f– … \u000b ‡ \f , where we omit notation for maps on homology induced by inclusion. The terms Hi—M jj A [ B– farther to the left in this sequence are sandwiched between groups that are zero by assumption, so Hi—M jj A [ B– … 0 for i>n . This gives (b). For the existence half of (a), if x , \u000bx is a section, the hypothesis gives unique classes \u000bA 2 Hn—M jj A– , \u000bB 2 Hn—M jj B– , and \u000bA\\B 2 Hn—M jj A \\ B– having image \u000bx for all x in A , B ,or A \\ B respectively. The images of \u000bA and \u000bB in Hn—M jj A \\ B– satisfy the deﬁning property of \u000bA\\B , hence must equal \u000bA\\B . Exactness of the sequence then implies that —\u000bA; −\u000bB– … Ø—\u000bA[B– for some \u000bA[B 2 Hn—M jj A [ B– . This means that \u000bA[B maps to \u000bA and \u000bB ,so \u000bA[B has image \u000bx for all x 2 A [ B since \u000bA and \u000bB have this property. To see that \u000bA[B is unique, observe that if a class \u000b 2 Hn—M jj A [ B– has image zero in Hn—M jj x– for all x 2 A [ B , then its images in Hn—M jj A– and Hn—M jj B– have the same property, hence are zero by hypothesis, so \u000b itself must be zero since Ø is injective. Uniqueness of \u000bA[B follows by applying this observation to the difference between two choices for \u000bA[B . (2) Next we reduce to the case M … R n . A compact set A ˆ M can be written as the union of ﬁnitely many compact sets A1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;Am each contained in an open R n ˆ M . We apply the result in (1) to A1 [ \u0001\u0001\u0001 [ Am−1 and Am . The intersection of these two sets is —A1 \\ Am– [\u0001\u0001\u0001 [ —Am−1 \\ Am– , a union of m − 1 compact sets each contained in an open Rn ˆ M . By induction on m this gives a reduction to the case m … 1. When m … 1 , excision allows us to replace M by the neighborhood R n ˆ M . (3) When M … Rn and A is a union of convex compact sets A1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;Am , an inductive argument as in (2) reduces to the case that A itself is convex. When A is convex the result is evident since the map Hi—R n jj A–!Hi—R n jj x– is an isomorphism for any x 2 A , as both Rn − A and R n −fxg deformation retract onto a sphere centered at x . (4) For an arbitrary compact set A ˆ R n let \u000b 2 Hi—Rn jj A– be represented by a relative cycle z , and let C ˆ Rn − A be the union of the images of the singular simplices in @z . Since C is compact, it has a positive distance \u000e from A . We can cover A by ﬁnitely many closed balls of radius less than \u000e centered at points of A . Let K be the union of these balls, so K is disjoint from C . The relative cycle z deﬁnes an element \u000bK 2 Hi—R n jj K– mapping to the given \u000b 2 Hi—R n jj A– .If i>n then by (3) we have Hi—Rn jj K– … 0, so \u000bK … 0 , which implies \u000b … 0 and hence Hi—R n jj A– … 0. If i … n and \u000bx is zero in Hn—R n jj x– for all x 2 A , then in fact this holds for all x 2 K , where \u000bx in this case means the image of \u000bK . This is because K is a union of balls B meeting A and Hn—Rn jj B–!Hn—R n jj x– is an isomorphism for all x 2 B . Since 238 Chapter 3 Cohomology \u000bx … 0 for all x 2 K , (3) then says that \u000bK is zero, hence also \u000b . This ﬁnishes the uniqueness statement in (a). The existence statement is easy since we can let \u000bA be the image of the element \u000bB associated to any ball B ˙ A . tu For a closed n manifold having the structure of a Ñ complex there is a more explicit construction for a fundamental class. Consider the case of Z coefﬁcients. In simplicial homology a fundamental class must be represented by some linear com- bination Pi ki˙i of the n simplices ˙i of M . The condition that the fundamental class maps to a generator of Hn—M jj x; Z– for points x in the interiors of the ˙i ’s means that each coefﬁcient ki must be \u00061 . The ki ’s must also be such that P i ki˙i is a cycle. This implies that if ˙i and ˙j share a common —n − 1– dimensional face, then ki determines kj and vice versa. Analyzing the situation more closely, one can show that a choice of signs for the ki ’s making P i ki˙i a cycle is possible iff M is orientable, and if such a choice is possible, then the cycle Pi ki˙i deﬁnes a funda- mental class. With Z2 coefﬁcients there is no issue of signs, and P i ˙i always deﬁnes a fundamental class. Some information about Hn−1—M– can also be squeezed out of the preceding theorem: Corollary 3.28. If M is a closed connected n manifold, the torsion subgroup of Hn−1—M; Z– is trivial if M is orientable and Z2 if M is nonorientable. Proof: This is an application of the universal coefﬁcient theorem for homology, using the fact that the homology groups of M are ﬁnitely generated, from Corollaries A.8 and A.9 in the Appendix. In the orientable case, if Hn−1—M; Z– contained torsion, then for some prime p , Hn—M; Zp– would be larger than the Zp coming from Hn—M; Z– . In the nonorientable case, Hn—M; Zm– is either Z2 or 0 depending on whether m is even or odd. This forces the torsion subgroup of Hn−1—M; Z– to be Z2 . tu The reader who is familiar with Bockstein homomorphisms, which are discussed in x3.E, will recognize that the Z2 in Hn−1—M; Z– in the nonorientable case is the im- age of the Bockstein homomorphism Hn—M; Z2–!Hn−1—M; Z– coming from the short exact sequence of coefﬁcient groups 0!Z!Z!Z2!0. The structure of Hn—M; G– and Hn−1—M; G– for a closed connected n manifold M can be explained very nicely in terms of cellular homology when M hasaCW structure with a single n cell, which is the case for a large number of manifolds. Note that there can be no cells of higher dimension since a cell of maximal dimension produces nontrivial local homology in that dimension. Consider the cellular boundary map d : Cn—M–!Cn−1—M– with Z coefﬁcients. Since M has a single n cell we have Cn—M– … Z .If M is orientable, d must be zero since Hn—M; Z– … Z . Then since d is zero, Hn−1—M; Z– must be free. On the other hand, if M is nonorientable then d Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 239 must take a generator of Cn—M– to twice a generator \u000b of a Z summand of Cn−1—M– , in order for Hn—M; Zp– to be zero for odd primes p and Z2 for p … 2 . The cellular chain \u000b must be a cycle since 2\u000b is a boundary and hence a cycle. It follows that the torsion subgroup of Hn−1—M; Z– must be a Z2 generated by \u000b . Concerning the homology of noncompact manifolds there is the following general statement. Proposition 3.29. If M is a connected noncompact n manifold, then Hi—M; R– … 0 for i \u0015 n . Proof: Represent an element of Hi—M; R– by a cycle z . This has compact image in M , so there is an open set U ˆ M containing the image of z and having compact closure U ˆ M . Let V … M − U . Part of the long exact sequence of the triple —M; U [ V; V– ﬁts into a commutative diagram MVURH () ¡¡¡!¡¡¡! M(¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! ;,, RH (); URH (); R); i 1 i i Hi + [ VVU [ , RH ();i VM ¼ When i>n , the two groups on either side of Hi—U [ V; V ; R– are zero by Lemma 3.27 since U [ V and V are the complements of compact sets in M . Hence Hi—U; R– … 0, so z is a boundary in U and therefore in M , and we conclude that Hi—M; R– … 0. When i … n , the class ƒz⁄ 2 Hn—M; R– deﬁnes a section x,ƒz⁄x of MR . Since M is connected, this section is determined by its value at a single point, so ƒz⁄x will be zero for all x if it is zero for some x , which it must be since z has compact image and M is noncompact. By Lemma 3.27, z then represents zero in Hn—M; V ; R– , hence also in Hn—U; R– since the ﬁrst term in the upper row of the diagram above is zero when i … n , by Lemma 3.27 again. So ƒz⁄ … 0in Hn—M; R– , and therefore Hn—M; R– … 0 since ƒz⁄ was an arbitrary element of this group. tu The Duality Theorem The form of Poincar´e duality we will prove asserts that for an R orientable closed n manifold, a certain naturally deﬁned map Hk—M; R–!Hn−k—M; R– is an isomor- phism. The deﬁnition of this map will be in terms of a more general construction called cap product, which has close connections with cup product. For an arbitrary space X and coefﬁcient ring R , deﬁne an R bilinear cap product a : Ck—X; R–\u0002 C `—X; R–!Ck−`—X; R– for k \u0015 ` by setting ˙ a ' … '( ˙ jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;v`⁄\u0001 ˙ jj ƒv`; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄ for ˙ : Ñk!X and ' 2 C `—X; R– . To see that this induces a cap product in homology 240 Chapter 3 Cohomology and cohomology we use the formula @—˙ a '– … —−1– `—@˙ a ' − ˙ a \u000e'– which is checked by a calculation: @˙ a ' … `X i … 0 —−1– i'( ˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;v`‡1⁄\u0001 ˙ jjƒv`‡1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄ ‡ kX i … `‡1 —−1– i'( ˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;v`⁄\u0001 ˙ jjƒv`; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄ ˙ a \u000e' … `‡1X i … 0 —−1– i'( ˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;v`‡1⁄\u0001 ˙ jjƒv`‡1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄ @—˙ a '– … kX i … `—−1– i−`'( ˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;v`⁄\u0001 ˙ jjƒv`; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvi; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄ From the relation @—˙ a '– …\u0006—@˙ a ' − ˙ a \u000e'– it follows that the cap product of a cycle ˙ and a cocycle ' is a cycle. Further, if @˙ … 0 then @—˙ a '– …\u0006—˙ a \u000e'– , so the cap product of a cycle and a coboundary is a boundary. And if \u000e' … 0 then @—˙ a '– …\u0006—@˙ a '– , so the cap product of a boundary and a cocycle is a boundary. These facts imply that there is an induced cap product Hk—X; R–\u0002 H`—X; R– a-----------------------! Hk−`—X; R– which is R linear in each variable. Using the same formulas, one checks that cap product has the relative forms Hk—X; A; R–\u0002 H`—X; R– a-----------------------! Hk−`—X; A; R– Hk—X; A; R–\u0002 H`—X; A; R– a-----------------------! Hk−`—X; R– For example, in the second case the cap product Ck—X; R–\u0002 C `—X; R–!Ck−`—X; R– restricts to zero on the submodule Ck—A; R–\u0002 C `—X; A; R– , so there is an induced cap product Ck—X; A; R–\u0002 C `—X; A; R–!Ck−`—X; R– . The formula for @—˙ a '– still holds, so we can pass to homology and cohomology groups. There is also a more general relative cap product Hk—X; A [ B; R–\u0002 H`—X; A; R– a-----------------------! Hk−`—X; B; R–; deﬁned when A and B are open sets in X , using the fact that Hk—X; A [ B; R– can be computed using the chain groups Cn—X; A ‡ B; R– … Cn—X; R–=Cn—A ‡ B; R– ,asinthe derivation of relative Mayer–Vietoris sequences in x2.2. Cap product satisﬁes a naturality property that is a little more awkward to state than the corresponding result for cup product since both covariant and contravariant functors are involved. Given a map f : X!Y , the relevant induced maps on homology and cohomology ﬁt into the diagram shown below. It does not quite make sense Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 241 to say this diagram commutes, but the spirit of commutativity is contained in the formula XH () XH ()k XH ()k£ ` `-¡¡¡! YH () YH ()k YH ()k£ ` `-¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¤f ¡¡¡¡¡! ¤f¡¡¡¡¡!¤f f\u0003—\u000b– a ' … f\u0003( \u000b a f \u0003—'–\u0001 which is obtained by substituting f˙ for ˙ in the deﬁnition of cap product: f˙ a' … '( f˙ jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;v`⁄\u0001 f˙ jj ƒv`; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄ . There are evident relative versions as well. Now we can state Poincar´e duality for closed manifolds: Theorem 3.30 (Poincar´e Duality). If M is a closed R orientable n manifold with fundamental class ƒM⁄ 2 Hn—M; R– , then the map D : Hk—M; R– -! Hn−k—M; R– de- ﬁned by D—\u000b– … ƒM⁄ a \u000b is an isomorphism for all k . Recall that a fundamental class for M is an element of Hn—M; R– whose image in Hn—M jj x; R– is a generator for each x 2 M . The existence of such a class was shown in Theorem 3.26. Example 3.31: Surfaces. Let M be the closed orientable surface of genus g , ob- tained as usual from a 4g gon by identifying pairs of edges according to the word a1b1a −1 1 b−1 1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 agbga −1 g b−1 g .A Ñ complex structure on M is obtained by coning off the 4g gon to its center, as indicated in the ﬁgure for the case g … 2 . We can compute cap products b b a a a a b b 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 ® 2® ¯ 2¯ + + ++ __ _ _ using simplicial homology and cohomology since cap products are deﬁned for simplicial homology and co- homology by exactly the same formula as for singular homology and cohomology, so the isomorphism be- tween the simplicial and singular theories respects cap products. A fundamental class ƒM⁄ generating H2—M– is represented by the 2 cycle formed by the sum of all 4g 2 simplices with the signs indicated. The edges ai and bi form a basis for H1—M– . Under the isomorphism H1—M– ˇ Hom—H1—M–; Z– , the cohomology class \u000bi corresponding to ai assigns the value 1 to ai and 0 to the other basis elements. This class \u000bi is represented by the cocycle 'i assigning the value 1 to the 1 simplices meeting the arc labeled \u000bi in the ﬁgure and 0 to the other 1 simplices. Similarly we have a class \fi corresponding to bi , represented by the cocycle i assigning the value 1 to the 1 simplices meeting the arc \fi and 0 to the other 1 simplices. Applying the deﬁnition of cap product, we have ƒM⁄ a 'i … bi and ƒM⁄ a i …−ai since in both cases there is just one 2 simplex ƒv0;v1;v2⁄ where 'i or i is nonzero on the edge ƒv0;v1⁄ . Thus bi is the Poincar´e dual of \u000bi and −ai is the Poincar´e dual of \fi .If we interpret Poincar´e duality entirely in terms of homology, identifying \u000bi with its Hom-dual ai and \fi with bi , then the classes ai and bi are Poincar´e duals of each other, up to sign at least. Geometrically, Poincar´e duality is reﬂected in the fact that the loops \u000bi and bi are homotopic, as are the loops \fi and ai . 242 Chapter 3 Cohomology The closed nonorientable surface N of genus g can be treated in the same way if we use Z2 coef- ﬁcients. We view N as obtained from a 2g gon by identifying consecutive pairs of edges according to the a a a a a a a a 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 4 ® 3® ® 4®word a 2 1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 a 2 g . We have classes \u000bi 2 H1—N; Z2– rep- resented by cocycles 'i assigning the value 1 to the edges meeting the arc \u000bi . Then ƒN⁄ a 'i … ai ,so ai is the Poincar´e dual of \u000bi . In terms of homology, ai is the Hom-dual of \u000bi ,so ai is its own Poincar´e dual. Geometrically, the loops ai on N are homotopic to their Poincar´e dual loops \u000bi . Our proof of Poincar´e duality, like the construction of fundamental classes, will be by an inductive argument using Mayer–Vietoris sequences. The induction step requires a version of Poincar´e duality for open subsets of M , which are noncompact and can satisfy Poincar´e duality only when a different kind of cohomology called cohomology with compact supports is used. Cohomology with Compact Supports Before giving the general deﬁnition, let us look at the conceptually simpler notion of simplicial cohomology with compact supports. Here one starts with a Ñ complex X which is locally compact. This is equivalent to saying that every point has a neigh- borhood that meets only ﬁnitely many simplices. Consider the subgroup Ñ i c—X; G– of the simplicial cochain group Ñi—X; G– consisting of cochains that are compactly supported in the sense that they take nonzero values on only ﬁnitely many sim- plices. The coboundary of such a cochain ' can have a nonzero value only on those —i‡1– simplices having a face on which ' is nonzero, and there are only ﬁnitely many such simplices by the local compactness assumption, so \u000e' lies in Ñ i‡1 c —X; G– . Thus we have a subcomplex of the simplicial cochain complex. The cohomology groups for this subcomplex will be denoted temporarily by Hi c—X; G– . Example 3.32. Let us compute these cohomology groups when X … R with the Ñ complex structure having vertices at the integer points. For a simplicial 0 cochain to be a cocycle it must take the same value on all vertices, but then if the cochain lies in Ñ0 c —X– it must be identically zero. Thus H0 c —R; G– … 0 . However, H1 c —R; G– is nonzero. Namely, consider the map Ö : Ñ 1 c —R; G–!G sending each cochain to the sum of its values on all the 1 simplices. Note that Ö is not deﬁned on all of Ñ 1—X– , just on Ñ1 c —X– . The map Ö vanishes on coboundaries, so it induces a map H1 c —R; G–!G . This is surjective since every element of Ñ1 c —X– is a cocycle. It is an easy exercise to verify that it is also injective, so H1 c —R; G– ˇ G . Compactly supported cellular cohomology for a locally compact CW complex could be deﬁned in a similar fashion, using cellular cochains that are nonzero on Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 243 only ﬁnitely many cells. However, what we really need is singular cohomology with compact supports for spaces without any simplicial or cellular structure. The quickest deﬁnition of this is the following. Let C i c—X; G– be the subgroup of C i—X; G– consisting of cochains ' : Ci—X–!G for which there exists a compact set K … K' ˆ X such that ' is zero on all chains in X − K . Note that \u000e' is then also zero on chains in X − K , so \u000e' lies in C i‡1 c —X; G– and the C i c—X; G– ’s for varying i form a subcomplex of the singular cochain complex of X . The cohomology groups Hi c—X; G– of this subcomplex are the cohomology groups with compact supports. Cochains in C i c—X; G– have compact support in only a rather weak sense. A stronger and perhaps more natural condition would have been to require cochains to be nonzero only on singular simplices contained in some compact set, depending on the cochain. However, cochains satisfying this condition do not in general form a subcomplex of the singular cochain complex. For example, if X … R and ' is a 0 cochain assigning a nonzero value to one point of R and zero to all other points, then \u000e' assigns a nonzero value to arbitrarily large 1 simplices. It will be quite useful to have an alternative deﬁnition of Hi c—X; G– in terms of alge- braic limits, which enter the picture in the following way. The cochain group C i c—X; G– is the union of its subgroups C i—X; X − K; G– as K ranges over compact subsets of X . Each inclusion K > L induces inclusions C i—X; X − K; G– > C i—X; X − L; G– for all i , so there are induced maps Hi—X; X − K; G–!Hi—X; X − L; G– . These need not be injective, but one might still hope that Hi c—X; G– is somehow describable in terms of the system of groups Hi—X; X − K; G– for varying K . This is indeed the case, and it is algebraic limits that provide the description. Suppose one has abelian groups G\u000b indexed by some partially ordered index set I having the property that for each pair \u000b; \f 2 I there exists γ 2 I with \u000b \u0014 γ and \f \u0014 γ . Such an I is called a directed set. Suppose also that for each pair \u000b \u0014 \f one has a homomorphism f\u000b\f : G\u000b!G\f , such that f\u000b\u000b … 11 for each \u000b , and if \u000b \u0014 \f \u0014 γ then f\u000bγ is the composition of f\u000b\f and f\fγ . Given this data, which is called a directed system of groups, there are two equivalent ways of deﬁning the direct limit group lim --!G\u000b . The shorter deﬁnition is that lim --!G\u000b is the quotient of the direct sum L \u000b G\u000b by the subgroup generated by all elements of the form a − f\u000b\f—a– for a 2 G\u000b , where we are viewing each G\u000b as a subgroup of L \u000b G\u000b . The other deﬁnition, which is often more convenient to work with, runs as follows. Deﬁne an equivalence relation on the set ` \u000b G\u000b by a ˘ b if f\u000bγ—a– … f\fγ—b– for some γ , where a 2 G\u000b and b 2 G\f . This is clearly reﬂexive and symmetric, and transitivity follows from the directed set property. It could also be described as the equivalence relation generated by setting a ˘ f\u000b\f—a– . Any two equivalence classes ƒa⁄ and ƒb⁄ have representatives a 0 and b0 lying in the same Gγ , so deﬁne ƒa⁄ ‡ ƒb⁄ … ƒa0 ‡ b0⁄ . One checks this is well- deﬁned and gives an abelian group structure to the set of equivalence classes. It is easy to check further that the map sending an equivalence class ƒa⁄ to the coset of a 244 Chapter 3 Cohomology in lim --!G\u000b is a homomorphism, with an inverse induced by the map P i ai , P iƒai⁄ for ai 2 G\u000bi . Thus we can identify lim --!G\u000b with the group of equivalence classes ƒa⁄ . A useful consequence of this is that if we have a subset J ˆ I with the property that for each \u000b 2 I there exists a \f 2 J with \u000b \u0014 \f , then lim --!G\u000b is the same whether we compute it with \u000b varying over I or just over J . In particular, if I has a maximal element γ , we can take J …fγg and then lim --!G\u000b … Gγ . Suppose now that we have a space X expressed as the union of a collection of subspaces X\u000b forming a directed set with respect to the inclusion relation. Then the groups Hi—X\u000b; G– for ﬁxed i and G form a directed system, using the homo- morphisms induced by inclusions. The natural maps Hi—X\u000b; G–!Hi—X; G– induce a homomorphism lim --!Hi—X\u000b; G–!Hi—X; G– . Proposition 3.33. If a space X is the union of a directed set of subspaces X\u000b with the property that each compact set in X is contained in some X\u000b , then the natural map lim --!Hi—X\u000b; G–!Hi—X; G– is an isomorphism for all i and G . Proof: For surjectivity, represent a cycle in X by a ﬁnite sum of singular simplices. The union of the images of these singular simplices is compact in X , hence lies in some X\u000b , so the map lim --!Hi—X\u000b; G–!Hi—X; G– is surjective. Injectivity is similar: If a cycle in some X\u000b is a boundary in X , compactness implies it is a boundary in some X\f ˙ X\u000b , hence represents zero in lim --!Hi—X\u000b; G– . tu Now we can give the alternative deﬁnition of cohomology with compact supports in terms of direct limits. For a space X , the compact subsets K ˆ X form a directed set under inclusion since the union of two compact sets is compact. To each compact K ˆ X we associate the group Hi—X; X − K; G– , with a ﬁxed i and coefﬁcient group G , and to each inclusion K ˆ L of compact sets we associate the natural homomorphism Hi—X; X −K; G–!Hi—X; X −L; G– . The resulting limit group lim --!Hi—X; X −K; G– is then equal to Hi c—X; G– since each element of this limit group is represented by a cocycle in C i—X; X − K; G– for some compact K , and such a cocycle is zero in lim --!Hi—X; X − K; G– iff it is the coboundary of a cochain in C i−1—X; X − L; G– for some compact L ˙ K . Note that if X is compact, then Hi c—X; G– … Hi—X; G– since there is a unique maximal compact set K ˆ X , namely X itself. This is also immediate from the original deﬁnition since C i c—X; G– … C i—X; G– if X is compact. Example 3.34: H\u0003 c —R n; G– . To compute lim --!Hi—R n; R n − K; G– it sufﬁces to let K range over balls Bk of integer radius k centered at the origin since every compact set is contained in such a ball. Since Hi—R n; R n − Bk; G– is nonzero only for i … n , when it is G , and the maps Hn—Rn; R n − Bk; G–!Hn—R n; R n − Bk‡1; G– are isomorphisms, we deduce that Hi c—R n; G– … 0 for i ﬂ n and Hn c —R n; G– ˇ G . This example shows that cohomology with compact supports is not an invariant of homotopy type. This can be traced to difﬁculties with induced maps. For example, Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 245 the constant map from R n to a point does not induce a map on cohomology with compact supports. The maps which do induce maps on H\u0003 c are the proper maps, those for which the inverse image of each compact set is compact. In the proof of Poincar´e duality, however, we will need induced maps of a different sort going in the opposite direction from what is usual for cohomology, maps Hi c—U; G–!Hi c—V ; G– associated to inclusions U > V of open sets in the ﬁxed manifold M . The group Hi—X; X−K; G– for K compact depends only on a neighborhood of K in X by excision, assuming X is Hausdorff so that K is closed. As convenient shorthand notation we will write this group as Hi—X jj K; G– , in analogy with the similar notation used earlier for local homology. One can think of cohomology with compact supports as the limit of these ‘local cohomology groups at compact subsets.’ Duality for Noncompact Manifolds For M an R orientable n manifold, possibly noncompact, we can deﬁne a dual- ity map DM : Hk c —M; R–!Hn−k—M; R– by a limiting process in the following way. For compact sets K ˆ L ˆ M we have a diagram ML RH ()n H (n £ k- ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¤i ¡¡¡¡¡! ¤i ;|| ML RH () k ;|| MK RH ()n £;|| MK RH () k ;|| MR); where Hn—M jj A; R– … Hn—M; M − A; R– and Hk—M jj A; R– … Hk—M; M − A; R– .By Lemma 3.27 there are unique elements \u0016K 2 Hn—M jj K; R– and \u0016L 2 Hn—M jj L; R– restricting to a given orientation of M at each point of K and L , respectively. From the uniqueness we have i\u0003—\u0016L– … \u0016K . The naturality of cap product implies that i\u0003—\u0016L–ax … \u0016Lai \u0003—x– for all x 2 Hk—M jj K; R– ,so \u0016K ax … \u0016Lai\u0003—x– . Therefore, let- ting K vary over compact sets in M , the homomorphisms Hk—M jj K; R–!Hn−k—M; R– , x,\u0016K ax , induce in the limit a duality homomorphism DM : Hk c —M; R–!Hn−k—M; R– . Since H\u0003 c —M; R– … H\u0003—M; R– if M is compact, the following theorem generalizes Poincar´e duality for closed manifolds: Theorem 3.35. The duality map DM : Hk c —M; R–!Hn−k—M; R– is an isomorphism for all k whenever M is an R oriented n manifold. The proof will not be difﬁcult once we establish a technical result stated in the next lemma, concerning the commutativity of a certain diagram. Commutativity state- ments of this sort are usually routine to prove, but this one seems to be an exception. The reader who consults other books for alternative expositions will ﬁnd somewhat uneven treatments of this technical point, and the proof we give is also not as simple as one would like. The coefﬁcient ring R will be ﬁxed throughout the proof, and for simplicity we will omit it from the notation for homology and cohomology. 246 Chapter 3 Cohomology Lemma 3.36. If M is the union of two open sets U and V , then there is a diagram of Mayer–Vietoris sequences, commutative up to sign : VUH () ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! c k +\\ \\ VUH ()c k 1 \\UH ()c k MH ()c kVH D U D V ()c k© © ......

The ﬁrst row of this limit diagram is exact since a direct limit of exact sequences is exact; this is an exercise at the end of the section, and follows easily from the deﬁnition of direct limits. It remains to consider the commutativity of the preceding diagram involving K and L . In the two squares shown, not involving boundary or coboundary maps, it is a triviality to check commutativity at the level of cycles and cocycles.

To evaluate the Mayer–Vietoris coboundary map \u000e on a cohomology class rep- resented by a cocycle ' 2 C \u0003—M; A \\ B– , the ﬁrst step is to write ' … 'A − 'B Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 247 for 'A 2 C \u0003—M; A– and 'B 2 C \u0003—M; B– . Then \u000eƒ'⁄ is represented by the cocy- cle \u000e'A … \u000e'B 2 C \u0003—M; A ‡ B– , where the equality \u000e'A … \u000e'B comes from the fact that ' is a cocycle, so \u000e' … \u000e'A − \u000e'B … 0 . Similarly, the boundary map @ in the homology Mayer–Vietoris sequence is obtained by representing an element of Hi—M– by a cycle z that is a sum of chains zU 2 Ci—U– and zV 2 Ci—V – , and then @ƒz⁄ … ƒ@zU ⁄ . Via barycentric subdivision, the class \u0016K[L can be represented by a chain \u000b that is a sum \u000bU −L ‡ \u000bU \\V ‡ \u000bV −K of chains in U − L , U \\ V , and V − K , respectively, since these three open K L U V ® ® ®U L V K U\\V _ _ sets cover M . The chain \u000bU \\V rep- resents \u0016K\\L since the other two chains \u000bU −L and \u000bV −K lie in the complement of K \\ L , hence van- ish in Hn—M jj K \\ L– ˇ Hn—U \\ V jj K \\ L– . Similarly, \u000bU −L ‡ \u000bU \\V represents \u0016K . In the square —\u0003– let ' be a cocycle representing an element of Hk—M jj K [ L– . Under \u000e this maps to the cohomology class of \u000e'A . Continuing on to Hn−k−1—U \\ V– we obtain \u000bU \\V a \u000e'A , which is in the same homology class as @\u000bU \\V a 'A since @—\u000bU \\V a 'A– … —−1– k—@\u000bU \\V a 'A − \u000bU \\V a \u000e'A– and \u000bU \\V a 'A is a chain in U \\ V . Going around the square —\u0003– the other way, ' maps ﬁrst to \u000b a ' . To apply the Mayer–Vietoris boundary map @ to this, we ﬁrst write \u000b a ' as a sum of a chain in U and a chain in V : \u000b a ' … —\u000bU −L a '– ‡ —\u000bU \\V a ' ‡ \u000bV −K a '– Then we take the boundary of the ﬁrst of these two chains, obtaining the homology class ƒ@—\u000bU −L a '–⁄ 2 Hn−k−1—U \\ V– . To compare this with ƒ@\u000bU \\V a 'A⁄ , we have @—\u000bU −L a '– … —−1–k@\u000bU −L a ' since \u000e' … 0 … —−1– k@\u000bU −L a 'A since @\u000bU −L a 'B … 0, 'B being zero on chains in B … M − L … —−1–k‡1@\u000bU \\V a 'A where this last equality comes from the fact that @—\u000bU −L ‡ \u000bU \\V – a 'A … 0 since @—\u000bU −L ‡ \u000bU \\V – is a chain in U − K by the earlier observation that \u000bU −L ‡ \u000bU \\V represents \u0016K , and 'A vanishes on chains in A … M − K . Thus the square —\u0003– commutes up to a sign depending only on k . tu Proof of Poincar´e Duality: There are two inductive steps, ﬁnite and inﬁnite: (A) If M is the union of open sets U and V and if DU , DV , and DU \\V are isomor- phisms, then so is DM . Via the ﬁve-lemma, this is immediate from the preceding lemma. 248 Chapter 3 Cohomology (B) If M is the union of a sequence of open sets U1 ˆ U2 ˆ\u0001\u0001\u0001 and each duality map DUi : Hk c —Ui–!Hn−k—Ui– is an isomorphism, then so is DM . To show this we notice ﬁrst that by excision, Hk c —Ui– can be regarded as the limit of the groups Hk—M jj K– as K ranges over compact subsets of Ui . Then there are natural maps Hk c —Ui–!Hk c —Ui‡1– since the second of these groups is a limit over a larger collection of K ’s. Thus we can form lim --!Hk c —Ui– which is obviously isomorphic to Hk c —M– since the compact sets in M are just the compact sets in all the Ui ’s. By Proposition 3.33, Hn−k—M– ˇ lim --!Hn−k—Ui– . The map DM is thus the limit of the isomorphisms DUi , hence is an isomorphism. Now after all these preliminaries we can prove the theorem in three easy steps: (1) The case M … Rn can be proved by regarding R n as the interior of Ñ n , and then the map DM can be identiﬁed with the map Hk—Ñ n;@Ñ n–!Hn−k—Ñ n– given by cap product with a unit times the generator ƒÑn⁄ 2 Hn—Ñ n;@Ñ n– deﬁned by the identity map of Ñn , which is a relative cycle. The only nontrivial value of k is k … n , when the cap product map is an isomorphism since a generator of Hn—Ñ n;@Ñ n– ˇ Hom—Hn—Ñ n;@Ñ n–; R– is represented by a cocycle ' taking the value 1 on Ñ n ,soby the deﬁnition of cap product, Ñn a' is the last vertex of Ñ n , representing a generator of H0—Ñ n– . (2) More generally, DM is an isomorphism for M an arbitrary open set in R n . To see this, ﬁrst write M as a countable union of nonempty bounded convex open sets Ui , for example open balls, and let Vi … S j<i Uj . Both Vi and Ui \\ Vi are unions of i − 1 bounded convex open sets, so by induction on the number of such sets in a cover we may assume that DVi and DUi\\Vi are isomorphisms. By (1), DUi is an isomorphism since Ui is homeomorphic to R n . Hence DUi[Vi is an isomorphism by (A). Since M is the increasing union of the Vi ’s and each DVi is an isomorphism, so is DM by (B). (3) If M is a ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite union of open sets Ui homeomorphic to R n , the theorem now follows by the argument in (2), with each appearance of the words ‘bounded convex open set’ replaced by ‘open set in Rn .’ Thus the proof is ﬁnished for closed manifolds, as well as for all the noncompact manifolds one ever encounters in actual practice. To handle a completely general noncompact manifold M we use a Zorn’s Lemma argument. Consider the collection of open sets U ˆ M for which the duality maps DU are isomorphisms. This collection is partially ordered by inclusion, and the union of every totally ordered subcollection is again in the collection by the argument in (B), which did not really use the hypothesis that the collection fUig was indexed by the positive integers. Zorn’s Lemma then implies that there exists a maximal open set U for which the theorem holds. If U ﬂ M , choose a point x 2 M − U and an open neighborhood V of x homeomorphic to Rn . The theorem holds for V and U \\ V by (1) and (2), and it holds for U by assumption, so by (A) it holds for U [V , contradicting the maximality of U . tu Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 249 Corollary 3.37. A closed manifold of odd dimension has Euler characteristic zero. Proof: Let M be a closed n manifold. If M is orientable, we have rank Hi—M; Z– … rank Hn−i—M; Z– , which equals rank Hn−i—M; Z– by the universal coefﬁcient theorem. Thus if n is odd, all the terms of Pi—−1– i rank Hi—M; Z– cancel in pairs. If M is not orientable we apply the same argument using Z2 coefﬁcients, with rank Hi—M; Z– replaced by dim Hi—M; Z2– , the dimension as a vector space over Z2 , to conclude that Pi—−1– i dim Hi—M; Z2– … 0 . It remains to check that this alternating sum equals the Euler characteristic P i—−1– i rank Hi—M; Z– . We can do this by using the isomorphisms Hi—M; Z2– ˇ Hi—M; Z2– and applying the universal coefﬁcient theo- rem for cohomology. Each Z summand of Hi—M; Z– gives a Z2 summand of Hi—M; Z2– . Each Zm summand of Hi—M; Z– with m even gives Z2 summands of Hi—M; Z2– and Hi‡1—M; Z2– , whose contributions to P i—−1– i dim Hi—M; Z2– cancel. And Zm sum- mands of Hi—M; Z– with m odd contribute nothing to H\u0003—M; Z2– . tu Connection with Cup Product Cup and cap product are related by the formula —\u0003– —\u000b a '– … —' ` –—\u000b– for \u000b 2 Ck‡`—X; R– , ' 2 C k—X; R– , and 2 C `—X; R– . This holds since for a singular —k ‡ `– simplex ˙ : Ñ k‡`!X we have —˙ a '– … ( '( ˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄\u0001 ˙ jjƒvk; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk‡`⁄\u0001 … '( ˙ jjƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk⁄\u0001 ( ˙ jjƒvk; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk‡`⁄\u0001 … —' ` –—˙ – The formula —\u0003– says that the map '` : C `—X; R–!C k‡`—X; R– is equal to the map HomR—C`—X; R–; R–!HomR—Ck‡`—X; R–; R– dual to a' . Passing to homology and co- homology, we obtain the commutative di- agram at the right. When the maps h are ¡¡¡! h (Hom;XRH ( R)` ;XRH ( () ), R )` ¡¡¡! h (Hom;XRH ( R ) k ` ;XRH (), R )¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!' ' ¤ + k `+ isomorphisms, for example when R is a ﬁeld or when R … Z and the homology groups of X are free, then the map ' ` is the dual of a ' . Thus in these cases cup and cap product determine each other, at least if one assumes ﬁnite generation so that cohomology determines homology as well as vice versa. However, there are examples where cap and cup products are not equivalent when R … Z and there is torsion in homology. By means of the formula —\u0003– , Poincar´e duality has nontrivial implications for the cup product structure of manifolds. For a closed R orientable n manifold M , consider the cup product pairing Hk—M; R– \u0002 Hn−k—M; R– ---------! R; —'; – , —' ` –ƒM⁄ 250 Chapter 3 Cohomology Such a bilinear pairing A\u0002 B!R is said to be nonsingular if the maps A!Hom—B; R– and B!Hom—A; R– , obtained by viewing the pairing as a function of each variable separately, are both isomorphisms. Proposition 3.38. The cup product pairing is nonsingular for closed R orientable manifolds when R is a ﬁeld, or when R … Z and torsion in H\u0003—M; Z– is factored out. Proof: Consider the composition Hn−k—M; R– h-----! HomR—Hn−k—M; R–; R– D\u0003 -----! HomR—Hk—M; R–; R– where h is the map appearing in the universal coefﬁcient theorem, induced by eval- uation of cochains on chains, and D\u0003 is the Hom dual of the Poincar´e duality map D : Hk!Hn−k . The composition D\u0003h sends 2 Hn−k—M; R– to the homomorphism ' , —ƒM⁄ a '– … —' ` –ƒM⁄ . For ﬁeld coefﬁcients or for integer coefﬁcients with torsion factored out, h is an isomorphism. Nonsingularity of the pairing in one of its variables is then equivalent to D being an isomorphism. Nonsingularity in the other variable follows by commutativity of cup product. tu Corollary 3.39. If M is a closed connected orientable n manifold, then for each element \u000b 2 Hk—M; Z– of inﬁnite order that is not a proper multiple of another element, there exists an element \f 2 Hn−k—M; Z– such that \u000b ` \f is a generator of Hn—M; Z– ˇ Z . With coefﬁcients in a ﬁeld the same conclusion holds for any \u000b ﬂ 0 . Proof: The hypotheses on \u000b mean that it generates a Z summand of Hk—M; Z– . There is then a homomorphism ' : Hk—M; Z–!Z with '—\u000b– … 1 . By the nonsingularity of the cup product pairing, ' is realized by taking cup product with an element \f 2 Hn−k—M; Z– and evaluating on ƒM⁄ ,so \u000b ` \f generates Hn—M; Z– . The case of ﬁeld coefﬁcients is similar. tu Example 3.40: Projective Spaces. The cup product structure of H\u0003—CPn; Z– as a truncated polynomial ring Zƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000bn‡1– with j\u000bj… 2 can easily be deduced from this as follows. The inclusion CPn−1>CPn induces an isomorphism on Hi for i \u0014 2n−2, so by induction on n , H2i—CPn; Z– is generated by \u000b i for i<n . By the corollary, there is an integer m such that the product \u000b ` m\u000b n−1 … m\u000bn generates H2n—CPn; Z– . This can only happen if m …\u00061 , and therefore H\u0003—CPn; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b n‡1– . The same argument shows H\u0003—HPn; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b n‡1– with j\u000bj… 4 . For RPn one can use the same argument with Z2 coefﬁcients to deduce that H\u0003—RPn; Z2– ˇ Z2ƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b n‡1– with j\u000bj… 1 . The cup product structure in inﬁnite-dimensional projective spaces follows from the ﬁnite-dimensional case, as we saw in the proof of Theorem 3.12. Could there be a closed manifold whose cohomology is additively isomorphic to that of CPn but with a different cup product structure? For n … 2 the answer is no since duality implies that the square of a generator of H2 must be a generator of Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 251 H4 . For n … 3 , duality says that the product of generators of H2 and H4 must be a generator of H6 , but nothing is said about the square of a generator of H2 . Indeed, for S 2 \u0002 S 4 , whose cohomology has the same additive structure as CP3 , the square of the generator of H2—S 2 \u0002 S 4; Z– is zero since it is the pullback of a generator of H2—S 2; Z– under the projection S 2 \u0002 S 4!S 2 , and in H\u0003—S 2; Z– the square of the generator of H2 is zero. More generally, an exercise for x4.D describes closed 6 manifolds having the same cohomology groups as CP3 but where the square of the generator of H2 is an arbitrary multiple of a generator of H4 . Example 3.41: Lens Spaces. Cup products in lens spaces can be computed in the same way as in projective spaces. For a lens space L 2n‡1 of dimension 2n ‡ 1 with funda- mental group Zm , we computed Hi—L2n‡1; Z– in Example 2.43 to be Z for i … 0 and 2n ‡ 1, Zm for odd i< 2n ‡ 1 , and 0 otherwise. In particular, this implies that L 2n‡1 is orientable, which can also be deduced from the fact that L 2n‡1 is the orbit space of an action of Zm on S 2n‡1 by orientation-preserving homeomorphisms, using an exer- cise at the end of this section. By the universal coefﬁcient theorem, Hi—L 2n‡1; Zm– is Zm for each i \u0014 2n‡1 . Let \u000b 2 H1—L 2n‡1; Zm– and \f 2 H2—L 2n‡1; Zm– be generators. The statement we wish to prove is: Hj—L 2n‡1; Zm– is generated by ( \f i for j … 2i \u000b\f i for j … 2i ‡ 1 By induction on n we may assume this holds for j \u0014 2n−1 since we have a lens space L2n−1 ˆ L 2n‡1 with this inclusion inducing an isomorphism on Hj for j \u0014 2n − 1, as one sees by comparing the cellular chain complexes for L 2n−1 and L 2n‡1 . The pre- ceding corollary does not apply directly for Zm coefﬁcients with arbitrary m , but its proof does since the maps h : Hi—L 2n‡1; Zm–!Hom—Hi—L 2n‡1; Zm–; Zm– are isomor- phisms. We conclude that \f ` k\u000b\f n−1 generates H2n‡1—L 2n‡1; Zm– for some integer k . We must have k relatively prime to m , otherwise the product \f ` k\u000b\f n−1 … k\u000b\f n would have order less than m and so could not generate H2n‡1—L2n‡1; Zm– . Then since k is relatively prime to m , \u000b\fn is also a generator of H2n‡1—L 2n‡1; Zm– . From this it follows that \fn must generate H2n—L 2n‡1; Zm– , otherwise it would have order less than m and so therefore would \u000b\fn . The rest of the cup product structure on H\u0003—L 2n‡1; Zm– is determined once \u000b 2 is expressed as a multiple of \f . When m is odd, the commutativity formula for cup product implies \u000b 2 … 0 . When m is even, commutativity implies only that \u000b 2 is either zero or the unique element of H2—L 2n‡1; Zm– ˇ Zm of order two. In fact it is the latter possibility which holds, since the 2 skeleton L2 is the circle L 1 with a 2 cell attached by a map of degree m , and we computed the cup product structure in this 2 complex in Example 3.9. It does not seem to be possible to deduce the nontriviality of \u000b2 from Poincar´e duality alone, except when m … 2. The cup product structure for an inﬁnite-dimensional lens space L 1 follows from the ﬁnite-dimensional case since the restriction map Hj—L 1; Zm–!Hj—L 2n‡1; Zm– is 252 Chapter 3 Cohomology an isomorphism for j \u0014 2n ‡ 1 . As with RPn , the ring structure in H\u0003—L 2n‡1; Z– is determined by the ring structure in H\u0003—L 2n‡1; Zm– , and likewise for L 1 , where one has the slightly simpler structure H\u0003—L 1; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b⁄=—m\u000b– with j\u000bj… 2 . The case of L2n‡1 is obtained from this by setting \u000b n‡1 … 0 and adjoining the extra Z ˇ H2n‡1—L 2n‡1; Z– . A different derivation of the cup product structure in lens spaces is given in Example 3E.2. Using the ad hoc notation Hk fr ee—M– for Hk—M– modulo its torsion subgroup, the preceding proposition implies that for a closed orientable manifold M of dimen- sion 2n , the middle-dimensional cup product pairing Hn fr ee—M–\u0002 Hn fr ee—M–!Z is a nonsingular bilinear form on Hn fr ee—M– . This form is symmetric or skew-symmetric according to whether n is even or odd. The algebra in the skew-symmetric case is rather simple: With a suitable choice of basis, the matrix of a skew-symmetric nonsin- gular bilinear form over Z can be put into the standard form consisting of 2\u0002 2 blocks ( 0 1 −1 0 \u0001 along the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, according to an algebra exercise at the end of the section. In particular, the rank of Hn—M 2n– must be even when n is odd. We are already familiar with these facts in the case n … 1 by the explicit computations of cup products for surfaces in x3.2. The symmetric case is much more interesting algebraically. There are only ﬁnitely many isomorphism classes of symmetric nonsingular bilinear forms over Z of a ﬁxed rank, but this ‘ﬁnitely many’ grows rather rapidly, for example it is more than 80 million for rank 32; see [Serre 1973] for an exposition of this beautiful chapter of number theory. It is known that for each even n \u0015 2 , every symmetric nonsingular form actually occurs as the cup product pairing in some closed manifold M 2n . One can even take M 2n to be simply-connected and have the bare minimum of homol- ogy: Z ’s in dimensions 0 and 2n and a Z k in dimension n . For n … 2 there are at most two nonhomeomorphic simply-connected closed 4 manifolds with the same bilinear form. Namely, there are two manifolds with the same form if the square \u000b ` \u000b of some \u000b 2 H2—M 4– is an odd multiple of a generator of H4—M 4– , for ex- ample for CP2 , and otherwise the M 4 is unique, for example for S 4 or S 2 \u0002 S 2 ; see [Freedman & Quinn 1990]. In x4.C we take the ﬁrst step in this direction by proving a classical result of J. H. C. Whitehead that the homotopy type of a simply-connected closed 4 manifold is uniquely determined by its cup product structure. Other Forms of Duality Generalizing the deﬁnition of a manifold, an n manifold with boundary is a Hausdorff space M in which each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic either to Rn or to the half-space R n ‡ …f —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn– 2 R n j xn \u0015 0 g . If a point x 2 M corresponds under such a homeomorphism to a point —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn– 2 R n ‡ with xn … 0 , then by excision we have Hn—M; M −fxg; Z– ˇ Hn—R n ‡; R n ‡ −f0g; Z– … 0, Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 253 whereas if x corresponds to a point —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn– 2 R n ‡ with xn > 0 or to a point of Rn , then Hn—M; M −fxg; Z– ˇ Hn—Rn; R n −f0g; Z– ˇ Z . Thus the points x with Hn—M; M −fxg; Z– … 0 form a well-deﬁned subspace, called the boundary of M and denoted @M . For example, @R n ‡ … R n−1 and @Dn … S n−1 . It is evident that @M is an —n − 1– dimensional manifold with empty boundary. If M is a manifold with boundary, then a collar neighborhood of @M in M is an open neighborhood homeomorphic to @M \u0002 ƒ0; 1– by a homeomorphism taking @M to @M \u0002f0g . Proposition 3.42. If M is a compact manifold with boundary, then @M has a collar neighborhood. Proof: Let M 0 be M with an external collar attached, the quotient of the disjoint union of M and @M \u0002 ƒ0; 1⁄ in which x 2 @M is identiﬁed with —x; 0– 2 @M \u0002 ƒ0; 1⁄ .It will sufﬁce to construct a homeomorphism h : M!M 0 since @M 0 clearly has a collar neighborhood. Since M is compact, so is the closed subspace @M . This implies that we can choose a ﬁnite number of continuous functions 'i : @M!ƒ0; 1⁄ such that the sets Vi … '−1 i —0; 1⁄ form an open cover of @M and each Vi has closure contained in an open set Ui ˆ M homeomorphic to the half-space R n ‡ . After dividing each 'i by Pj 'j we may assume P i 'i … 1. Let k … '1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ 'k and let Mk ˆ M 0 be the union of M with the points —x; t– 2 @M \u0002 ƒ0; 1⁄ with t \u0014 k—x– . By deﬁnition 0 … 0 and M0 … M . We construct a homeomorphism hk : Mk−1!Mk as follows. The homeomorphism Uk ˇ R n ‡ gives a collar neighborhood @Uk \u0002 ƒ−1; 0⁄ of @Uk in Uk , with x 2 @Uk corresponding to —x; 0– 2 @Uk \u0002 ƒ−1; 0⁄ . Via the external collar @M \u0002 ƒ0; 1⁄ we then have an embed- ding @Uk \u0002 ƒ−1; 1⁄ ˆ M 0 . We deﬁne hk to be the identity outside this @Uk \u0002 ƒ−1; 1⁄ , and for x 2 @Uk we let hk stretch the segment fxg\u0002 ƒ−1; k−1—x–⁄ linearly onto fxg\u0002 ƒ−1; k—x–⁄ . The composition of all the hk ’s then gives a homeomorphism M ˇ M 0 , ﬁnishing the proof. tu More generally, collars can be constructed for the boundaries of paracompact manifolds in the same way. A compact manifold M with boundary is deﬁned to be R orientable if M − @M is R orientable as a manifold without boundary. If @M \u0002 ƒ0; 1– is a collar neighborhood of @M in M then Hi—M; @M; R– is naturally isomorphic to Hi—M − @M; @M \u0002 —0;\"–; R– , so when M is R orientable, Lemma 3.27 gives a relative fundamental class ƒM⁄ in Hn—M; @M; R– restricting to a given orientation at each point of M − @M . It will not be difﬁcult to deduce the following generalization of Poincar´e duality to manifolds with boundary from the version we have already proved for noncompact manifolds: 254 Chapter 3 Cohomology Theorem 3.43. Suppose M is a compact R orientable n manifold whose boundary @M is decomposed as the union of two compact —n−1– dimensional manifolds A and B with a common boundary @A … @B … A \\ B . Then cap product with a fundamental class ƒM⁄ 2 Hn—M; @M; R– gives isomorphisms DM : Hk—M; A; R–!Hn−k—M; B; R– for all k . The possibility that A , B ,or A \\ B is empty is not excluded. The cases A …; and B …; are sometimes called Lefschetz duality. Proof: The cap product map DM : Hk—M; A; R–!Hn−k—M; B; R– is deﬁned since the existence of collar neighborhoods of A \\ B in A and B and @M in M implies that A and B are deformation retracts of open neighborhoods U and V in M such that U [ V deformation retracts onto A [ B … @M and U \\ V deformation retracts onto A \\ B . The case B …; is proved by applying Theorem 3.35 to M −@M . Via a collar neigh- borhood of @M we see that H k—M; @M; R– ˇ Hk c —M − @M; R– , and there are obvious isomorphisms Hn−k—M; R– ˇ Hn−k—M − @M; R– . The general case reduces to the case B …; by applying the ﬁve-lemma to the following diagram, where coefﬁcients in R are implicit: MAMH () ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! k + H () k 1 H () k MH ( k ......

We leave this as an exercise at the end of the section. tu Next we turn to Alexander duality: Theorem 3.44. If K is a compact, locally contractible, nonempty, proper subspace of S n , then eHi—S n − K; Z– ˇ eHn−i−1—K; Z– for all i . The special case that K is a sphere or disk was treated by more elementary means in Proposition 2B.1. As remarked there, it is interesting that the homology of S n − K does not depend on the way that K is embedded in S n . There can be local pathologies as in the case of the Alexander horned sphere, or global complications as with knotted circles in S 3 , but these have no effect on the homology of the complement. The only requirement is that K is not too bad a space itself. An example where the theorem fails without the local contractibility assumption is the ‘quasi-circle,’ deﬁned in an exercise for x1.3. This compact subspace K ˆ R 2 can be regarded as a subspace of Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 255 S 2 by adding a point at inﬁnity. Then we have eH0—S 2 − K; Z– ˇ Z since S 2 − K has two path-components, but eH1—K; Z– … 0 since K is simply-connected. Proof: We will obtain the desired isomorphism when i ﬂ 0 as the composition of ﬁve isomorphisms Hi—S n − K– ˇ Hn−i c —S n − K– ˇ lim --!Hn−i—S n − K; U − K– ˇ lim --!Hn−i—S n;U– ˇ lim --! eHn−i−1—U– if i ﬂ 0 ˇ eHn−i−1—K– where coefﬁcients in Z will be implicit throughout the proof, and the direct limits are taken with respect to open neighborhoods U of K . The ﬁrst isomorphism is Poincar´e duality. The second is the deﬁnition of cohomology with compact supports. The third is excision. The fourth comes from the long exact sequences of the pairs —S n;U– . For the ﬁnal isomorphism, an easy special case is when K has a neighborhood that is a mapping cylinder of some map X!K , as in the ‘letter examples’ at the beginning of Chapter 0, since in this case we can compute the direct limit using neighborhoods U which are segments of the mapping cylinder that deformation retract to K . To obtain the last isomorphism in the general case we need to quote Theorem A.7 in the Appendix, which says that K is a retract of some neighborhood U0 in S n since K is locally contractible. In computing the direct limits we can then restrict attention to open sets U ˆ U0 , which all retract to K by restricting the retraction of U0 . This implies that the natural restriction map lim --!H\u0003—U–!H\u0003—K– is surjective since we can pull back each element of H\u0003—K– to the direct limit via the retractions U!K . To see injectivity of the map lim --!H\u0003—U–!H\u0003—K– , we ﬁrst show that each neigh- borhood U ˆ U0 of K contains a neighborhood V such that the inclusion V > U is homotopic to the retraction V!K ˆ U . Namely, regarding U as a subspace of an Rn ˆ S n , the linear homotopy U \u0002 I!R n from the identity to the retraction U!K takes K \u0002 I to K , hence takes V \u0002 I to U for some neighborhood V of K , by compact- ness of I . Since the inclusion V > U is homotopic to the retraction V!K ˆ U , the restriction H\u0003—U–!H\u0003—V – factors through H\u0003—K– , and therefore if an element of H\u0003—U– restricts to zero in H\u0003—K– , it restricts to zero in H\u0003—V – . This implies that the map lim --!H\u0003—U–!H\u0003—K– is injective. The only difﬁculty in the case i … 0 is that the fourth of the ﬁve isomorphisms above does not hold, and instead we have only a short exact sequence 0 -! eHn−i−1—U– -! Hn−i—S n;U– -! eHn−i—S n– -! 0 To get around this little problem, observe that all the groups involved in the ﬁrst three of the ﬁve isomorphisms map naturally to the corresponding groups with K and U empty. Then if we take the kernels of these maps we get an isomorphism 256 Chapter 3 Cohomology eH0—S n − K– ˇ lim --! eHn—U– , and we have seen that the latter group is isomorphic to eHn—K– . tu Corollary 3.45. If X ˆ R n is compact and locally contractible then Hi—X; Z– is 0 for i \u0015 n and torsionfree for i … n − 1 and n − 2 . For example, a closed nonorientable n manifold M cannot be embedded as a sub- space of Rn‡1 since Hn−1—M; Z– contains a Z2 subgroup, by Corollary 3.28. Thus the Klein bottle cannot be embedded in R3 . More generally, the 2 dimensional complex Xm;n studied in Example 1.24, the quotient spaces of S 1 \u0002 I under the identiﬁcations —z; 0– ˘ —e2ˇ i=mz; 0– and —z; 1– ˘ —e2ˇ i=nz; 1– , cannot be embedded in R 3 if m and n are not relatively prime, since H1—Xm;nZ– is Z\u0002 Zd where d is the greatest common divisor of m and n . The Klein bottle is the case m … n … 2. Proof: Viewing X as a subspace of the one-point compactiﬁcation S n , Alexander duality gives isomorphisms eHi—X; Z– ˇ eHn−i−1—S n − X; Z– . The latter group is zero for i \u0015 n and torsionfree for i … n − 1 , so the result follows from the universal coefﬁcient theorem since X has ﬁnitely generated homology groups. tu Here is another kind of duality which generalizes the calculation of the local ho- mology groups Hi—R n; R n −fxg; Z– : Proposition 3.46. If K is a compact, locally contractible subspace of an orientable n manifold M , then there are isomorphisms Hi—M; M − K; Z– ˇ Hn−i—K; Z– for all i . Proof: Let U be an open neighborhood of K in M and let V be the complement of a compact set in M . We assume U \\ V …; . Then cap product with fundamental classes gives a commutative diagram with exact rows MH (iMH (iKMH ()i - KM )) -, MH ( n i VU ), UH (i KU )-,¼ ¼ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! - MH ( n i V ), -[ H ( n i VVU )), - H ( n i U -[... ... ... ... Passing to the direct limit over decreasing U ˙ K and V , the ﬁrst two vertical arrows become the Poincar´e duality isomorphisms Hi—M − K– ˇ Hn−i c —M − K– and Hi—M– ˇ Hn−i c —M– . The ﬁve-lemma then gives an isomorphism Hi—M; M − K– ˇ lim --!Hn−i—U– . The latter group will be isomorphic to Hn−i—K– by the argument in the proof of The- orem 3.44, provided that K is a retract of some neighborhood in M . To obtain such a retraction we can ﬁrst construct a map M > R k that is an embedding near the com- pact set K , for some large k , by the method of Corollary A.9 in the Appendix. Then a neighborhood of K in Rk retracts onto K by Theorem A.7 in the Appendix, so the restriction of this retraction to a neighborhood of K in M ﬁnishes the job. tu There is a way of extending Alexander duality and the duality in the preceding proposition to compact sets K that are not locally contractible, by replacing the sin- Poincar´e Duality Section 3.3 257 gular cohomology of K with another kind of cohomology called ˇCech cohomology. This is deﬁned in the following way. To each open cover U …fU\u000bg of a given space X we can associate a simplicial complex N—U– called the nerve of U . This has a vertex v\u000b for each U\u000b , and a set of k ‡ 1 vertices spans a k simplex whenever the k ‡ 1 corresponding U\u000b ’s have nonempty intersection. When another cover V …fV\fg is a reﬁnement of U , so each V\f is contained in some U\u000b , then these inclusions induce a simplicial map N—V–!N—U– that is well-deﬁned up to homotopy. We can then form the direct limit lim --!Hi—N—U–; G– with respect to ﬁner and ﬁner open covers U . This limit group is by deﬁnition the ˇCech cohomology group ˇHi—X; G– . For a full exposi- tion of this cohomology theory see [Eilenberg & Steenrod 1952]. With an analogous deﬁnition of relative groups, ˇCech cohomology turns out to satisfy the same axioms as singular cohomology, and indeed a stronger form of excision: a map —X; A–!—Y ; B– that restricts to a homeomorphism X − A!Y − B induces isomorphisms on ˇCech cohomology groups. For spaces homotopy equivalent to CW complexes, ˇCech coho- mology coincides with singular cohomology, but for spaces with local complexities it often behaves more reasonably. For example, if X is the subspace of R3 consisting of the spheres of radius 1=n and center —1=n; 0; 0– for n … 1; 2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 , then contrary to what one might expect, H3—X; Z– is nonzero, as shown in [Barratt & Milnor 1962]. But ˇH3—X; Z– … 0 and ˇH2—X; Z– … Z 1 , the direct sum of countably many copies of Z . Oddly enough, the corresponding ˇCech homology groups deﬁned using inverse limits are not so well-behaved. This is because the exactness axiom fails due to the algebraic fact that an inverse limit of exact sequences need not be exact, as a direct limit would be; see x3.F. However, there is a way around this problem using a more reﬁned deﬁnition. This is Steenrod homology theory, which the reader can ﬁnd out about in [Milnor 1995]. Exercises 1.

Universal Coefﬁcients for Homology Section 3.A 261 The main goal in this section is an algebraic formula for computing homology with arbitrary coefﬁcients in terms of homology with Z coefﬁcients. The theory parallels rather closely the universal coefﬁcient theorem for cohomology in x3.1. The ﬁrst step is to formulate the deﬁnition of homology with coefﬁcients in terms of tensor products. The chain group Cn—X; G– as deﬁned in x2.2 consists of the ﬁnite formal sums Pi gi˙i with gi 2 G and ˙i : Ñ n!X . This means that Cn—X; G– is a direct sum of copies of G , with one copy for each singular n simplex in X . More gen- erally, the relative chain group Cn—X; A; G– … Cn—X; G–=Cn—A; G– is also a direct sum of copies of G , one for each singular n simplex in X not contained in A . From the basic properties of tensor products listed in the discussion of the K¨unneth formula in x3.2 it follows that Cn—X; A; G– is naturally isomorphic to Cn—X; A– ⊗ G , via the correspondence Pi gi˙i , P i ˙i ⊗ gi . Under this isomorphism the boundary map Cn—X; A; G–!Cn−1—X; A; G– becomes the map @ ⊗ 11: Cn—X; A– ⊗ G!Cn−1—X; A– ⊗ G where @ : Cn—X; A–!Cn−1—X; A– is the usual boundary map for Z coefﬁcients. Thus we have the following algebraic problem: Given a chain complex \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Cn @n-----! Cn−1 -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 of free abelian groups Cn , is it possible to compute the homology groups Hn—C; G– of the associated chain complex \u0001\u0001\u0001 -----! Cn ⊗ G @n ⊗11----------------------------! Cn−1 ⊗ G -----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 just in terms of G and the homology groups Hn—C– of the original complex? To approach this problem, the idea will be to compare the chain complex C with two simpler subcomplexes, the subcomplexes consisting of the cycles and the boundaries in C , and see what happens upon tensoring all three complexes with G . Let Zn … Ker @n ˆ Cn and Bn … Im @n‡1 ˆ Cn . The restrictions of @n to these two subgroups are zero, so they can be regarded as subcomplexes Z and B of C with trivial boundary maps. Thus we have a short exact sequence of chain complexes consisting of the commutative diagrams (i) Cn B¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡!Z00n ¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! -Cn 1-Z00n 1 -B n 2 -n 1 -n 1 @ -n 1@ n@ n@ n@ The rows in this diagram split since each Bn is free, being a subgroup of the free group Cn . Thus Cn ˇ Zn \b Bn−1 , but the chain complex C is not the direct sum of the chain complexes Z and B since the latter have trivial boundary maps but the boundary maps in C may be nontrivial. Now tensor with G to get a commutative diagram 262 Chapter 3 Cohomology (ii) Cn B¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!ZG00n ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! -Cn 1-Z00n 1 -B n 2 -n 1 -n 1 @ -n 1@ n@ n@ n@ \u0000 G\u0000 G\u0000 G\u0000 G\u0000 \u0000 G\u0000 11 \u0000 11 \u0000 11 \u0000 11 \u0000 11 The rows are exact since the rows in (i) split and tensor products satisfy —A\b B– ⊗ G ˇ A ⊗ G \b B ⊗ G , so the rows in (ii) are split exact sequences too. Thus we have a short exact sequence of chain complexes 0!Z ⊗ G!C ⊗ G!B ⊗ G!0 . Since the boundary maps are trivial in Z ⊗ G and B ⊗ G , the associated long exact sequence of homology groups has the form —iii– \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Bn ⊗ G -! Zn ⊗ G -! Hn—C; G– -! Bn−1 ⊗ G -! Zn−1 ⊗ G -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 The ‘boundary’ maps Bn ⊗ G!Zn ⊗ G in this sequence are simply the maps in ⊗ 11 where in : Bn!Zn is the inclusion. This is evident from the deﬁnition of the boundary map in a long exact sequence of homology groups: In diagram (ii) one takes an element of Bn−1 ⊗ G , pulls it back via —@n ⊗ 11– −1 to Cn ⊗ G , then applies @n ⊗ 11 to get into Cn−1 ⊗ G , then pulls back to Zn−1 ⊗ G . The long exact sequence (iii) can be broken up into short exact sequences —iv– 0 -! Coker—in ⊗ 11– -! Hn—C; G– -! Ker—in−1 ⊗ 11– -! 0 where Coker—in ⊗ 11– … —Zn ⊗ G–= Im—in ⊗ 11– . The next lemma shows this cokernel is just Hn—C– ⊗ G . Lemma 3A.1. If the sequence of abelian groups A i-----! B j -----! C -----! 0 is exact, then so is A ⊗ G i⊗11------------------! B ⊗ G j⊗11 ------------------! C ⊗ G -----! 0 . Proof: Certainly the compositions of two successive maps in the latter sequence are zero. Also, j ⊗ 11 is clearly surjective since j is. To check exactness at B ⊗ G it sufﬁces to show that the map B ⊗ G= Im—i ⊗ 11–!C ⊗ G induced by j ⊗ 11 is an isomorphism, which we do by constructing its inverse. Deﬁne a map ' : C \u0002 G!B ⊗ G= Im—i ⊗ 11– by '—c; g– … b ⊗ g where j—b– … c . This ' is well-deﬁned since if j—b– … j—b0– … c then b − b … i—a– for some a 2 A by exactness, so b ⊗ g − b0 ⊗ g … —b − b0– ⊗ g … i—a– ⊗ g 2 Im—i ⊗ 11– . Since ' is a homomorphism in each variable separately, it induces a homomorphism C ⊗ G!B ⊗ G= Im—i ⊗ 11– . This is clearly an inverse to the map B ⊗ G= Im—i ⊗ 11–!C ⊗ G . tu It remains to understand Ker—in−1 ⊗ 11– , or equivalently Ker—in ⊗ 11– . The situation is that tensoring the short exact sequence —v– 0 --------! Bn in------------! Zn --------! Hn—C– --------! 0 with G produces a sequence which becomes exact only by insertion of the extra term Ker—in ⊗ 11– : —vi– 0 -! Ker—in ⊗ 11– -----! Bn ⊗ G in ⊗11-------------------------! Zn ⊗ G -----! Hn—C– ⊗ G -! 0 Universal Coefﬁcients for Homology Section 3.A 263 What we will show is that Ker—in ⊗ 11– does not really depend on Bn and Zn but only on their quotient Hn—C– , and of course G . The sequence (v) is a free resolution of Hn—C– , where as in x3.1 a free resolution of an abelian group H is an exact sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 -----! F2 f2------------! F1 f1------------! F0 f0------------! H -----! 0 with each Fn free. Tensoring a free resolution of this form with a ﬁxed group G produces a chain complex \u0001\u0001\u0001 -----! F1 ⊗ G f1 ⊗11 -------------------------! F0 ⊗ G f0 ⊗11 -------------------------! H ⊗ G -----! 0 By the preceding lemma this is exact at F0 ⊗ G and H ⊗ G , but to the left of these two terms it may not be exact. For the moment let us write Hn—F ⊗ G– for the homology group Ker—fn ⊗ 11–= Im—fn‡1 ⊗ 11– . Lemma 3A.2. For any two free resolutions F and F 0 of H there are canonical iso- morphisms Hn—F ⊗ G– ˇ Hn—F 0 ⊗ G– for all n . Proof: We will use Lemma 3.1(a). In the situation described there we have two free resolutions F and F 0 with a chain map between them. If we tensor the two free resolutions with G we obtain chain complexes F ⊗ G and F 0 ⊗ G with the maps \u000bn ⊗ 11 forming a chain map between them. Passing to homology, this chain map induces homomorphisms \u000b\u0003 : Hn—F ⊗ G–!Hn—F 0 ⊗ G– which are independent of the choice of \u000bn ’s since if \u000bn and \u000b 0 n are chain homotopic via a chain homotopy \u0015n then \u000bn ⊗ 11 and \u000b0 n ⊗ 11 are chain homotopic via \u0015n ⊗ 11. For a composition H \u000b-----! H0 \f -----! H00 with free resolutions F , F 0 , and F 00 of these three groups also given, the induced homomorphisms satisfy —\f\u000b–\u0003 … \f\u0003\u000b\u0003 since we can choose for the chain map F!F 00 the composition of chain maps F!F 0!F 00 . In particular, if we take \u000b to be an isomorphism, with \f its inverse and F 00 … F , then \f\u0003\u000b\u0003 … —\f\u000b–\u0003 … 11\u0003 … 11 , and similarly with \f and \u000b reversed. So \u000b\u0003 is an isomorphism if \u000b is an isomorphism. Specializing further, taking \u000b to be the identity but with two different free resolutions F and F 0 , we get a canonical isomorphism 11\u0003 : Hn—F ⊗ G–!Hn—F 0 ⊗ G– . tu The group Hn—F ⊗ G– , which depends only on H and G , is denoted Torn—H; G– . Since a free resolution 0!F1!F0!H!0 always exists, as noted in x3.1, it follows that Torn—H; G– … 0 for n> 1 . Usually Tor1—H; G– is written simply as Tor—H; G– .As we shall see later, Tor—H; G– provides a measure of the common torsion of H and G , hence the name ‘ Tor .’ Is there a group Tor0—H; G– ? With the deﬁnition given above it would be zero since Lemma 3A.1 implies that F1 ⊗ G!F0 ⊗ G!H ⊗ G!0 is exact. It is probably better to modify the deﬁnition of Hn—F ⊗ G– to be the homology groups of the sequence 264 Chapter 3 Cohomology \u0001\u0001\u0001 !F1 ⊗ G!F0 ⊗ G!0 , omitting the term H ⊗ G which can be regarded as a kind of augmentation. With this revised deﬁnition, Lemma 3A.1 then gives an isomorphism Tor0—H; G– ˇ H ⊗ G . We should remark that Tor—H; G– is a functor of both G and H : Homomorphisms \u000b : H!H0 and \f : G!G0 induce homomorphisms \u000b\u0003 : Tor—H; G–!Tor—H0;G– and \f\u0003 : Tor—H; G–!Tor—H; G0– , satisfying —\u000b\u000b 0–\u0003 … \u000b\u0003\u000b 0 \u0003 , —\f\f0–\u0003 … \f\u0003\f0 \u0003 , and 11\u0003 … 11. The induced map \u000b\u0003 was constructed in the proof of Lemma 3A.2, while for \f the construction of \f\u0003 is obvious. Before going into calculations of Tor—H; G– let us ﬁnish analyzing the earlier exact sequence (iv). Recall that we have a chain complex C of free abelian groups, with homology groups denoted Hn—C– , and tensoring C with G gives another complex C ⊗ G whose homology groups are denoted Hn—C; G– . The following result is known as the universal coefﬁcient theorem for homology since it describes homology with arbitrary coefﬁcients in terms of homology with the ‘universal’ coefﬁcient group Z . Theorem 3A.3. If C is a chain complex of free abelian groups, then there are natural short exact sequences 0 -! Hn—C– ⊗ G -! Hn—C; G– -! Tor—Hn−1—C–; G– -! 0 for all n and all G , and these sequences split, though not naturally. Naturality means that a chain map C!C 0 induces a map between the correspond- ing short exact sequences, with commuting squares. Proof: The exact sequence in question is (iv) since we have shown that we can identify Coker—in ⊗ 11– with Hn—C– ⊗ G and Ker in−1 with Tor—Hn−1—C–; G– . Verifying the nat- urality of this sequence is a mental exercise in deﬁnition-checking, left to the reader. The splitting is obtained as follows. We observed earlier that the short exact se- quence 0!Zn!Cn!Bn−1!0 splits, so there is a projection p : Cn!Zn restricting to the identity on Zn . The map p gives an extension of the quotient map Zn!Hn—C– to a homomorphism Cn!Hn—C– . Letting n vary, we then have a chain map C!H—C– where the groups Hn—C– are regarded as a chain complex with trivial boundary maps, so the chain map condition is automatic. Now tensor with G to get a chain map C ⊗ G!H—C– ⊗ G . Taking homology groups, we then have induced homomorphisms Hn—C; G–!Hn—C– ⊗ G since the boundary maps in the chain complex H—C– ⊗ G are trivial. The homomorphisms Hn—C; G–!Hn—C– ⊗ G give the desired splitting since at the level of chains they are the identity on cycles in C , by the deﬁnition of p . tu Corollary 3A.4. For each pair of spaces —X; A– there are split exact sequences 0 -! Hn—X; A– ⊗ G -! Hn—X; A; G– -! Tor—Hn−1—X; A–; G– -! 0 for all n , and these sequences are natural with respect to maps —X; A–!—Y ; B– . tu The splitting is not natural, for if it were, a map X!Y that induced trivial maps Hn—X–!Hn—Y – and Hn−1—X–!Hn−1—Y – would have to induce the trivial map Universal Coefﬁcients for Homology Section 3.A 265 Hn—X; G–!Hn—Y ; G– for all G , but in Example 2.51 we saw an instance where this fails, namely the quotient map M—Zm;n–!S n‡1 with G … Zm . The basic tools for computing Tor are given by: Proposition 3A.5. (1) Tor—A; B– ˇ Tor—B; A– . (2) Tor—LiAi;B– ˇ L iTor—Ai;B– . (3) Tor—A; B– … 0 if A or B is free, or more generally torsionfree. (4) Tor—A; B– ˇ Tor—T —A–; B– where T —A– is the torsion subgroup of A . (5) Tor—Zn;A– ˇ Ker—A n-----! A– . (6) For each short exact sequence 0!B!C!D!0 there is a naturally associated exact sequence 0!Tor—A; B–!Tor—A; C–!Tor—A; D–!A ⊗ B!A ⊗ C!A ⊗ D!0 Proof: Statement (2) is easy since one can choose as a free resolution of L i Ai the direct sum of free resolutions of the Ai ’s. Also easy is (5), which comes from tensoring the free resolution 0!Z n-----! Z!Zn!0 with A . For (3), if A is free, it has a free resolution with Fn … 0 for n \u0015 1 , so Tor—A; B– … 0 for all B . On the other hand, if B is free, then tensoring a free resolution of A with B preserves exactness, since tensoring a sequence with a direct sum of Z ’s produces just a direct sum of copies of the given sequence. So Tor—A; B– … 0 in this case too. The generalization to torsionfree A or B will be given below. For (6), choose a free resolution 0!F1!F0!A!0 and tensor with the given short exact sequence to get a commutative diagram¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!FB001 F1 F1¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! \u0000 C\u0000 D\u0000 ¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!FB00 0 F0 F0¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! \u0000 C\u0000 D\u0000 The rows are exact since tensoring with a free group preserves exactness. Extending the three columns by zeros above and below, we then have a short exact sequence of chain complexes whose associated long exact sequence of homology groups is the desired six-term exact sequence. To prove (1) we apply (6) to a free resolution 0!F1!F0!B!0 . Since Tor—A; F1– and Tor—A; F0– vanish by the part of (3) which we have proved, the six-term sequence in (6) reduces to the ﬁrst row of the following diagram:¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!A 0F1 AF0 A¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! \u0000\u0000 B\u0000 ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!FA 0 1 F 0 B¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! 0 ¡¡¡¡¡! 0 ¡¡¡¡¡! \u0000 A\u0000 A\u0000 BATor (), ABTor (), ¼¼ ¼ The second row comes from the deﬁnition of Tor—B; A– . The vertical isomorphisms come from the natural commutativity of tensor product. Since the squares commute, there is induced a map Tor—A; B–!Tor—B; A– , which is an isomorphism by the ﬁve- lemma. 266 Chapter 3 Cohomology Now we can prove the statement (3) in the torsionfree case. For a free resolution 0 -! F1 ' -----! F0 -! A -! 0 we wish to show that ' ⊗ 11: F1 ⊗ B!F0 ⊗ B is injective if B is torsionfree. Suppose Pi xi ⊗ bi lies in the kernel of ' ⊗ 11 . This means that Pi '—xi– ⊗ bi can be reduced to 0 by a ﬁnite number of applications of the deﬁning relations for tensor products. Only a ﬁnite number of elements of B are involved in this process. These lie in a ﬁnitely generated subgroup B0 ˆ B ,so P i xi ⊗ bi lies in the kernel of ' ⊗ 11: F1 ⊗ B0!F0 ⊗ B0 . This kernel is zero since Tor—A; B0– … 0, as B0 is ﬁnitely generated and torsionfree, hence free. Finally, we can obtain statement (4) by applying (6) to the short exact sequence 0!T —A–!A!A=T —A–!0 since A=T —A– is torsionfree. tu In particular, (5) gives Tor—Zm; Zn– ˇ Zq where q is the greatest common divisor of m and n . Thus Tor—Zm; Zn– is isomorphic to Zm ⊗ Zn , though somewhat by acci- dent. Combining this isomorphism with (2) and (3) we see that for ﬁnitely generated A and B , Tor—A; B– is isomorphic to the tensor product of the torsion subgroups of A and B , or roughly speaking, the common torsion of A and B . This is one reason for the ‘ Tor ’ designation, further justiﬁcation being (3) and (4). Homology calculations are often simpliﬁed by taking coefﬁcients in a ﬁeld, usually Q or Zp for p prime. In general this gives less information than taking Z coefﬁcients, but still some of the essential features are retained, as the following result indicates: Corollary 3A.6. (a) Hn—X; Q– ˇ Hn—X; Z– ⊗ Q , so when Hn—X; Z– is ﬁnitely gen- erated, the dimension of Hn—X; Q– as a vector space over Q equals the rank of Hn—X; Z– . (b) If Hn—X; Z– and Hn−1—X; Z– are ﬁnitely generated, then for p prime, Hn—X; Zp– consists of (i) a Zp summand for each Z summand of Hn—X; Z– , (ii) a Zp summand for each Zpk summand in Hn—X; Z– , k \u0015 1 , (iii) a Zp summand for each Zpk summand in Hn−1—X; Z– , k \u0015 1 . tu Even in the case of nonﬁnitely generated homology groups, ﬁeld coefﬁcients still give good qualitative information: Corollary 3A.7. (a) eHn—X; Z– … 0 for all n iff eHn—X; Q– … 0 and eHn—X; Zp– … 0 for all n and all primes p . (b) A map f : X!Y induces isomorphisms on homology with Z coefﬁcients iff it induces isomorphisms on homology with Q and Zp coefﬁcients for all primes p . Proof: Statement (b) follows from (a) by passing to the mapping cone of f . The universal coefﬁcient theorem gives the ‘only if’ half of (a). For the ‘if’ implication it sufﬁces to show that if an abelian group A is such that A ⊗ Q … 0 and Tor—A; Zp– … 0 Universal Coefﬁcients for Homology Section 3.A 267 for all primes p , then A … 0 . For the short exact sequences 0!Z p -----! Z!Zp!0 and 0!Z!Q!Q=Z!0 , the six-term exact sequences in (6) of the proposition become 0 -! Tor—A; Zp– -! A p -----! A -! A⊗ Zp -! 0 0 -! Tor—A; Q=Z– -! A -! A⊗ Q -! A⊗ Q=Z -! 0 If Tor—A; Zp– … 0 for all p , then exactness of the ﬁrst sequence implies that A p -----! A is injective for all p ,so A is torsionfree. Then Tor—A; Q=Z– … 0 by (3) or (4) of the proposition, so the second sequence implies that A!A ⊗ Q is injective, hence A … 0 if A ⊗ Q … 0. tu The algebra by means of which the Tor functor is derived from tensor products has a very natural generalization in which abelian groups are replaced by modules over a ﬁxed ring R with identity, using the deﬁnition of tensor product of R modules given in x3.2. Free resolutions of R modules are deﬁned in the same way as for abelian groups, using free R modules, which are direct sums of copies of R . Lemmas 3A.1 and 3A.2 carry over to this context without change, and so one has functors Tor R n—A; B– . However, it need not be true that TorR n—A; B– … 0 for n> 1 . The reason this was true when R … Z was that subgroups of free groups are free, but submodules of free R modules need not be free in general. If R is a principal ideal domain, submodules of free R modules are free, so in this case the rest of the algebra, in particular the universal coefﬁcient theorem, goes through without change. When R is a ﬁeld F , every module is free and Tor F n—A; B– … 0 for n> 0 via the free resolution 0!A!A!0. Thus Hn—C ⊗F G– ˇ Hn—C– ⊗F G if F is a ﬁeld. Exercises 1. Use the universal coefﬁcient theorem to show that if H\u0003—X; Z– is ﬁnitely generated, so the Euler characteristic ˜ —X– … P n—−1– n rank Hn—X; Z– is deﬁned, then for any coefﬁcient ﬁeld F we have ˜ —X– … P n—−1– n dim Hn—X; F– . 2. Show that Tor—A; Q=Z– is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup of A . Deduce that A is torsionfree iff Tor—A; B– … 0 for all B . 3. Show that if eHn—X; Q– and eHn—X; Zp– are zero for all n and all primes p , then eHn—X; Z– … 0 for all n , and hence eHn—X; G– … 0 for all G and n . 4. Show that ⊗ and Tor commute with direct limits: —lim --!A\u000b– ⊗ B … lim --!—A\u000b ⊗ B– and Tor—lim --!A\u000b;B– … lim --!Tor—A\u000b;B– . 5. From the fact that Tor—A; B– … 0if A is free, deduce that Tor—A; B– … 0if A is torsionfree by applying the previous problem to the directed system of ﬁnitely generated subgroups A\u000b of A . 6. Show that Tor—A; B– is always a torsion group, and that Tor—A; B– contains an element of order n iff both A and B contain elements of order n . 268 Chapter 3 Cohomology K¨unneth formulas describe the homology or cohomology of a product space in terms of the homology or cohomology of the factors. In nice cases these formulas take the form H\u0003—X \u0002 Y ; R– ˇ H\u0003—X; R– ⊗ H\u0003—Y ; R– or H\u0003—X \u0002 Y ; R– ˇ H\u0003—X; R– ⊗ H\u0003—Y ; R– for a coefﬁcient ring R . For the case of cohomology, such a formula was given in Theorem 3.16, with hypotheses of ﬁnite generation and freeness on the cohomology of one factor. To obtain a completely general formula without these hypotheses it turns out that homology is more natural than cohomology, and the main aim in this section is to derive the general K¨unneth formula for homology. The new feature of the general case is that an extra Tor term is needed to describe the full homology of a product. The Cross Product in Homology A major component of the K¨unneth formula is a cross product map Hi—X; R–\u0002 Hj—Y ; R– \u0002--------------------! Hi‡j—X \u0002 Y ; R– There are two ways to deﬁne this. One is a direct deﬁnition for singular homology, involving explicit simplicial formulas. More enlightening, however, is the deﬁnition in terms of cellular homology. This necessitates assuming X and Y are CW complexes, but this hypothesis can later be removed by the technique of CW approximation in x4.1. We shall focus therefore on the cellular deﬁnition, leaving the simplicial deﬁni- tion to later in this section for those who are curious to see how it goes. The key ingredient in the deﬁnition of the cellular cross product will be the fact that the cellular boundary map satisﬁes d—ei \u0002 ej– … dei \u0002 ej ‡ —−1–iei \u0002 dej . Implicit in the right side of this formula is the convention of treating the symbol \u0002 as a bilinear operation on cellular chains. With this convention we can then say more generally that d—a\u0002 b– … da\u0002 b ‡ —−1– ia\u0002 db whenever a is a cellular i chain and b is a cellular j chain. From this formula it is obvious that the cross product of two cycles is a cycle. Also, the product of a boundary and a cycle is a boundary since da\u0002 b … d—a\u0002 b– if db … 0 , and similarly a\u0002 db … —−1– id—a\u0002 b– if da … 0 . Hence there is an induced bilinear map Hi—X; R–\u0002 Hj—Y ; R–!Hi‡j—X \u0002 Y ; R– , which is by deﬁnition the cross product in cellular homology. Since it is bilinear, it could also be viewed as a homomorphism Hi—X; R– ⊗RHj—Y ; R–!Hi‡j—X \u0002 Y ; R– . In either form, this cross product turns out to be independent of the cell structures on X and Y . Our task then is to express the boundary maps in the cellular chain complex C\u0003—X \u0002 Y– for X \u0002 Y in terms of the boundary maps in the cellular chain complexes C\u0003—X– and C\u0003—Y – . For simplicity we consider homology with Z coefﬁcients here, but the same formula for arbitrary coefﬁcients follows immediately from this special case. With Z coefﬁcients, the cellular chain group Ci—X– is free with basis the i cells of X , but there is a sign ambiguity for the basis element corresponding to each cell ei , The General K¨unneth Formula Section 3.B 269 namely the choice of a generator for the Z summand of Hi—Xi;Xi−1– corresponding to ei . Only when i … 0 is this choice canonical. We refer to these choices as ‘choosing orientations for the cells.’ A choice of such orientations allows cellular i chains to be written unambiguously as linear combinations of i cells. The formula d—ei \u0002 ej– … dei \u0002 ej ‡—−1–iei \u0002 dej is not completely canonical since it contains the sign —−1– i but not —−1– j . Evidently there is some distinction being made between the two factors of ei \u0002 ej . Since the signs arise from orientations, we need to make explicit how an orientation of cells ei and ej determines an orientation of ei \u0002 ej . Via characteristic maps, orientations can be obtained from orientations of the domain disks of the characteristic maps. It will be convenient to choose these domains to be cubes since the product of two cubes is again a cube. Thus for a cell ei \u000b we take a characteristic map Ø\u000b : Ii!X where Ii is the product of i intervals ƒ0; 1⁄ . An orientation of Ii is a generator of Hi—Ii;@Ii– , and the image of this generator under Ø\u000b\u0003 gives an orientation of ei \u000b . We can identify Hi—Ii;@Ii– with Hi—Ii;Ii −fxg– for any point x in the interior of Ii , and then an orientation is determined by a linear embedding Ñi!Ii with x chosen in the interior of the image of this embedding. The embedding is determined by its sequence of vertices v0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi . The vectors v1 −v0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vi −v0 are linearly independent in Ii , thought of as the unit cube in R i ,so an orientation in our sense is equivalent to an orientation in the sense of linear algebra, that is, an equivalence class of ordered bases, two ordered bases being equivalent if they differ by a linear transformation of positive determinant. (An ordered basis can be continuously deformed to an orthonormal basis, by the Gram–Schmidt process, and two orthonormal bases are related either by a rotation or a rotation followed by a reﬂection, according to the sign of the determinant of the transformation taking one to the other.) With this in mind, we adopt the convention that an orientation of Ii \u0002 Ij … Ii‡j is obtained by choosing an ordered basis consisting of an ordered basis for Ii followed by an ordered basis for Ij . Notice that reversing the orientation for either Ii or Ij then reverses the orientation for Ii‡j , so all that really matters is the order of the two factors of Ii \u0002 Ij . Proposition 3B.1. The boundary map in the cellular chain complex C\u0003—X \u0002 Y– is determined by the boundary maps in the cellular chain complexes C\u0003—X– and C\u0003—Y – via the formula d—ei \u0002 ej– … dei \u0002 ej ‡ —−1– iei \u0002 dej . Proof: Let us ﬁrst consider the special case of the cube In . We give I the CW structure with two vertices and one edge, so the i th copy of I has a 1 cell ei and 0 cells 0i and 1i , with dei … 1i − 0i . The n cell in the product In is e1 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 en , and we claim that the boundary of this cell is given by the formula —\u0003– d—e1 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 en– … X i —−1– i‡1e1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 dei \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 en 270 Chapter 3 Cohomology This formula is correct modulo the signs of the individual terms e1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 0i \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 en and e1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 1i \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 en since these are exactly the —n − 1– cells in the boundary sphere @In of In . To obtain the signs in —\u0003– , note that switching the two ends of an I factor of In produces a reﬂection of @In , as does a transposition of two adjacent I factors. Since reﬂections have degree −1 , this implies that —\u0003– is correct up to an overall sign. This ﬁnal sign can be determined by looking at any term, say the term 01 \u0002 e2 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 en , which has a minus sign in —\u0003– . To check that this is right, consider the n simplex ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ with v0 at the origin and vk the unit vector along the k th coordinate axis for k> 0 . This simplex deﬁnes the ‘positive’ orientation of In as described earlier, and in the usual formula for its boundary the face ƒv0;v2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ , which deﬁnes the positive orientation for the face 01 \u0002 e2 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 en of In , has a minus sign. If we write In … Ii \u0002 Ij with i ‡ j … n and we set ei … e1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 ei and ej … ei‡1 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 en , then the formula —\u0003– becomes d—ei \u0002 ej– … dei \u0002 ej ‡ —−1– iei \u0002 dej . We will use naturality to reduce the general case of the boundary formula to this special case. When dealing with cellular homology, the maps f : X!Y that induce chain maps f\u0003 : C\u0003—X–!C\u0003—Y – of the cellular chain complexes are the cellular maps, taking Xn to Y n for all n , hence —Xn;Xn−1– to —Y n;Y n−1– . The naturality statement we want is then: Lemma 3B.2. For cellular maps f : X!Z and g : Y!W , the cellular chain maps f\u0003 : C\u0003—X–!C\u0003—Z– , g\u0003 : C\u0003—Y –!C\u0003—W – , and —f \u0002 g–\u0003 : C\u0003—X \u0002 Y–!C\u0003—Z \u0002 W– are related by the formula —f \u0002 g–\u0003 … f\u0003 \u0002 g\u0003 . Proof: The relation —f \u0002 g–\u0003 … f\u0003 \u0002 g\u0003 means that if f\u0003—ei \u000b– … P γ m\u000bγei γ and if g\u0003—ej \f– … P\u000e n\f\u000eej \u000e , then —f \u0002 g–\u0003—ei \u000b \u0002 ej \f– … Pγ\u000e m\u000bγn\f\u000e—ei γ \u0002 ej \u000e– . The coefﬁcient m\u000bγ is the degree of the composition f\u000bγ : S i!Xi=Xi−1!Z i=Z i−1!S i where the ﬁrst and third maps are induced by characteristic maps for the cells ei \u000b and ei γ , and the middle map is induced by the cellular map f . With the natural choices of basepoints in these quotient spaces, f\u000bγ is basepoint-preserving. The n\f\u000e ’s are obtained similarly from maps g\f\u000e : S j!S j . For f \u0002 g , the map —f \u0002 g–\u000b\f;γ\u000e : S i‡j!S i‡j whose degree is the coefﬁcient of ei γ \u0002 ej \u000e in —f \u0002 g–\u0003—ei \u000b \u0002 ej \f– is obtained from the product map f\u000bγ \u0002 g\f\u000e : S i \u0002 S j!S i \u0002 S j by collapsing the —i ‡ j − 1– skeleton of S i \u0002 S j to a point. In other words, —f \u0002 g–\u000b\f;γ\u000e is the smash product map f\u000bγ ^ g\f\u000e . What we need to show is the formula deg—f ^ g– … deg—f – deg—g– for basepoint-preserving maps f : S i!S i and g : S j!S j . Since f ^ g is the composition of f ^ 11 and 11 ^ g , it sufﬁces to show that deg—f ^11– … deg—f – and deg—11^g– … deg—g– . We do this by relating smash products to suspension. The smash product X ^S 1 can be viewed as X \u0002 I=—X \u0002 @I [fx0g\u0002 I– ,so it is the reduced suspension ÖX , the quotient of the ordinary suspension SX obtained by collapsing the segment fx0g\u0002 I to a point. If X is a CW complex with x0 a0 cell, The General K¨unneth Formula Section 3.B 271 the quotient map SX!X ^S 1 induces an isomorphism on homology since it collapses a contractible subcomplex to a point. Taking X … S i ,we have the commutative diagram at the right, and from the¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!SS Sfi() ¡¡¡¡!SS fi 1 SS i() ^ ^ SS i 1^ 11induced commutative diagram of homology groups Hi‡1 we deduce that Sf and f ^ 11 have the same degree. Since suspension preserves degree by Proposition 2.33, we conclude that deg—f ^ 11– … deg—f – . The 11 in this formula is the identity map on S 1 , and by iteration we obtain the same result for 11 the identity map on S j since S j is the smash product of j copies of S 1 . This implies also that deg—11 ^ g– … deg—g– since a permutation of coordinates in S i‡j does not affect the degree of maps S i‡j!S i‡j . tu Now to ﬁnish the proof of the proposition, let Ø : Ii!Xi and Ù : Ij!Y j be char- acteristic maps of cells ei \u000b ˆ X and ej \f ˆ Y . The restriction of Ø to @Ii is the at- taching map of ei \u000b . We may perform a preliminary homotopy of this attaching map @Ii!Xi−1 to make it cellular. There is no need to appeal to the cellular approxima- tion theorem to do this since a direct argument is easy: First deform the attaching map so that it sends all but one face of Ii to a point, which is possible since the union of these faces is contractible, then do a further deformation so that the image point of this union of faces is a 0 cell. A homotopy of the attaching map @Ii!Xi−1 does not affect the cellular boundary dei \u000b , since dei \u000b is determined by the induced map Hi−1—@Ii–!Hi−1—Xi−1–!Hi−1—Xi−1;Xi−2– . So we may assume Ø is cellular, and like- wise Ù , hence also Ø\u0002 Ù . The map of cellular chain complexes induced by a cellular map between CW complexes is a chain map, commuting with the cellular boundary maps. If ei is the i cell of Ii and ej the j cell of Ij , then Ø\u0003—ei– … ei \u000b , Ù\u0003—ej– … ej \f , and —Ø\u0002 Ù –\u0003—ei \u0002 ej– … ei \u000b \u0002 ej \f , hence d—ei \u000b \u0002 ej \f– … d ( —Ø\u0002 Ù –\u0003—ei \u0002 ej–\u0001 … —Ø\u0002 Ù –\u0003d—ei \u0002 ej– since —Ø\u0002 Ù –\u0003 is a chain map … —Ø\u0002 Ù –\u0003—dei \u0002 ej ‡ —−1–iei \u0002 dej– by the special case … Ø\u0003—dei–\u0002 Ù\u0003—ej– ‡ —−1–iØ\u0003—ei–\u0002 Ù\u0003—dej– by the lemma … dØ\u0003—ei–\u0002 Ù\u0003—ej– ‡ —−1–iØ\u0003—ei–\u0002 dÙ\u0003—ej– since Ø\u0003 and Ù\u0003 are chain maps … dei \u000b \u0002 ej \f ‡ —−1–iei \u000b \u0002 dej \f which completes the proof of the proposition. tu Example 3B.3. Consider X \u0002 S k where we give S k its usual CW structure with two cells. The boundary formula in C\u0003—X \u0002 S k– takes the form d—a\u0002 b– … da\u0002 b since d … 0in C\u0003—S k– . So the chain complex C\u0003—X \u0002 S k– is just the direct sum of two copies of the chain complex C\u0003—X– , one of the copies having its dimension shifted 272 Chapter 3 Cohomology upward by k . Hence Hn—X \u0002 S k; Z– ˇ Hn—X; Z–\b Hn−k—X; Z– for all n . In particular, we see that all the homology classes in X \u0002 S k are cross products of homology classes in X and S k . Example 3B.4. More subtle things can happen when X and Y both have torsion in their homology. To take the simplest case, let X be S1 with a cell e2 attached by a map S 1!S 1 of degree m ,so H1—X; Z– ˇ Zm and Hi—X; Z– … 0 for i> 1 . Similarly, let Y be obtained from S 1 by attaching a 2 cell by a map of degree n . Thus X and Y each have CW structures with three cells and so X \u0002 Y has nine cells. These are indicated by the dots in the diagram at the right, with X in the horizontal direction and Y in the vertical direction. The arrows denote the¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! m m m n e 2 e 1 e 0 e 0 e1 e2 nn- nonzero cellular boundary maps. For example the two arrows leaving the dot in the upper right corner indi- cate that @—e2 \u0002 e2– … m—e1 \u0002 e2– ‡ n—e2 \u0002 e1– . Obviously H1—X \u0002 Y ; Z– is Zm \b Zn . In dimension 2 , Ker @ is generated by e1 \u0002 e1 , and the image of the boundary map from dimension 3 consists of the multiples —`m − kn–—e1 \u0002 e1– . These form a cyclic group generated by q—e1 \u0002 e1– where q is the greatest common divisor of m and n ,so H2—X \u0002 Y ; Z– ˇ Zq . In dimension 3 the cycles are the multiples of —m=q–—e1 \u0002 e2– ‡ —n=q–—e2 \u0002 e1– , and the smallest such multiple that is a boundary is qƒ—m=q–—e1 \u0002 e2– ‡ —n=q–—e2 \u0002 e1–⁄ … m—e1 \u0002 e2– ‡ n—e2 \u0002 e1– ,so H3—X \u0002 Y ; Z– ˇ Zq . Since X and Y have no homology above dimension 1 , this 3 dimensional homol- ogy of X \u0002 Y cannot be realized by cross products. As the general theory will show, H2—X \u0002 Y ; Z– is H1—X; Z– ⊗ H1—Y ; Z– and H3—X \u0002 Y ; Z– is Tor—H1( X; Z–; H1—Y ; Z–\u0001 . This example generalizes easily to higher dimensions, with X … S i [ ei‡1 and Y … S j [ ej‡1 , the attaching maps having degrees m and n , respectively. Essentially the same calculation shows that X \u0002 Y has both Hi‡j and Hi‡j‡1 isomorphic to Zq . We should say a few words about why the cross product is independent of CW structures. For this we will need a fact proved in the next chapter in Theorem 4.8, that every map between CW complexes is homotopic to a cellular map. As we mentioned earlier, a cellular map induces a chain map between cellular chain complexes. It is easy to see from the equivalence between cellular and singular homology that the map on cellular homology induced by a cellular map is the same as the map induced on singular homology. Now suppose we have cellular maps f : X!Z and g : Y!W . Then Lemma 3B.2 implies that we have a commutative diagram¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! XHi (); ZHi (); Z Z YHj (); W Y WHj (); Z Z XHi j () () ; ZHi j (); Z Z ¤ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ + + f ¤g £f ¤g Now take Z and W to be the same spaces as X and Y but with different CW structures, and let f and g be cellular maps homotopic to the identity. The vertical maps in the The General K¨unneth Formula Section 3.B 273 diagram are then the identity, and commutativity of the diagram says that the cross products deﬁned using the different CW structures coincide. Cross product is obviously bilinear, or in other words, distributive. It is not hard to check that it is also associative. What about commutativity? If T : X \u0002 Y!Y \u0002 X is transposition of the factors, then we can ask whether T\u0003—a\u0002 b– equals b\u0002 a . The only effect transposing the factors has on the deﬁnition of cross product is in the convention for orienting a product Ii \u0002 Ij by taking an ordered basis in the ﬁrst factor followed by an ordered basis in the second factor. Switching the two factors can be achieved by moving each of the i coordinates of Ii past each of the coordinates of Ij . This is a total of ij transpositions of adjacent coordinates, each realizable by a reﬂection, so a sign of —−1– ij is introduced. Thus the correct formula is T\u0003—a\u0002 b– … —−1–ijb\u0002 a for a 2 Hi—X– and b 2 Hj—Y – . The Algebraic K¨unneth Formula By adding together the various cross products we obtain a map L i( Hi—X; Z– ⊗ Hn−i—Y ; Z–\u0001 ---------! Hn—X \u0002 Y ; Z– and it is natural to ask whether this is an isomorphism. Example 3B.4 above shows that this is not always the case, though it is true in Example 3B.3. Our main goal in what follows is to show that the map is always injective, and that its cokernel is LiTor( Hi—X; Z–; Hn−i−1—Y ; Z–\u0001 . More generally, we consider other coefﬁcients besides Z and show in particular that with ﬁeld coefﬁcients the map is an isomorphism. For CW complexes X and Y , the relationship between the cellular chain com- plexes C\u0003—X– , C\u0003—Y – , and C\u0003—X \u0002 Y– can be expressed nicely in terms of tensor prod- ucts. Since the n cells of X \u0002 Y are the products of i cells of X with —n − i– cells of Y , we have Cn—X \u0002 Y– ˇ L i( Ci—X– ⊗ Cn−i—Y – \u0001 , with ei \u0002 ej corresponding to ei ⊗ ej . Un- der this identiﬁcation the boundary formula of Proposition 3B.1 becomes d—ei ⊗ ej– … dei ⊗ ej ‡ —−1– iei ⊗ dej . Our task now is purely algebraic, to compute the homology of the chain complex C\u0003—X \u0002 Y– from the homology of C\u0003—X– and C\u0003—Y – . Suppose we are given chain complexes C and C 0 of abelian groups Cn and C 0 n , or more generally R modules over a commutative ring R . The tensor product chain complex C ⊗RC 0 is then deﬁned by —C ⊗RC 0–n … L i—Ci ⊗RC 0 n−i– , with boundary maps given by @—c ⊗ c0– … @c ⊗ c0 ‡ —−1–ic ⊗ @c0 for c 2 Ci and c0 2 C 0 n−i . The sign —−1– i guarantees that @2 … 0in C ⊗RC 0 , since @2—c ⊗ c0– … @( @c ⊗ c0 ‡ —−1–ic ⊗ @c0\u0001 … @2c ⊗ c0 ‡ —−1–i−1@c ⊗ @c0 ‡ —−1–i@c ⊗ @c0 ‡ c ⊗ @2c0 … 0 From the boundary formula @—c ⊗ c0– … @c ⊗ c0 ‡ —−1–ic ⊗ @c0 it follows that the tensor product of cycles is a cycle, and the tensor product of a cycle and a boundary, in either order, is a boundary, just as for the cross product deﬁned earlier. So there is induced a natural map on homology groups Hi—C– ⊗RHn−i—C 0–!Hn—C ⊗RC 0– . Summing over i 274 Chapter 3 Cohomology then gives a map L i( Hi—C– ⊗RHn−i—C 0–\u0001!Hn—C ⊗RC 0– . This ﬁgures in the following algebraic version of the K¨unneth formula: Theorem 3B.5. If R is a principal ideal domain and the R modules Ci are free, then for each n there is a natural short exact sequence 0!L i( Hi—C– ⊗R Hn−i—C 0–\u0001 !Hn—C ⊗R C 0–!L i( TorR—Hi—C–; Hn−i−1—C 0–\u0001 !0 and this sequence splits. This is a generalization of the universal coefﬁcient theorem for homology, which is the case that C 0 consists of just the coefﬁcient group G in dimension zero. The proof will also be a natural generalization of the proof of the universal coefﬁcient theorem. Proof: First we do the special case that the boundary maps in C are all zero, so Hi—C– … Ci . In this case @—c ⊗ c0– … —−1– ic ⊗ @c0 and the chain complex C ⊗RC 0 is simply the direct sum of the complexes Ci ⊗RC 0 , each of which is a direct sum of copies of C 0 since Ci is free. Hence Hn—Ci ⊗RC 0– ˇ Ci ⊗RHn−i—C 0– … Hi—C– ⊗RHn−i—C 0– . Summing over i yields an isomorphism Hn—C ⊗RC 0– ˇ L i( Hi—C– ⊗RHn−i—C 0–\u0001 , which is the statement of the theorem since there are no Tor terms, Hi—C– … Ci being free. In the general case, let Zi ˆ Ci and Bi ˆ Ci denote kernel and image of the boundary homomorphisms for C . These give subchain complexes Z and B of C with trivial boundary maps. We have a short exact sequence of chain complexes 0!Z!C!B!0 made up of the short exact sequences 0!Zi!Ci @-----! Bi−1!0 each of which splits since Bi−1 is free, being a submodule of Ci−1 which is free by assumption. Because of the splitting, when we tensor 0!Z!C!B!0 with C 0 we obtain another short exact sequence of chain complexes, and hence a long exact sequence in homology \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Hn—Z ⊗RC 0– -! Hn—C ⊗RC 0– -! Hn−1—B ⊗RC 0– -! Hn−1—Z ⊗RC 0– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 where we have Hn−1—B ⊗RC 0– instead of the expected Hn—B ⊗RC 0– since @ : C!B de- creases dimension by one. Checking deﬁnitions, one sees that the ‘boundary’ map Hn−1—B ⊗RC 0–!Hn−1—Z ⊗RC 0– in the preceding long exact sequence is just the map induced by the natural map B ⊗RC 0!Z ⊗RC 0 coming from the inclusion B ˆ Z . Since Z and B are chain complexes with trivial boundary maps, the special case at the beginning of the proof converts the preceding exact sequence into \u0001\u0001\u0001 in-----! L i( Zi ⊗R Hn−i—C 0–\u0001 -! Hn—C ⊗R C 0– -! L i( Bi ⊗R Hn−i−1—C 0–\u0001 in−1------------! L i( Zi ⊗R Hn−i−1—C 0–\u0001 -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 So we have short exact sequences 0 -! Coker in -! Hn—C ⊗R C 0– -! Ker in−1 -! 0 The General K¨unneth Formula Section 3.B 275 where Coker in … L i( Zi ⊗RHn−i—C 0–\u0001 = Im in , and this equals L i( Hi—C– ⊗RHn−i—C 0–\u0001 by Lemma 3A.1. It remains to identify Ker in−1 with LiTorR( Hi—C–; Hn−i—C 0–\u0001 . By the deﬁnition of Tor , tensoring the free resolution 0!Bi!Zi!Hi—C–!0 with Hn−i—C 0– yields an exact sequence 0 -! TorR( Hi—C–; Hn−i—C 0–\u0001 -! Bi ⊗R Hn−i—C 0– -! Zi ⊗R Hn−i—C 0– -! Hi—C–⊗R Hn−i—C 0– -! 0 Hence, summing over i , Ker in … L iTorR( Hi—C–; Hn−i—C 0–\u0001 . Naturality should be obvious, and we leave it for the reader to ﬁll in the details. We will show that the short exact sequence in the statement of the theorem splits assuming that both C and C 0 are free. This sufﬁces for our applications. For the extra argument needed to show splitting when C 0 is not free, see the exposition in [Hilton & Stammbach 1970]. The splitting is via a homomorphism Hn—C ⊗RC 0–! L i( Hi—C– ⊗RHn−i—C 0–\u0001 con- structed in the following way. As already noted, the sequence 0!Zi!Ci!Bi−1!0 splits, so the quotient maps Zi!Hi—C– extend to homomorphisms Ci!Hi—C– . Sim- ilarly we obtain C 0 j!Hj—C 0– if C 0 is free. Viewing the sequences of homology groups Hi—C– and Hj—C 0– as chain complexes H—C– and H—C 0– with trivial boundary maps, we thus have chain maps C!H—C– and C 0!H—C 0– , whose tensor product is a chain map C ⊗RC 0!H—C– ⊗RH—C 0– . The induced map on homology for this last chain map is the desired splitting map since the chain complex H—C– ⊗RH—C 0– equals its own homology, the boundary maps being trivial. tu The Topological K¨unneth Formula Now we can apply the preceding algebra to obtain the topological statement we are looking for: Theorem 3B.6. If X and Y are CW complexes and R is a principal ideal domain, then there are natural short exact sequences 0 -! L i( Hi—X; R–⊗R Hn−i—Y ; R–\u0001 -! Hn—X \u0002 Y ; R– -! L iTorR( Hi—X; R–; Hn−i−1—Y ; R–\u0001 -! 0 and these sequences split. Naturality means that maps X!X0 and Y!Y 0 induce a map from the short exact sequence for X \u0002 Y to the corresponding short exact sequence for X0 \u0002 Y 0 , with commuting squares. The splitting is not natural, however, as an exercise at the end of this section demonstrates. Proof: When dealing with products of CW complexes there is always the bothersome fact that the compactly generated CW topology may not be the same as the product topology. However, in the present context this is not a real problem. Since the two 276 Chapter 3 Cohomology topologies have the same compact sets, they have the same singular simplices and hence the same singular homology groups. Let C … C\u0003—X; R– and C 0 … C\u0003—Y ; R– , the cellular chain complexes with coefﬁ- cients in R . Then C ⊗RC 0 … C\u0003—X \u0002 Y ; R– by Proposition 3B.1, so the algebraic K¨unneth formula gives the desired short exact sequences. Their naturality follows from natu- rality in the algebraic K¨unneth formula, since we can homotope arbitrary maps X!X0 and Y!Y 0 to be cellular by Theorem 4.8, assuring that they induce chain maps of cellular chain complexes. tu With ﬁeld coefﬁcients the K¨unneth formula simpliﬁes because the Tor terms are always zero over a ﬁeld: Corollary 3B.7. If F is a ﬁeld and X and Y are CW complexes, then the cross product map h : L i( Hi—X; F– ⊗F Hn−i—Y ; F–\u0001 -! Hn—X \u0002 Y ; F– is an isomorphism for all n . tu There is also a relative version of the K¨unneth formula for CW pairs —X; A– and —Y ; B– . This is a split short exact sequence 0 -! L i( Hi—X; A; R–⊗R Hn−i—Y ; B; R–\u0001 -! Hn—X \u0002 Y; A\u0002 Y [ X \u0002 B; R– -! L iTorR( Hi—X; A; R–; Hn−i−1—Y ; B; R–\u0001 -! 0 for R a principal ideal domain. This too follows from the algebraic K¨unneth formula since the isomorphism of cellular chain complexes C\u0003—X \u0002 Y– ˇ C\u0003—X– ⊗ C\u0003—Y – passes down to a quotient isomorphism C\u0003—X \u0002 Y –=C\u0003—A\u0002 Y [ X \u0002 B– ˇ C\u0003—X–=C\u0003—A– ⊗ C\u0003—Y –=C\u0003—B– since bases for these three relative cellular chain complexes correspond bijectively with the cells of —X − A–\u0002 —Y − B– , X − A , and Y − B , respectively. As a special case, suppose A and B are basepoints x0 2 X and y0 2 Y . Then the subcomplex A\u0002 Y [ X \u0002 B can be identiﬁed with the wedge sum X _ Y and the quotient X \u0002 Y=X _ Y is the smash product X ^ Y . Thus we have a reduced K¨unneth formula 0 -! L i( eHi—X; R–⊗R eHn−i—Y ; R–\u0001 -! eHn—X ^ Y ; R– -! L iTorR( eHi—X; R–; eHn−i−1—Y ; R–\u0001 -! 0 If we take Y … S k for example, then X ^ S k is the k fold reduced suspension of X , and we obtain isomorphisms eHn—X; R– ˇ eHn‡k—X ^ S k; R– . The K¨unneth formula and the universal coefﬁcient theorem can be combined to give a more concise formula Hn—X \u0002 Y ; R– ˇ L i Hi( X; Hn−i—Y ; R–\u0001 . The naturality of this isomorphism is somewhat problematic, however, since it uses the splittings in the K¨unneth formula and universal coefﬁcient theorem. With a little more algebra the formula can be shown to hold more generally for an arbitrary coefﬁcient group G in place of R ; see [Hilton & Wylie 1967], p. 227. The General K¨unneth Formula Section 3.B 277 There is an analogous formula eHn—X ^ Y ; R– ˇ L i eHi( X; eHn−i—Y ; R–\u0001 . As a spe- cial case, when Y is a Moore space M—G; k– we obtain isomorphisms eHn—X; G– ˇ eHn‡k—X ^ M—G; k–; Z– . Again naturality is an issue, but in this case there is a natural isomorphism obtainable by applying Theorem 4.59 in x4.3, after verifying that the functors hn—X– … eHn‡k—X ^ M—G; k–; Z– deﬁne a reduced homology theory, which is not hard. The isomorphism eHn—X; G– ˇ eHn‡k—X^M—G; k–; Z– says that homology with arbitrary coefﬁcients can be obtained from homology with Z coefﬁcients by a topolog- ical construction as well as by the algebra of tensor products. For general homology theories this formula can be used as a deﬁnition of homology with coefﬁcients. One might wonder about a cohomology version of the K¨unneth formula. Tak- ing coefﬁcients in a ﬁeld F and using the natural isomorphism Hom—A ⊗ B; C– ˇ Hom( A; Hom—B; C– \u0001 , the K¨unneth formula for homology and the universal coefﬁcient theorem give isomorphisms Hn—X \u0002 Y ; F– ˇ HomF —Hn—X \u0002 Y ; F–; F – ˇ L iHomF —Hi—X; F–⊗Hn−i—Y ; F–; F – ˇ LiHomF ( Hi—X; F–; HomF —Hn−i—Y ; F–; F –\u0001 ˇ L iHomF ( Hi—X; F–; Hn−i—Y ; F–\u0001 ˇ L iHi( X; Hn−i—Y ; F–\u0001 More generally, there are isomorphisms Hn—X \u0002 Y ; G– ˇ L i Hi( X; Hn−i—Y ; G–\u0001 for any coefﬁcient group G ; see [Hilton & Wylie 1967], p. 227. However, in practice it usually sufﬁces to apply the K¨unneth formula for homology and the universal coefﬁcient theorem for cohomology separately. Also, Theorem 3.16 shows that with stronger hypotheses one can draw stronger conclusions using cup products. The Simplicial Cross Product Let us sketch how the cross product Hm—X; R– ⊗ Hn—Y ; R–!Hm‡n—X \u0002 Y ; R– can be deﬁned directly in terms of singular homology. What one wants is a cross prod- uct at the level of singular chains, Cm—X; R– ⊗ Cn—Y ; R–!Cm‡n—X \u0002 Y ; R– . Ifweare given singular simplices f : Ñ m!X and g : Ñ n!Y , then we have the product map f \u0002 g : Ñm \u0002 Ñn!X \u0002 Y , and the idea is to subdivide Ñ m \u0002 Ñ n into simplices of dimen- sion m ‡ n and then take the sum of the restrictions of f \u0002 g to these simplices, with appropriate signs. In the special cases that m or n is 1 we have already seen how to subdivide Ñm \u0002 Ñ n into simplices when we constructed prism operators in x2.1. The general- ization to Ñm \u0002 Ñn is not completely obvious, however. Label the vertices of Ñ m as v0;v1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vm and the vertices of Ñ n as w0;w1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn . Think of the pairs —i; j– with 0 \u0014 i \u0014 m and 0 \u0014 j \u0014 n as the vertices of an m\u0002 n rectangular grid in R 2 . Let ˙ be a path formed by a sequence of m ‡ n horizontal and vertical edges in this grid starting at —0; 0– and ending at —m; n– , always moving either to the right or upward. To such a path ˙ we associate a linear map `˙ : Ñ m‡n!Ñm \u0002 Ñ n sending the k th vertex of Ñ m‡n to —vik ;wjk – where —ik;jk– is the k th vertex of the edgepath ˙ . Then 278 Chapter 3 Cohomology we deﬁne a simplicial cross product Cm—X; R– ⊗ Cn—Y ; R– \u0002--------------! Cm‡n—X \u0002 Y ; R– by the formula f \u0002 g … X ˙ —−1– j˙ j—f \u0002 g–`˙ where j˙ j is the number of squares in the grid lying below the path ˙ . Note that the symbol ‘ \u0002 ’ means different things on the two sides of the equation. From this deﬁnition it is a calculation to show that @—f \u0002 g– … @f \u0002 g‡—−1– mf \u0002 @g . This implies that the cross product of two cycles is a cycle, and the cross product of a cycle and a boundary is a boundary, so there is an induced cross product in singular homology. One can see that the images of the maps `˙ give a simplicial structure on Ñ m \u0002 Ñn in the following way. We can view Ñ m as the subspace of R m deﬁned by the in- equalities 0 \u0014 x1 \u0014\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0014 xm \u0014 1 , with the vertex vi as the point having coordi- nates m − i zeros followed by i ones. Similarly we have Ñ n ˆ Rn with coordinates 0 \u0014 y1 \u0014 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0014 yn \u0014 1 . The product Ñ m \u0002 Ñ n then consists of —m ‡ n– tuples —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xm;y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;yn– satisfying both sets of inequalities. The combined inequal- ities 0 \u0014 x1 \u0014\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0014 xm \u0014 y1 \u0014 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0014 yn \u0014 1 deﬁne a simplex Ñm‡n in Ñm \u0002 Ñ n , and every other point of Ñm \u0002 Ñ n satisﬁes a similar set of inequalities obtained from 0 \u0014 x1 \u0014 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0014 xm \u0014 y1 \u0014 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0014 yn \u0014 1 by a permutation of the variables ‘shufﬂing’ the yj ’s into the xi ’s. Each such shufﬂe corresponds to an edgepath ˙ consisting of a rightward edge for each xi and an upward edge for each yj in the shufﬂed se- quence. Thus we have Ñm \u0002 Ñ n expressed as the union of simplices Ñ m‡n ˙ indexed by the edgepaths ˙ . One can check that these simplices ﬁt together nicely to form a Ñ complex structure on Ñ m \u0002 Ñn , which is also a simplicial complex structure. See [Eilenberg & Steenrod 1952], p. 68. In fact this construction is sufﬁciently natural to make the product of any two Ñ complexes into a Ñ complex. The Cohomology Cross Product In x3.2 we deﬁned a cross product Hk—X; R–\u0002 H`—Y ; R– \u0002--------------! Hk‡`—X \u0002 Y ; R– in terms of the cup product. Let us now describe the alternative approach in which the cross product is deﬁned directly via cellular cohomology, and then cup product is deﬁned in terms of this cross product. The cellular deﬁnition of cohomology cross product is very much like the deﬁni- tion in homology. Given CW complexes X and Y , deﬁne a cross product of cellular cochains ' 2 C k—X; R– and 2 C `—Y ; R– by setting —'\u0002 –—ek \u000b \u0002 e` \f– … '—ek \u000b– —e` \f– and letting '\u0002 take the value 0 on —k ‡ `– cells of X \u0002 Y which are not the product of a k cell of X with an ` cell of Y . Another way of saying this is to use the convention The General K¨unneth Formula Section 3.B 279 that a cellular cochain in C k—X; R– takes the value 0 on cells of dimension different from k , and then we can let —'\u0002 –—em \u000b \u0002 en \f – … '—em \u000b – —en \f – for all m and n . The cellular coboundary formula \u000e—'\u0002 – … \u000e'\u0002 ‡ —−1–k'\u0002 \u000e for cellular cochains ' 2 C k—X; R– and 2 C `—Y ; R– follows easily from the corresponding boundary formula in Proposition 3B.1, namely \u000e—'\u0002 –—em \u000b \u0002 en \f – … —'\u0002 –( @—em \u000b \u0002 en \f –\u0001 … —'\u0002 –—@em \u000b \u0002 en \f ‡ —−1–mem \u000b \u0002 @en \f – … \u000e'—em \u000b – —en \f – ‡ —−1–m'—em \u000b –\u000e —en \f – … —\u000e'\u0002 ‡ —−1–k'\u0002 \u000e –—em \u000b \u0002 en \f – where the coefﬁcient —−1–m in the next-to-last line can be replaced by —−1– k since '—em \u000b – … 0 unless k … m . From the formula \u000e—'\u0002 – … \u000e'\u0002 ‡ —−1– k'\u0002 \u000e it follows just as for homology and for cup product that there is an induced cross product in cellular cohomology. To show this agrees with the earlier deﬁnition, we can ﬁrst reduce to the case that X has trivial —k − 1– skeleton and Y has trivial —` − 1– skeleton via the commutative diagram¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! XH k(); XH k(); R R YH `(); Y Y H `(); R R XH k `(); H k `(); R R £ £ £ £ £ £ + +-k 1 -` 1X/ X -k 1X/Y/ Y -` 1Y/ The left-hand vertical map is surjective, so by commutativity, if the two deﬁnitions of cross product agree in the upper row, they agree in the lower row. Next, assuming Xk−1 and Y `−1 are trivial, consider the commutative diagram¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! XH k(); XH kk k(); R R YH `(); Y Y YH `` `(); R R XH k `(); XH k `(); R R £ £ £ £ £ £ + + The vertical maps here are injective, Xk \u0002 Y ` being the —k ‡ `– skeleton of X \u0002 Y ,so it sufﬁces to see that the two deﬁnitions agree in the lower row. We have Xk … W \u000b S k \u000b and Y ` … W \f S ` \f , so by restriction to these wedge summands the question is reduced ﬁnally to the case of a product S k \u000b \u0002 S ` \f . In this case, taking R … Z , we showed in Theorem 3.16 that the cross product in question is the map Z\u0002 Z!Z sending —1; 1– to \u00061 , with the original deﬁnition of cross product. The same is obviously true using the cellular cross product. So for R … Z the two cross products agree up to sign, and it follows that this is also true for arbitrary R . We leave it to the reader to sort out the matter of signs. To relate cross product to cup product we use the diagonal map Ñ : X!X \u0002 X , x , —x; x– . If we are given a deﬁnition of cross product, we can deﬁne cup product as the composition Hk—X; R–\u0002 H`—X; R– \u0002--------------! Hk‡`—X \u0002 X; R– ∆\u0003 --------------------! Hk‡`—X; R– 280 Chapter 3 Cohomology This agrees with the original deﬁnition of cup product since we have Ñ \u0003—a\u0002 b– … Ñ\u0003( p\u0003 1 —a– ` p\u0003 2 —b– \u0001 … Ñ \u0003( p\u0003 1 —a– \u0001 ` Ñ \u0003( p\u0003 2 —b– \u0001 … a ` b , as both compositions p1Ñ and p2Ñ are the identity map of X . Unfortunately, the deﬁnition of cellular cross product cannot be combined with Ñ to give a deﬁnition of cup product at the level of cellular cochains. This is because Ñ is not a cellular map, so it does not induce a map of cellular cochains. It is possible to homotope Ñ to a cellular map by Theorem 4.8, but this involves arbitrary choices. For example, the diagonal of a square can be pushed across either adjacent triangle. In particular cases one might hope to understand the geometry well enough to compute an explicit cellular approximation to the diagonal map, but usually other techniques for computing cup products are preferable. The cohomology cross product satisﬁes the same commutativity relation as for homology, namely T \u0003—a\u0002 b– … —−1– k`b\u0002 a for T : X \u0002 Y!Y \u0002 X the transposition map, a 2 Hk—Y ; R– , and b 2 H`—X; R– . The proof is the same as for homology. Taking X … Y and noting that T Ñ … Ñ , we obtain a new proof of the commutativity property of cup product. Exercises 1. Compute the groups Hi—RPm \u0002 RPn; G– and Hi—RPm \u0002 RPn; G– for G … Z and Z2 via the cellular chain and cochain complexes. [See Example 3B.4.] 2. Let C and C 0 be chain complexes, and let I be the chain complex consisting of Z in dimension 1 and Z\u0002 Z in dimension 0 , with the boundary map taking a gener- ator e in dimension 1 to the difference v1 − v0 of generators vi of the two Z ’s in dimension 0 . Show that a chain map f : I ⊗ C!C 0 is precisely the same as a chain homotopy between the two chain maps fi : C!C 0 , c , f—vi ⊗ c– , i … 0; 1 . [The chain homotopy is h—c– … f—e ⊗ c– .] 3. Show that the splitting in the topological K¨unneth formula cannot be natural by con- sidering the map f \u0002 11: M—Zm;n–\u0002 M—Zm;n–!S n‡1 \u0002 M—Zm;n– where f collapses the n skeleton of M—Zm;n– … S n [ en‡1 to a point. 4. Show that the cross product of fundamental classes for closed R orientable mani- folds M and N is a fundamental class for M \u0002 N . 5. Show that slant products Hn—X \u0002 Y ; R–\u0002 Hj—Y ; R– -! Hn−j—X; R–; —ei \u0002 ej;'– , '—ej–ei Hn—X \u0002 Y ; R–\u0002 Hj—Y ; R– -! Hn−j—X; R–; —'; ej– , ( ei , '—ei \u0002 ej–\u0001 can be deﬁned via the indicated cellular formulas. [These ‘products’ are in some ways more like division than multiplication, and this is reﬂected in the common notation a=b for them, or anb when the order of the factors is reversed. The ﬁrst of the two slant products is related to cap product in the same way that the cohomology cross product is related to cup product.] H–Spaces and Hopf Algebras Section 3.C 281 Of the three axioms for a group, it would seem that the least subtle is the existence of an identity element. However, we shall see in this section that when topology is added to the picture, the identity axiom becomes much more potent. To give a name to the objects we will be considering, deﬁne a space X to be an H–space, ‘H’ standing for ‘Hopf,’ if there is a continuous multiplication map \u0016 : X \u0002 X!X and an ‘identity’ element e 2 X such that the two maps X!X given by x , \u0016—x; e– and x , \u0016—e; x– are homotopic to the identity through maps —X; e–!—X; e– . In particular, this implies that \u0016—e; e– … e . In terms of generality, this deﬁnition represents something of a middle ground. One could weaken the deﬁnition by dropping the condition that the homotopies pre- serve the basepoint e , or one could strengthen it by requiring that e be a strict identity, without any homotopies. An exercise at the end of the section is to show the three possible deﬁnitions are equivalent if X is a CW complex. An advantage of allowing homotopies in the deﬁnition is that a space homotopy equivalent in the basepointed sense to an H–space is again an H–space. Imposing basepoint conditions is fairly standard in homotopy theory, and is usually not a serious restriction. The most classical examples of H–spaces are topological groups, spaces X with a group structure such that both the multiplication map X \u0002 X!X and the inversion map X!X , x , x−1 , are continuous. For example, the group GLn—R– of invertible n\u0002 n matrices with real entries is a topological group when topologized as a subspace of the n2 dimensional vector space Mn—R– of all n\u0002 n matrices over R . It is an open subspace since the invertible matrices are those with nonzero determinant, and the determinant function Mn—R–!R is continuous. Matrix multiplication is certainly continuous, being deﬁned by simple algebraic formulas, and it is not hard to see that matrix inversion is also continuous if one thinks for example of the classical adjoint formula for the inverse matrix. Likewise GLn—C– is a topological group, as is the quaternionic analog GLn—H– , though in the latter case one needs a somewhat different justiﬁcation since deter- minants of quaternionic matrices do not have the good properties one would like. Since these groups GLn over R , C , and H are open subsets of Euclidean spaces, they are examples of Lie groups, which can be deﬁned as topological groups which are also manifolds. The GLn groups are noncompact, being open subsets of Euclidean spaces, but they have the homotopy types of compact Lie groups O—n– , U—n– , and Sp—n– . This is explained in x3.D for GLn—R– , and the other two cases are similar. Among the simplest H–spaces from a topological viewpoint are the unit spheres S 1 in C , S 3 in the quaternions H , and S 7 in the octonions O . These are H–spaces since the multiplications in these division algebras are continuous, being deﬁned by 282 Chapter 3 Cohomology polynomial formulas, and are norm-preserving, jabj…jajjbj , hence restrict to multi- plications on the unit spheres, and the identity element of the division algebra lies in the unit sphere in each case. Both S 1 and S 3 are Lie groups since the multiplications in C and H are associative and inverses exist since aa …jaj 2 … 1if jaj… 1 . How- ever, S 7 is not a group since multiplication of octonions is not associative. Of course S 0 …f\u00061g is also a topological group, trivially. A famous theorem of J. F. Adams as- serts that S 0 , S 1 , S 3 , and S 7 are the only spheres that are H–spaces; see x4.B for a fuller discussion. Let us describe now some associative H–spaces where inverses fail to exist. Multi- plication of polynomials provides an H–space structure on CP1 in the following way. A nonzero polynomial a0 ‡ a1z ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ anzn with coefﬁcients ai 2 C corresponds to a point —a0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;an; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001– 2 C 1 −f0g . Multiplication of two such polynomials determines a multiplication C1 −f0g\u0002 C 1 −f0g!C 1 −f0g which is associative, com- mutative, and has an identity element —1; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . Since C is commutative we can factor out by scalar multiplication by nonzero constants and get an induced product CP1 \u0002 CP1!CP1 with the same properties. Thus CP1 is an associative, commutative H–space with a strict identity. Instead of factoring out by all nonzero scalars, we could factor out only by scalars of the form ˆe2ˇ ik=q with ˆ an arbitrary positive real, k an arbitrary integer, and q a ﬁxed positive integer. The quotient of C 1 −f0g under this identiﬁcation, an inﬁnite-dimensional lens space L 1 with ˇ1—L1– ˇ Zq , is therefore also an associative, commutative H–space. This includes RP1 in particular. The spaces J—X– deﬁned in x3.2 are also H–spaces, with the multiplication given by —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xm–—y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;yn– … —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xm;y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;yn– , which is associative and has an identity element —e– where e is the basepoint of X . One could describe J—X– as the free associative H–space generated by X . There is also a commutative ana- log of J—X– called the inﬁnite symmetric product SP —X– deﬁned in the following way. Let SPn—X– be the quotient space of the n fold product Xn obtained by iden- tifying all n tuples —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn– that differ only by a permutation of their coordi- nates. The inclusion Xn > Xn‡1 , —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn–, —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn;e– induces an inclusion SPn—X–>SPn‡1—X– , and SP —X– is deﬁned to be the union of this increasing sequence of SPn—X– ’s, with the weak topology. Alternatively, SP —X– is the quotient of J—X– obtained by identifying points that differ only by permutation of coordinates. The H–space structure on J—X– induces an H–space structure on SP —X– which is commu- tative in addition to being associative and having a strict identity. The spaces SP —X– are studied in more detail in x4.K. The goal of this section will be to describe the extra structure which the multi- plication in an H–space gives to its homology and cohomology. This is of particular interest since many of the most important spaces in algebraic topology turn out to be H–spaces. H–Spaces and Hopf Algebras Section 3.C 283 Hopf Algebras Let us look at cohomology ﬁrst. Choosing a commutative ring R as coefﬁcient ring, we can regard the cohomology ring H\u0003—X; R– of a space X as an algebra over R rather than merely a ring. Suppose X is an H–space satisfying two conditions: (1) X is path-connected, hence H0—X; R– ˇ R . (2) Hn—X; R– is a ﬁnitely generated free R module for each n , so the cross product H\u0003—X; R– ⊗R H\u0003—X; R–!H\u0003—X \u0002 X; R– is an isomorphism. The multiplication \u0016 : X \u0002 X!X induces a map \u0016\u0003 : H\u0003—X; R–!H\u0003—X \u0002 X; R– , and when we combine this with the cross product isomorphism in (2) we get a map H\u0003—X; R– ∆--------------! H\u0003—X; R– ⊗R H\u0003—X; R– which is an algebra homomorphism since both \u0016\u0003 and the cross product isomorphism are algebra homomorphisms. The key property of Ñ turns out to be that for any \u000b 2 Hn—X; R– , n> 0 , we have Ñ—\u000b– … \u000b ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b ‡ X 0<i<n \u000b0 i ⊗ \u000b 00 n−i where j\u000b0 jj… j …j\u000b 00 j j To verify this, let i : X!X \u0002 X be the inclusion x , —x; e– for e the identity element of X , and consider the commutative diagram ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! XH (); RXH (); XR XH (); R£ £ ¤¤ ¤ XH (); R XH (); RR P ¤¤ ¤ ¤ \u0000 \u0000 XH (); R eH (); RR ¤¤ \u0000 i ¤i ƒ ¹ ¼ ¡¡¡¡¡!£ ¼ 11 The map P is deﬁned by commutativity, and by looking at the lower right triangle we see that P—\u000b ⊗ 1– … \u000b and P—\u000b ⊗ \f– … 0if j\fj > 0 . The H–space property says that \u0016i ' 11, so P Ñ … 11 . This implies that the component of Ñ—\u000b– in Hn—X; R– ⊗R H0—X; R– is \u000b ⊗ 1 . A similar argument shows the component in H0—X; R– ⊗R Hn—X; R– is 1 ⊗ \u000b . We can summarize this situation by saying that H\u0003—X; R– is a Hopf algebra, that is, a graded algebra A … L n\u00150 A n over a commutative base ring R , satisfying the following two conditions: (1) There is an identity element 1 2 A0 such that the map R!A0 , r , r \u0001 1 , is an isomorphism; one says A is connected. (2) There is a diagonal or coproduct Ñ : A!A ⊗ A , a homomorphism of graded al- gebras satisfying Ñ—\u000b– … \u000b ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b ‡ P 0<i<n \u000b 0 i ⊗ \u000b00 n−i for \u000b 2 A n , n> 0 , and \u000b0 j;\u000b 00 j 2 A j . Here and in what follows we take ⊗ to mean ⊗R . The multiplication in A ⊗ A is given by the standard formula —\u000b ⊗ \f–—γ ⊗ \u000e– … —−1– jk—\u000bγ ⊗ \f\u000e– where \f 2 A j and γ 2 A k . For a general Hopf algebra the multiplication is not assumed to be either associative or commutative (in the graded sense), though in the example of H\u0003—X; R– for X an H–space the algebra structure is of course associative and commutative. 284 Chapter 3 Cohomology Example 3C.1. One of the simplest Hopf algebras is a polynomial ring Rƒ\u000b⁄ . The coproduct Ñ—\u000b– must equal \u000b ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b since the only elements of Rƒ\u000b⁄ of lower dimension than \u000b are the elements of R in dimension zero, so the terms \u000b 0 i and \u000b00 n−i in the coproduct formula Ñ—\u000b– … \u000b ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b ‡ P 0<i<n \u000b0 i ⊗ \u000b 00 n−i must be zero. The requirement that Ñ be an algebra homomorphism then determines Ñ completely. To describe Ñ explicitly we distinguish two cases. If the dimension of \u000b is even or if 2 … 0 in R , then the multiplication in Rƒ\u000b⁄ ⊗ Rƒ\u000b⁄ is strictly commutative and Ñ—\u000b n– … —\u000b ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b– n … P i \u0010n i \u0011\u000b i ⊗ \u000b n−i . In the opposite case that \u000b is odd-dimensional, then Ñ—\u000b2– … —\u000b ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b– 2 … \u000b2 ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b2 since —\u000b ⊗ 1–—1 ⊗ \u000b– … \u000b ⊗ \u000b and —1 ⊗ \u000b–—\u000b ⊗ 1– …−\u000b ⊗ \u000b if \u000b has odd dimension. Thus if we set \f … \u000b 2 , then \f is even-dimensional and we have Ñ—\u000b2n– … Ñ—\f n– … —\f ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \f– n … P i \u0010 n i \u0011\f i ⊗ \f n−i and Ñ—\u000b2n‡1– … Ñ—\u000b\f n– … Ñ—\u000b–Ñ—\f n– … P i \u0010 n i \u0011\u000b\f i ⊗ \fn−i ‡ Pi \u0010n i \u0011\f i ⊗ \u000b\f n−i . Example 3C.2. The exterior algebra ÓRƒ\u000b⁄ on an odd-dimensional generator \u000b is a Hopf algebra, with Ñ—\u000b– … \u000b ⊗ 1‡1 ⊗ \u000b . To verify that Ñ is an algebra homomorphism we must check that Ñ—\u000b2– … Ñ—\u000b– 2 , or in other words, since \u000b 2 … 0 , we need to see that Ñ—\u000b–2 … 0 . As in the preceding example we have Ñ—\u000b– 2 … —\u000b ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b–2 … \u000b2 ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b 2 ,so Ñ—\u000b– 2 is indeed 0 . Note that if \u000b were even-dimensional we would instead have Ñ—\u000b–2 … \u000b 2 ⊗ 1 ‡ 2\u000b ⊗ \u000b ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b 2 , which would be 0 in ÓRƒ\u000b⁄ ⊗ ÓRƒ\u000b⁄ only if 2 … 0in R . An element \u000b of a Hopf algebra is called primitive if Ñ—\u000b– … \u000b ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b . As the preceding examples illustrate, if a Hopf algebra is generated as an algebra by primitive elements, then the coproduct Ñ is uniquely determined by the product. This happens in a number of interesting special cases, but certainly not in general, as we shall see. The existence of the coproduct in a Hopf algebra turns out to restrict the multi- plicative structure considerably. Here is an important example illustrating this: Example 3C.3. Suppose that the truncated polynomial algebra F ƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b n– over a ﬁeld F is a Hopf algebra. Then \u000b is primitive, just as it is in F ƒ\u000b⁄ , so if we assume either that \u000b is even-dimensional or that F has characteristic 2 , then the relation \u000b n … 0 yields an equation 0 … Ñ—\u000bn– … \u000b n ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b n ‡ X 0<i<n \u0010 n i \u0011\u000b i ⊗ \u000b n−i … X 0<i<n \u0010 n i \u0011\u000b i ⊗ \u000b n−i which implies that \u0010 n i \u0011 … 0in F for each i in the range 0 <i<n . This is impossible if F has characteristic 0 , and if the characteristic of F is p> 0 then it happens only when n is a power of p . For p … 2 this was shown in the proof of Theorem 3.20, and the argument given there works just as well for odd primes. Conversely, it is easy to check that if F has characteristic p then F ƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b pi – is a Hopf algebra, assuming still that \u000b is even-dimensional if p is odd. The characteristic 0 case of this result implies that CPn is not an H–space for ﬁnite n , in contrast with CP1 which is an H–space as we saw earlier. Similarly, taking H–Spaces and Hopf Algebras Section 3.C 285 F … Z2 , we deduce that RPn can be an H–space only if n ‡ 1 is a power of 2 . Indeed, RP1 … S 1=\u00061, RP3 … S 3=\u00061 , and RP7 … S 7=\u00061 have quotient H–space structures from S 1 , S 3 and S 7 since −1 commutes with all elements of S 1 , S 3 ,or S 7 . However, these are the only cases when RPn is an H–space since, by an exercise at the end of this section, the universal cover of an H–space is an H–space, and S 1 , S 3 , and S 7 are the only spheres that are H–spaces, by the theorem of Adams mentioned earlier. It is an easy exercise to check that the tensor product of Hopf algebras is again a Hopf algebra, with the coproduct Ñ—\u000b ⊗ \f– … Ñ—\u000b– ⊗ Ñ—\f– . So the preceding examples yield many other Hopf algebras, tensor products of polynomial, truncated polynomial, and exterior algebras on any number of generators. The following theorem of Hopf is a partial converse: Theorem 3C.4. If A is a commutative, associative Hopf algebra over a ﬁeld F of characteristic 0 , and A n is ﬁnite-dimensional over F for each n , then A is isomor- phic as an algebra to the tensor product of an exterior algebra on odd-dimensional generators and a polynomial algebra on even-dimensional generators. There is an analogous theorem of Borel when F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld of characteris- tic p . In this case A is again isomorphic to a tensor product of single-generator Hopf algebras, of one of the following types: F ƒ\u000b⁄ , with \u000b even-dimensional if p ﬂ 2. ÓF ƒ\u000b⁄ with \u000b odd-dimensional. F ƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b pi – , with \u000b even-dimensional if p ﬂ 2. For a proof see [Borel 1953] or [Kane 1988]. Proof of 3C.4: Since A n is ﬁnitely generated over F for each n , we may choose algebra generators x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 for A with xi 2 A jxij and jxij\u0014jxi‡1j for all i . Let An be the subalgebra generated by x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn . This is a Hopf subalgebra of A , that is, Ñ—An– ˆ An ⊗ An , since Ñ—xi– involves only xi and terms of smaller dimension. We may assume xn does not lie in An−1 . Since A is associative and commutative, there is a natural surjection An−1 ⊗ Fƒxn⁄!An if jxnj is even, or An−1 ⊗ ÓF ƒxn⁄!An if jxnj is odd. By induction on n it will sufﬁce to prove these surjections are injective. Thus in the two cases we must rule out nontrivial relations Pi \u000bixi n … 0 and \u000b0 ‡\u000b1xn … 0, respectively, with coefﬁcients \u000bi 2 An−1 . Let I be the ideal in An generated by x2 n and the positive-dimensional elements of An−1 ,so I consists of the polynomials P i \u000bixi n with coefﬁcients \u000bi 2 An−1 , the ﬁrst two coefﬁcients \u000b0 and \u000b1 having trivial components in A 0 . Note that xn 62 I since elements of I having dimension jxnj must lie in An−1 . Consider the composition An ∆-----------------! An ⊗ An q --------------! An ⊗ —An=I– with q the natural quotient map. By the deﬁnition of I , this composition qÑ sends \u000b 2 An−1 to \u000b ⊗ 1 and xn to xn ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ xn where xn is the image of xn in An=I . 286 Chapter 3 Cohomology In case jxnj is even, applying qÑ to a nontrivial relation P i \u000bixi n … 0 gives 0 … Pi—\u000bi ⊗ 1–—xn ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ xn– i … (P i \u000bixi n\u0001 ⊗ 1 ‡ Pi i\u000bixi−1 n ⊗ xn Since P i \u000bixi n … 0 , this implies that P i i\u000bixi−1 n ⊗ xn is zero in the tensor product An ⊗ —An=I– , hence P i i\u000bixi−1 n … 0 since xn 62 I implies xn ﬂ 0 . The relation Pi i\u000bixi−1 n … 0 has lower degree than the original relation, and is not the trivial rela- tion since F has characteristic 0 , \u000bi ﬂ 0 implying i\u000bi ﬂ 0if i> 0 . Since we could assume the original relation had minimum degree, we have reached a contradiction. The case jxnj odd is similar. Applying qÑ to a relation \u000b0 ‡ \u000b1xn … 0 gives 0 … \u000b0 ⊗ 1‡—\u000b1 ⊗ 1–—xn ⊗ 1‡1 ⊗ xn– … —\u000b0 ‡\u000b1xn– ⊗ 1‡\u000b1 ⊗ xn . Since \u000b0 ‡\u000b1xn … 0, we get \u000b1 ⊗ xn … 0 , which implies \u000b1 … 0 and hence \u000b0 … 0. tu The structure of Hopf algebras over Z is much more complicated than over a ﬁeld. Here is an example that is still fairly simple. Example 3C.5: Divided Polynomial Algebras. We showed in Proposition 3.22 that the H–space J—S n– for n even has H\u0003—J—S n–; Z– a divided polynomial algebra, the algebra ÐZƒ\u000b⁄ with additive generators \u000bi in dimension ni and multiplication given by \u000b k 1 … k!\u000bk , hence \u000bi\u000bj … \u0010i‡j i \u0011\u000bi‡j . The coproduct in ÐZƒ\u000b⁄ is uniquely determined by the multiplicative structure since Ñ—\u000b k 1– … —\u000b1 ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u000b1–k … P i \u0010k i\u0011\u000b i 1 ⊗ \u000b k−i 1 , which implies that Ñ—\u000bk 1=k!– … Pi—\u000bi 1=i!– ⊗ —\u000b k−i 1 =—k − i–!– , that is, Ñ—\u000bk– … Pi \u000bi ⊗ \u000bk−i .So in this case the coproduct has a simpler description than the product. It is interesting to see what happens to the divided polynomial algebra ÐZƒ\u000b⁄ when we change to ﬁeld coefﬁcients. Clearly ÐQƒ\u000b⁄ is the same as Qƒ\u000b⁄ . In contrast with this, ÐZp ƒ\u000b⁄ , with multiplication deﬁned by \u000bi\u000bj … \u0010i‡j i \u0011\u000bi‡j , happens to be isomorphic as an algebra to the inﬁnite tensor product Ni\u00150 Zpƒ\u000bpi ⁄=—\u000b p pi – ,as we will show in a moment. However, as Hopf algebras these two objects are different since \u000bpi is primitive in N i\u00150 Zpƒ\u000bpi ⁄=—\u000b p pi – but not in ÐZp ƒ\u000b⁄ when i> 0 , since the coproduct in ÐZp ƒ\u000b⁄ is given by Ñ—\u000bk– … P i \u000bi ⊗ \u000bk−i . Now let us show that there is an algebra isomorphism ÐZp ƒ\u000b⁄ ˇ N i\u00150 Zpƒ\u000bpi ⁄=—\u000b p pi – Since ÐZp ƒ\u000b⁄ … ÐZƒ\u000b⁄ ⊗ Zp , this is equivalent to: —\u0003– The element \u000bn0 1 \u000b n1 p \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u000b nk pk in ÐZƒ\u000b⁄ is divisible by p iff ni \u0015 p for some i . The product \u000bn0 1 \u000b n1 p \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u000b nk pk equals m\u000bn for n … n0 ‡ n1p ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ nkpk and some integer m . The question is whether p divides m . We will show: —\u0003\u0003–\u000bn\u000bpk is divisible by p iff nk … p − 1 , assuming that ni <p for each i . This implies —\u0003– by an inductive argument in which we build up the product in —\u0003– by repeated multiplication on the right by terms \u000bpi . H–Spaces and Hopf Algebras Section 3.C 287 To prove —\u0003\u0003– we recall that \u000bn\u000bpk … \u0010n‡pk n \u0011\u000bn‡pk . The mod p value of this binomial coefﬁcient can be computed using Lemma 3C.6 below. Assuming that ni <p for each i and that nk ‡1 <p , the p adic representations of n‡pk and n differ only in the coefﬁcient of pk , so mod p we have \u0010 n‡pk n \u0011 … \u0010 nk‡1 nk \u0011 … nk ‡ 1 . This conclusion also holds if nk ‡ 1 … p , when the p adic representations of n ‡ pk and n differ also in the coefﬁcient of pk‡1 . The statement —\u0003\u0003– then follows. Lemma 3C.6. If p is a prime, then \u0010 n k\u0011 \u0011 Q i \u0010ni ki \u0011 mod p where n … P i nipi and k … Pi kipi with 0 \u0014 ni <p and 0 \u0014 ki <p are the p adic representations of n and k . Here the convention is that \u0010n k\u0011 … 0if n<k , and \u0010 n 0\u0011 … 1 for all n \u0015 0. Proof:In Zpƒx⁄ there is an identity —1 ‡ x– p … 1 ‡ xp since p clearly divides \u0010p k\u0011 … p!=k!—p − k–! for 0 <k<p . By induction it follows that —1 ‡ x–pi … 1 ‡ xpi . Hence if n … Pi nipi is the p adic representation of n then: —1 ‡ x–n … —1 ‡ x– n0 —1 ‡ xp–n1 —1 ‡ xp2 –n2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 … h 1 ‡ \u0010n0 1 \u0011x ‡ \u0010n0 2 \u0011x2 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ \u0010 n0 p−1 \u0011xp−1i \u0002 h 1 ‡ \u0010n1 1 \u0011xp ‡ \u0010n1 2 \u0011x2p ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ \u0010 n1 p−1 \u0011x—p−1–pi \u0002 h 1 ‡ \u0010n2 1 \u0011xp2 ‡ \u0010n2 2 \u0011x2p2 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ \u0010 n2 p−1 \u0011x—p−1–p2 i\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 When this is multiplied out, one sees that no terms combine, and the coefﬁcient of xk is just Q i \u0010 ni ki \u0011 where k … P i kipi is the p adic representation of k . tu Pontryagin Product Another special feature of H–spaces is that their homology groups have a prod- uct operation, called the Pontryagin product. For an H–space X with multiplication \u0016 : X \u0002 X!X , this is the composition H\u0003—X; R– ⊗ H\u0003—X; R– \u0002--------------! H\u0003—X \u0002 X; R– \u0016\u0003--------------! H\u0003—X; R– where the ﬁrst map is the cross product deﬁned in x3.B. Thus the Pontryagin product consists of bilinear maps Hi—X; R–\u0002 Hj—X; R–!Hi‡j—X; R– . Unlike cup product, the Pontryagin product is not in general associative unless the multiplication \u0016 is associa- tive or at least associative up to homotopy, in the sense that the maps X \u0002 X \u0002 X!X , —x;y;z– , \u0016—x; \u0016—y; z–– and —x;y;z– , \u0016—\u0016—x; y–; z– are homotopic. Fortunately most H–spaces one meets in practice satisfy this associativity property. Nor is the Pontryagin product generally commutative, even in the graded sense, unless \u0016 is commutative or homotopy-commutative, which is relatively rare for H–spaces. We will give examples shortly where the Pontryagin product is not commutative. 288 Chapter 3 Cohomology In case X is a CW complex and \u0016 is a cellular map the Pontryagin product can be computed using cellular homology via the cellular chain map Ci—X; R–\u0002 Cj—X; R– \u0002--------------! Ci‡j—X \u0002 X; R– \u0016\u0003--------------! Ci‡j—X; R– where the cross product map sends generators corresponding to cells ei and ej to the generator corresponding to the product cell ei \u0002 ej , and then \u0016\u0003 is applied to this product cell. Example 3C.7. Let us compute the Pontryagin product for J—S n– . Here there is one cell ein for each i \u0015 0 , and \u0016 takes the product cell ein \u0002 ejn homeomorphically onto the cell e—i‡j–n . This means that H\u0003—J—S n–; Z– is simply the polynomial ring Zƒx⁄ on an n dimensional generator x . This holds for n odd as well as for n even, so the Pontryagin product need not satisfy the same general commutativity relation as cup product. In this example the Pontryagin product structure is simpler than the cup product structure, though for some H–spaces it is the other way round. In applications it is often convenient to have the choice of which product structure to use. This calculation immediately generalizes to J—X– where X is any connected CW complex whose cellular boundary maps are all trivial. The cellular boundary maps in the product Xm of m copies of X are then trivial by induction on m using Propo- sition 3B.1, and therefore the cellular boundary maps in J—X– are all trivial since the quotient map Xm!Jm—X– is cellular and each cell of Jm—X– is the homeomorphic image of a cell of Xm . Thus H\u0003—J—X–; Z– is free with additive basis the products en1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 enk of positive-dimensional cells of X , and the multiplicative structure is that of polynomials in noncommuting variables corresponding to the positive- dimensional cells of X . Another way to describe H\u0003—J—X–; Z– in this example is as the tensor algebra T eH\u0003—X; Z– , where for a graded R module M that is trivial in dimension zero, like the reduced homology of a path-connected space, the tensor algebra TM is the direct sum of the n fold tensor products of M with itself for all n \u0015 1 , together with a copy of R in dimension zero, with the obvious multiplication coming from tensor product and scalar multiplication. Generalizing the preceding example, we have: Proposition 3C.8. If X is a connected CW complex with H\u0003—X; R– a free R module, then H\u0003—J—X–; R– is isomorphic to the tensor algebra T eH\u0003—X; R– . This can be paraphrased as saying that the homology of the free H–space gener- ated by a space with free homology is the free algebra generated by the homology of the space. Proof: With coefﬁcients in R , let ' : T eH\u0003—X–!H\u0003( J—X– \u0001 be the homomorphism whose restriction to the n fold tensor product eH\u0003—X– ⊗n is the composition eH\u0003—X– ⊗n > H\u0003—X– ⊗n \u0002-----! H\u0003—Xn– -! H\u0003( Jn—X–\u0001 -! H\u0003( J—X– \u0001 H–Spaces and Hopf Algebras Section 3.C 289 where the next-to-last map is induced by the quotient map Xn!Jn—X– . It is clear that ' is a ring homomorphism since the product in J—X– is induced from the natural map Xm \u0002 Xn!Xm‡n . To show that ' is an isomorphism, consider the following commutative diagram of short exact sequences:¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡! n ¡¡¡¡!X 00 H n() » ¤XHT () » ¤¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! 0 ¡¡¡¡! n 1 XHT () » ¤ \u0000 ¡¡¡¡!X 0H n() » ¤ ^¡¡¡¡!XJn( ))H (¤¡¡¡¡! XJ ( ))H (¤ - n 1- ¼'' £ In the upper row, Tm eH\u0003—X– denotes the direct sum of the products eH\u0003—X– ⊗k for k \u0014 m , so this row is exact. The second row is the homology exact sequence for the pair ( Jn—X–; Jn−1—X–\u0001 , with quotient Jn—X–=Jn−1—X– the n fold smash product X^n . This long exact sequence breaks up into short exact sequences as indicated, by commutativity of the right-hand square and the fact that the right-hand vertical map is an isomorphism by the K¨unneth formula, using the hypothesis that H\u0003—X– is free over the given coefﬁcient ring. By induction on n and the ﬁve-lemma we deduce from the diagram that ' : Tn eH\u0003—X–!H\u0003( Jn—X–\u0001 is an isomorphism for all n . Letting n go to 1 , this implies that ' : T eH\u0003—X–!H\u0003( J—X– \u0001 is an isomorphism since in any given dimension Tn eH\u0003—X– is independent of n when n is sufﬁciently large, and the same is true of H\u0003( Jn—X–\u0001 by the second row of the diagram. tu Dual Hopf Algebras There is a close connection between the Pontryagin product in homology and the Hopf algebra structure on cohomology. Suppose that X is an H–space such that, with coefﬁcients in a ﬁeld R , the vector spaces Hn—X; R– are ﬁnite-dimensional for all n . Alternatively, we could take R … Z and assume Hn—X; Z– is ﬁnitely gener- ated and free for all n . In either case we have Hn—X; R– … HomR—Hn—X; R–; R– , and as a consequence the Pontryagin product H\u0003—X; R– ⊗ H\u0003—X; R–!H\u0003—X; R– and the coproduct Ñ : H\u0003—X; R–!H\u0003—X; R– ⊗ H\u0003—X; R– are dual to each other, both being in- duced by the H–space product \u0016 : X \u0002 X!X . Therefore the coproduct in cohomol- ogy determines the Pontryagin product in homology, and vice versa. Speciﬁcally, the component Ñij : Hi‡j—X; R–!Hi—X; R– ⊗ Hj—X; R– of Ñ is dual to the product Hi—X; R– ⊗ Hj—X; R–!Hi‡j—X; R– . Example 3C.9. Consider J—S n– with n even, so H\u0003—J—S n–; Z– is the divided poly- nomial algebra ÐZƒ\u000b⁄ . In Example 3C.5 we derived the coproduct formula Ñ—\u000bk– … Pi \u000bi ⊗ \u000bk−i . Thus Ñij takes \u000bi‡j to \u000bi ⊗ \u000bj ,so if xi is the generator of Hin—J—S n–; Z– dual to \u000bi , then xixj … xi‡j . This says that H\u0003—J—S n–; Z– is the polynomial ring Zƒx⁄ . We showed this in Example 3C.7 using the cell structure of J—S n– , but the present proof deduces it purely algebraically from the cup product structure. Now we wish to show that the relation between H\u0003—X; R– and H\u0003—X; R– is per- fectly symmetric: They are dual Hopf algebras. This is a purely algebraic fact: 290 Chapter 3 Cohomology Proposition 3C.10. Let A be a Hopf algebra over R that is a ﬁnitely generated free R module in each dimension. Then the product ˇ : A ⊗ A!A and coproduct Ñ : A!A ⊗ A have duals ˇ \u0003 : A \u0003!A \u0003 ⊗ A\u0003 and Ñ\u0003 : A \u0003 ⊗ A\u0003!A\u0003 that give A\u0003 the structure of a Hopf algebra. Proof: This will be apparent if we reinterpret the Hopf algebra structure on A for- mally as a pair of graded R module homomorphisms ˇ : A ⊗ A!A and Ñ : A!A ⊗ A together with an element 1 2 A0 satisfying: (1) The two compositions A i`-----! A ⊗ A ˇ-----! A and A ir-----! A ⊗ A ˇ-----! A are the identity, where i`—a– … a ⊗ 1 and ir —a– … 1 ⊗ a . This says that 1 is a two-sided identity for the multiplication in A . (2) The two compositions A Ñ-----! A ⊗ A p`-----! A and A Ñ-----! A ⊗ A pr-----! A are the identity, where p`—a ⊗ 1– … a , p`—a ⊗ b– … 0if b 2 A j with j> 0, pr —1 ⊗ a– … a , and pr —a ⊗ b– … 0if a 2 A j with j> 0 . This is just the coproduct formula Ñ—a– … a ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ a ‡ P0<i<n a 0 i ⊗ a 00 n−i . (3) The diagram at the right commutes, where¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!AAA\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 AA\u0000 A\u0000 A\u0000 ¡¡¡¡¡! AA\u0000 A\u0000 A\u0000 AA\u0000 ƒ ƒƒ ¿ ¼ ¼¼ ˝—a ⊗ b ⊗ c ⊗ d– … —−1–ija ⊗ c ⊗ b ⊗ d for b 2 A i , c 2 A j . This is the condition that Ñ is an algebra homomorphism since if we follow an element a ⊗ b 2 Am ⊗ An across the top of the diagram we get Ñ—ab– , while the lower route gives ﬁrst Ñ—a– ⊗ Ñ—b– … (P i a0 i ⊗ a00 m−i\u0001 ⊗ (P j b0 j ⊗ b00 n−j\u0001 , then after applying ˝ and ˇ ⊗ ˇ this becomes P i;j—−1– —m−i–ja0 ib0 j ⊗ a00 m−ib00 n−j … (Pi a0 i ⊗ a 00 m−i\u0001(P j b0 j ⊗ b00 n−j\u0001 , which is Ñ—a–Ñ—b– . Condition (1) for A dualizes to (2) for A\u0003 , and similarly (2) for A dualizes to (1) for A\u0003 . Condition (3) for A dualizes to (3) for A \u0003 . tu Example 3C.11. Let us compute the dual of a polynomial algebra Rƒx⁄ . Suppose ﬁrst that x has even dimension. Then Ñ—xn– … —x ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ x– n … Pi \u0010n i \u0011xi ⊗ xn−i , so if \u000bi is dual to xi , the term \u0010 n i \u0011xi ⊗ xn−i in Ñ—xn– gives the product relation \u000bi\u000bn−i … \u0010n i \u0011\u000bn . This is the rule for multiplication in a divided polynomial algebra, so the dual of Rƒx⁄ is ÐRƒ\u000b⁄ if the dimension of x is even. This also holds if 2 … 0 in R , since the even-dimensionality of x was used only to deduce that Rƒx⁄ ⊗ Rƒx⁄ is strictly commutative. In case x is odd-dimensional, then as we saw in Example 3C.1, if we set y … x2 , we have Ñ—y n– … —y ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ y– n … P i \u0010n i \u0011y i ⊗ y n−i and Ñ—xy n– … Ñ—x–Ñ—y n– … Pi \u0010n i \u0011xy i ⊗ y n−i ‡Pi \u0010n i \u0011y i ⊗ xy n−i . These formulas for Ñ say that the dual of Rƒx⁄ is ÓRƒ\u000b⁄ ⊗ÐRƒ\f⁄ where \u000b is dual to x and \f is dual to y . This algebra allows us to deduce the cup product structure on H\u0003—J—S n–; R– from the geometric calculation H\u0003—J—S n–; R– ˇ Rƒx⁄ in Example 3C.7. As another applica- tion, recall from earlier in this section that RP1 and CP1 are H–spaces, so from their H–Spaces and Hopf Algebras Section 3.C 291 cup product structures we can conclude that the Pontryagin rings H\u0003—RP1; Z2– and H\u0003—CP1; Z– are divided polynomial algebras. In these examples the Hopf algebra is generated as an algebra by primitive ele- ments, so the product determines the coproduct and hence the dual algebra. This is not true in general, however. For example, we have seen that the Hopf algebra ÐZp ƒ\u000b⁄ is isomorphic as an algebra to Ni\u00150 Zpƒ\u000bpi ⁄=—\u000b p pi – , but if we regard the latter tensor product as the tensor product of the Hopf algebras Zpƒ\u000bpi ⁄=—\u000b p pi – then the elements \u000bpi are primitive, though they are not primitive in ÐZp ƒ\u000b⁄ for i> 0 . In fact, the Hopf algebra Ni\u00150 Zpƒ\u000bpi ⁄=—\u000b p pi – is its own dual, according to one of the exercises below, but the dual of ÐZp ƒ\u000b⁄ is Zpƒ\u000b⁄ . Exercises 1. Suppose that X is a CW complex with basepoint e 2 X a0 cell. Show that X is an H–space if there is a map \u0016 : X \u0002 X!X such that the maps X!X , x , \u0016—x; e– and x , \u0016—e; x– , are homotopic to the identity. [Sometimes this is taken as the deﬁnition of an H–space, rather than the more restrictive condition in the deﬁnition we have given.] With the same hypotheses, show also that \u0016 can be homotoped so that e is a strict two-sided identity. 2. Show that a retract of an H–space is an H–space if it contains the identity element. 3. Show that in a homotopy-associative H–space whose set of path-components is a group with respect to the multiplication induced by the H–space structure, all the path- components must be homotopy equivalent. [Homotopy-associative means associative up to homotopy.] 4. Show that an H–space or topological group structure on a path-connected, locally path-connected space can be lifted to such a structure on its universal cover.

Classify algebraically the Hopf algebras A over Z such that A n is free for each n and A ⊗ Q ˇ Qƒ\u000b⁄ . In particular, determine which Hopf algebras A ⊗ Zp arise from such A ’s. After the general discussion of homological and cohomological properties of H–spaces in the preceding section, we turn now to a family of quite interesting and subtle examples, the orthogonal groups O—n– . We will compute their homology and cohomology by constructing very nice CW structures on them, and the results illus- trate the general structure theorems of the last section quite well. After dealing with the orthogonal groups we then describe the straightforward generalization to Stiefel manifolds, which are also fairly basic objects in algebraic and geometric topology. The orthogonal group O—n– can be deﬁned as the group of isometries of R n ﬁxing the origin. Equivalently, this is the group of n\u0002 n matrices A with entries in R such that AA t … I , where At is the transpose of A . From this viewpoint, O—n– is topologized as a subspace of Rn2 , with coordinates the n 2 entries of an n\u0002 n matrix. Since the columns of a matrix in O—n– are unit vectors, O—n– can also be regarded as a subspace of the product of n copies of S n−1 . It is a closed subspace since the conditions that columns be orthogonal are deﬁned by polynomial equations. Hence The Cohomology of SO(n) Section 3.D 293 O—n– is compact. The map O—n–\u0002 O—n–!O—n– given by matrix multiplication is continuous since it is deﬁned by polynomials. The inversion map A , A −1 … A t is clearly continuous, so O—n– is a topological group, and in particular an H–space. The determinant map O—n–!f\u00061g is a surjective homomorphism, so its kernel SO—n– , the ‘special orthogonal group,’ is a subgroup of index two. The two cosets SO—n– and O—n– − SO—n– are homeomorphic to each other since for ﬁxed B 2 O—n– of determinant −1 , the maps A , AB and A , AB−1 are inverse homeomorphisms between these two cosets. The subgroup SO—n– is a union of components of O—n– since the image of the map O—n–!f\u00061g is discrete. In fact, SO—n– is path-connected since by linear algebra, each A 2 SO—n– is a rotation, a composition of rotations in a family of orthogonal 2 dimensional subspaces of R n , with the identity map on the subspace orthogonal to all these planes, and such a rotation can obviously be joined to the identity by a path of rotations of the same planes through decreasing angles. Another reason why SO—n– is connected is that it has a CW structure with a single 0 cell, as we show in Proposition 3D.1. An exercise at the end of the section is to show that a topological group with a CW structure is an orientable manifold, so SO—n– is a closed orientable manifold. From the CW structure it follows that its dimension is n—n − 1–=2 . These facts can also be proved using ﬁber bundles. The group O—n– is a subgroup of GLn—R– , the ‘general linear group’ of all invert- ible n\u0002 n matrices with entries in R , discussed near the beginning of x3.C. The Gram– Schmidt orthogonalization process applied to the columns of matrices in GLn—R– pro- vides a retraction r : GLn—R–!O—n– , continuity of r being evident from the explicit formulas for the Gram–Schmidt process. By inserting appropriate scalar factors into these formulas it is easy to see that O—n– is in fact a deformation retract of GLn—R– . Using a bit more linear algebra, namely the polar decomposition, it is possible to show that GLn—R– is actually homeomorphic to O—n–\u0002 R k for k … n—n ‡ 1–=2. The topological structure of SO—n– for small values of n can be described in terms of more familiar spaces: SO—1– is a point. SO—2– , the rotations of R 2 , is both homeomorphic and isomorphic as a group to S 1 , thought of as the unit complex numbers. SO—3– is homeomorphic to RP3 . To see this, let ' : D3!SO—3– send a nonzero vector x to the rotation through angle jxjˇ about the axis formed by the line through the origin in the direction of x . An orientation convention such as the ‘right-hand rule’ is needed to make this unambiguous. By continuity, ' then sends 0 to the identity. Antipodal points of S 2 … @D3 are sent to the same rotation through angle ˇ ,so ' induces a map ' : RP3!SO—3– , regarding RP3 as D3 with antipodal boundary points identiﬁed. The map ' is clearly injective since the axis of a nontrivial rotation is uniquely determined as its ﬁxed point set, and ' is surjective since by easy linear algebra each nonidentity element 294 Chapter 3 Cohomology of SO—3– is a rotation about some axis. It follows that ' is a homeomorphism RP3 ˇ SO—3– . SO—4– is homeomorphic to S 3 \u0002 SO—3– . Identifying R 4 with the quaternions H and S 3 with the group of unit quaternions, the quaternion multiplication v,vw for ﬁxed w 2 S 3 deﬁnes an isometry ˆw 2 O—4– since jvwj…jvjjwj…jvj if jwj… 1 . Points of O—4– are 4 tuples —v1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;v4– of orthonormal vectors vi 2 H … R 4 , and we view O—3– as the subspace with v1 … 1 . A homeomorphism S 3 \u0002 O—3–!O—4– is deﬁned by sending ( v; —1;v2;v3;v4–\u0001 to —v; v2v; v3v; v4v– … ˆv —1;v2;v3;v4– , with inverse —v; v2;v3;v4– , ( v; —1;v2v −1;v3v −1;v4v −1–\u0001 … ( v; ˆv −1 —v; v2;v3;v4–\u0001 . Restricting to identity components, we obtain a homeo- morphism S 3 \u0002 SO—3– ˇ SO—4– . This is not a group isomorphism, however. It can be shown, though we will not digress to do so here, that the homomorphism : S 3 \u0002 S 3!SO—4– sending a pair —u; v– of unit quaternions to the isometry w , uwv −1 of H is surjective with kernel Z2 …f\u0006—1; 1–g , and that is a covering space projection, representing S 3 \u0002 S 3 as a 2 sheeted cover of SO—4– , the universal cover. Restricting to the diagonal S 3 …f—u; u–gˆ S 3 \u0002 S 3 gives the universal cover S 3!SO—3– ,so SO—3– is isomorphic to the quotient group of S 3 by the normal subgroup f\u00061g . Using octonions one can construct in the same way a homeomorphism SO—8– ˇ S 7 \u0002 SO—7– . But in all other cases SO—n– is only a ‘twisted product’ of SO—n − 1– and S n−1 ; see Example 4.55 and the discussion following Corollary 4D.3. Cell Structure Our ﬁrst task is to construct a CW structure on SO—n– . This will come with a very nice cellular map ˆ : RPn−1 \u0002 RPn−2 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 RP1!SO—n– . To simplify notation we will write P i for RPi . To each nonzero vector v 2 Rn we can associate the reﬂection r—v– 2 O—n– across the hyperplane consisting of all vectors orthogonal to v . Since r—v– is a re- ﬂection, it has determinant −1 , so to get an element of SO—n– we consider the com- position ˆ—v– … r—v–r—e1– where e1 is the ﬁrst standard basis vector —1; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 0– . Since ˆ—v– depends only on the line spanned by v , ˆ deﬁnes a map P n−1!SO—n– . This map is injective since it is the composition of v ,r—v– , which is obviously an in- jection of P n−1 into O—n–−SO—n– , with the homeomorphism O—n–−SO—n–!SO—n– given by right-multiplication by r—e1– . Since ˆ is injective and P n−1 is compact Haus- dorff, we may think of ˆ as embedding P n−1 as a subspace of SO—n– . More generally, for a sequence I … —i1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;im– with each ij <n , we deﬁne a map ˆ : P I … P i1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 P im!SO—n– by letting ˆ—v1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vm– be the composition ˆ—v1– \u0001\u0001\u0001 ˆ—vm– .If 'i : Di!P i is the standard characteristic map for the i cell of P i , restricting to the 2 sheeted covering projection @Di!P i−1 , then the product 'I : DI!P I of the appropriate 'ij ’s is a characteristic map for the top-dimensional The Cohomology of SO(n) Section 3.D 295 cell of P I . We will be especially interested in the sequences I … —i1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;im– satisfying n>i1 > \u0001\u0001\u0001 >im > 0 . These sequences will be called admissible, as will the sequence consisting of a single 0 . Proposition 3D.1. The maps ˆ'I : DI!SO—n– , for I ranging over all admissible sequences, are the characteristic maps of a CW structure on SO—n– for which the map ˆ : P n−1 \u0002 P n−2 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 P 1!SO—n– is cellular. In particular, there is a single 0 cell e0 …f11g ,so SO—n– is path-connected. The other cells eI … ei1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 eim are products, via the group operation in SO—n– , of the cells ei ˆ P n−1 ˆ SO—n– . Proof: According to Proposition A.2 in the Appendix, there are three things to show in order to obtain the CW structure: (1) For each decreasing sequence I , ˆ'I is a homeomorphism from the interior of DI onto its image. (2) The resulting image cells eI are all disjoint and cover SO—n– . (3) For each eI , ˆ'I—@DI– is contained in a union of cells of lower dimension than eI . To begin the veriﬁcation of these properties, deﬁne p : SO—n–!S n−1 by evaluation at the vector en … —0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 0; 1– , p—\u000b– … \u000b—en– . Isometries in P n−2 ˆ P n−1 ˆ SO—n– ﬁx en ,so p—P n−2– …feng . We claim that p is a homeo- morphism from P n−1 − P n−2 onto S n−1 −feng . This can be v e n e n p(v)µ µ µ - seen as follows. Thinking of a point in P n−1 as a vector v , the map p takes this to ˆ—v–—en– … r—v–r—e1–—en– , which equals r —v–—en– since en is in the hyperplane orthogonal to e1 . From the picture at the right it is then clear that p simply stretches the lower half of each meridian circle in S n−1 onto the whole meridian circle, doubling the angle up from the south pole, so P n−1 − P n−2 , represented by vectors whose last coordinate is negative, is taken homeomorphically onto S n−1 −feng . The next statement is that the map h : ( P n−1 \u0002 SO—n − 1–; P n−2 \u0002 SO—n − 1–\u0001! ( SO—n–; SO—n − 1–\u0001 ; h—v; \u000b– … ˆ—v–\u000b is a homeomorphism from —P n−1 − P n−2–\u0002 SO—n − 1– onto SO—n– − SO—n − 1– . Here we view SO—n − 1– as the subgroup of SO—n– ﬁxing the vector en . To construct an inverse to this homeomorphism, let \f 2 SO—n– − SO—n − 1– be given. Then \f—en– ﬂ en so by the preceding paragraph there is a unique v\f 2 P n−1 − P n−2 with ˆ—v\f–—en– … \f—en– , and v\f depends continuously on \f since \f—en– does. The com- position \u000b\f … ˆ—v\f–−1\f then ﬁxes en , hence lies in SO—n − 1– . Since ˆ—v\f–\u000b\f … \f , the map \f , —v\f;\u000b\f– is an inverse to h on SO—n– − SO—n − 1– . Statements (1) and (2) can now be proved by induction on n . The map ˆ takes P n−2 to SO—n − 1– , so we may assume inductively that the maps ˆ'I for I ranging 296 Chapter 3 Cohomology over admissible sequences with ﬁrst term i1 <n − 1 are the characteristic maps for a CW structure on SO—n − 1– , with cells the corresponding products eI . The admissible sequences I with i1 … n − 1 then give disjoint cells eI covering SO—n– − SO—n − 1– by what was shown in the previous paragraph. So (1) and (2) hold for SO—n– . To prove (3) it sufﬁces to show there is an inclusion P iP i ˆ P iP i−1 in SO—n– since for an admissible sequence I , the map ˆ : P I!SO—n– takes the boundary of the top-dimensional cell of P I to the image of products P J with J obtained from I by decreasing one term ij by 1 , yielding a sequence which is admissible except perhaps for having two successive terms equal. As a preliminary to showing that P iP i ˆ P iP i−1 , observe that for \u000b 2 O—n– we have r ( \u000b—v– \u0001 … \u000br —v–\u000b −1 . Hence ˆ—v–ˆ—w– … r—v–r—e1–r —w–r —e1– … r—v–r—w 0– where w 0 … r—e1–w . Thus to show P iP i ˆ P iP i−1 it sufﬁces to ﬁnd for each pair v; w 2 R i‡1 a pair x 2 Ri‡1 , y 2 Ri with r—v–r—w– … r—x–r—y– . Let V ˆ R i‡1 be a 2 dimensional subspace containing v and w . Since V \\ R i is at least 1 dimensional, we can choose a unit vector y 2 V \\ R i . Let \u000b 2 O—i ‡ 1– take V to R2 and y to e1 . Then the conjugate \u000br —v–r —w–\u000b −1 … r ( \u000b—v– \u0001 r ( \u000b—w– \u0001 lies in SO—2– , hence has the form ˆ—z– … r—z–r—e1– for some z 2 R 2 by statement (2) for n … 2 . Therefore r—v–r—w– … \u000b−1r—z–r—e1–\u000b … r ( \u000b −1—z– \u0001 r ( \u000b −1—e1–\u0001 … r—x–r—y– for x … \u000b−1—z– 2 R i‡1 and y 2 R i . It remains to show that the map ˆ : P n−1 \u0002 P n−2 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 P 1!SO—n– is cellular. This follows from the inclusions P iP i ˆ P iP i−1 derived above, together with another family of inclusions P iP j ˆ P jP i for i<j . To prove the latter we have the formulas ˆ—v–ˆ—w– … r—v–r—w 0– where w 0 … r—e1–w; as earlier … r—v–r—w 0–r —v–r —v– … r ( r—v–w 0\u0001 r—v– from r ( \u000b—v– \u0001 … \u000br —v–\u000b −1 … r ( r—v–r—e1–w\u0001 r—v– … r ( ˆ—v–w\u0001 r—v– … ˆ( ˆ—v–w\u0001 ˆ—v 0– where v 0 … r—e1–v; hence v … r—e1–v 0 In particular, taking v 2 R i‡1 and w 2 R j‡1 with i<j , we have ˆ—v–w 2 R j‡1 , and the product ˆ—v–ˆ—w– 2 P iP j equals the product ˆ( ˆ—v–w\u0001 ˆ—v 0– 2 P jP i . tu Mod 2 Homology and Cohomology Each cell of SO—n– is the homeomorphic image of a cell in P n−1 \u0002 P n−2 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 P 1 , so the cellular chain map induced by ˆ : P n−1 \u0002 P n−2 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 P 1!SO—n– is surjective. It follows that with Z2 coefﬁcients the cellular boundary maps for SO—n– are all trivial since this is true in P i and hence in P n−1 \u0002 P n−2 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 P 1 by Proposition 3B.1. Thus H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– has a Z2 summand for each cell of SO—n– . One can rephrase this The Cohomology of SO(n) Section 3.D 297 as saying that there are isomorphisms Hi—SO—n–; Z2– ˇ Hi—S n−1 \u0002 S n−2 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 S 1; Z2– for all i since this product of spheres also has cells in one-to-one correspondence with admissible sequences. The full structure of the Z2 homology and cohomology rings is given by: Theorem 3D.2. (a) H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– ˇ N i odd Z2ƒ\fi⁄=—\f pi i – where j\fij… i and pi is the smallest power of 2 such that j\fpi i j\u0015 n . (b) The Pontryagin ring H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– is the exterior algebra ÓZ2 ƒe1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;en−1⁄ . Here ei denotes the cellular homology class of the cell ei ˆ P n−1 ˆ SO—n– , and \fi is the dual class to ei , represented by the cellular cochain assigning the value 1 to the cell ei and 0 to all other i cells. Proof: As we noted above, ˆ induces a surjection on cellular chains. Since the cellular boundary maps with Z2 coefﬁcients are trivial for both P n−1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 P 1 and SO—n– , it follows that ˆ\u0003 is surjective on H\u0003—−; Z2– and ˆ\u0003 is injective on H\u0003—−; Z2– .We know that H\u0003—P n−1 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 P 1; Z2– is the polynomial ring Z2ƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn−1⁄ truncated by the relations \u000bi‡1 i … 0 . For \fi 2 Hi—SO—n–; Z2– the dual class to ei , we have ˆ\u0003—\fi– … Pj \u000b i j , the class assigning 1 to each i cell in a factor P j of P n−1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 P 1 and 0 to all other i cells, which are products of lower-dimensional cells and hence map to cells in SO—n– disjoint from ei . First we will show that the monomials \fI … \fi1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \fim corresponding to admissi- ble sequences I are linearly independent in H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– , hence are a vector space basis. Since ˆ\u0003 is injective, we may identify each \fi with its image P j \u000b i j in the trun- cated polynomial ring Z2ƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn−1⁄=—\u000b 2 1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000b n n−1– . Suppose we have a linear relation PI bI\fI … 0 with bI 2 Z2 and I ranging over the admissible sequences. Since each \fI is a product of distinct \fi ’s, we can write the relation in the form x\f1 ‡ y … 0 where neither x nor y has \f1 as a factor. Since \u000b1 occurs only in the term \f1 of x\f1 ‡ y , where it has exponent 1 , we have x\f1 ‡ y … x\u000b1 ‡ z where neither x nor z involves \u000b1 . The relation x\u000b1 ‡ z … 0in Z2ƒ\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000bn−1⁄=—\u000b 2 1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000b n n−1– then implies x … 0 . Thus we may assume the original relation does not involve \f1 . Now we repeat the argument for \f2 . Write the relation in the form x\f2 ‡ y … 0 where neither x nor y involves \f2 or \f1 . The variable \u000b2 now occurs only in the term \f2 of x\f2 ‡ y , where it has exponent 2 , so we have x\f2 ‡ y … x\u000b 2 2 ‡ z where x and z do not involve \u000b1 or \u000b2 . Then x\u000b 2 2 ‡ z … 0 implies x … 0 and we have a relation involving neither \f1 nor \f2 . Continuing inductively, we eventually deduce that all coefﬁcients bI in the original relation P I bI\fI … 0 must be zero. Observe now that \f 2 i … \f2i if 2i<n and \f 2 i … 0if2i \u0015 n , since (P j \u000bi j\u00012 … Pj \u000b 2i j . The quotient Q of the algebra Z2ƒ\f1;\f2; \u0001\u0001\u0001⁄ by the relations \f 2 i … \f2i and \fj … 0 for j \u0015 n then maps onto H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– . This map Q!H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– is also injective since the relations deﬁning Q allow every element of Q to be rep- resented as a linear combination of admissible monomials \fI , and the admissible 298 Chapter 3 Cohomology monomials are linearly independent in H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– . The algebra Q can also be described as the tensor product in statement (a) of the theorem since the relations \f2 i … \f2i allow admissible monomials to be written uniquely as monomials in powers of the \fi ’s with i odd, and the relation \fj … 0 for j \u0015 n becomes \fipi … \f pi i … 0 where j … ipi with i odd and pi a power of 2 . For a given i , this relation holds iff ipi \u0015 n , or in other words, iff j\f pi i j\u0015 n . This ﬁnishes the proof of (a). For part (b), note ﬁrst that the group multiplication SO—n–\u0002 SO—n–!SO—n– is cellular in view of the inclusions P iP i ˆ P iP i−1 and P iP j ˆ P jP i for i<j .So we can compute Pontryagin products at the cellular level. We know that there is at least an additive isomorphism H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– ˇ ÓZ2 ƒe1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;en−1⁄ since the products eI … ei1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 eim with I admissible form a basis for H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– . The inclusion P iP i ˆ P iP i−1 then implies that the Pontryagin product —ei– 2 is 0 . It remains only to see the commutativity relation eiej … ejei . The inclusion P iP j ˆ P jP i for i<j was obtained from the formula ˆ—v–ˆ—w– … ˆ—ˆ—v–w–ˆ—v 0– for v 2 R i‡1 , w 2 Rj‡1 , and v 0 … r—e1–v . The map f : P i \u0002 P j!P j \u0002 P i , f—v; w– … —ˆ—v–w; v 0– , is a homeo- morphism since it is the composition of homeomorphisms —v; w– , —v; ˆ—v–w– , —v 0; ˆ—v–w– , —ˆ—v–w; v 0– . The ﬁrst of these maps takes ei \u0002 ej homeomorphically onto itself since ˆ—v–—ej– … ej if i<j . Obviously the second map also takes ei \u0002 ej homeomorphically onto itself, while the third map simply transposes the two fac- tors. Thus f restricts to a homeomorphism from ei \u0002 ej onto ej \u0002 ei , and therefore eiej … ejei in H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– . tu The cup product and Pontryagin product structures in this theorem may seem at ﬁrst glance to be unrelated, but in fact the relationship is fairly direct. As we saw in the previous section, the dual of a polynomial algebra Z2ƒx⁄ is a divided polynomial alge- bra ÐZ2 ƒ\u000b⁄ , and with Z2 coefﬁcients the latter is an exterior algebra ÓZ2 ƒ\u000b0;\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001⁄ where j\u000bij… 2 ijxj . If we truncate the polynomial algebra by a relation x2n … 0, then this just eliminates the generators \u000bi for i \u0015 n . In view of this, if it were the case that the generators \fi for the algebra H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– happened to be primitive, then H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– would be isomorphic as a Hopf algebra to the tensor product of the single-generator Hopf algebras Z2ƒ\fi⁄=—\f pi i – , i … 1; 3; \u0001\u0001\u0001 , hence the dual algebra H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– would be the tensor product of the corresponding truncated divided polynomial algebras, in other words an exterior algebra as just explained. This is in fact the structure of H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– , so since the Pontryagin product in H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– determines the coproduct in H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– uniquely, it follows that the \fi ’s must indeed be primitive. It is not difﬁcult to give a direct argument that each \fi is primitive. The coprod- uct Ñ : H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2–!H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– ⊗ H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– is induced by the group mul- tiplication \u0016 : SO—n–\u0002 SO—n–!SO—n– . We need to show that the value of Ñ—\fi– on eI ⊗ eJ , which we denote hÑ—\fi–; eI ⊗ eJ i , is the same as the value h\fi ⊗ 1‡1 ⊗ \fi;eI ⊗ eJ i The Cohomology of SO(n) Section 3.D 299 for all cells eI and eJ whose dimensions add up to i . Since Ñ … \u0016\u0003 , we have hÑ—\fi–; eI ⊗ eJ i…h\fi;\u0016\u0003—eI ⊗ eJ –i . Because \u0016 is the multiplication map, \u0016—eI \u0002 eJ – is contained in P IP J , and if we use the relations P jP j ˆ P jP j−1 and P jP k ˆ P kP j for j< k to rearrange the factors P j of P IP J so that their dimensions are in decreasing order, then the only way we will end up with a term P i is if we start with P IP J equal to P iP 0 or P 0P i . Thus h\fi;\u0016\u0003—eI ⊗ eJ –i… 0 unless eI ⊗ eJ equals ei ⊗ e0 or e0 ⊗ ei . Hence Ñ—\fi– contains no other terms besides \fi ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \fi , and \fi is primitive. Integer Homology and Cohomology With Z coefﬁcients the homology and cohomology of SO—n– turns out to be a good bit more complicated than with Z2 coefﬁcients. One can see a little of this complexity already for small values of n , where the homeomorphisms SO—3– ˇ RP3 and SO—4– ˇ S 3 \u0002 RP3 would allow one to compute the additive structure as a direct sum of a certain number of Z ’s and Z2 ’s. For larger values of n the additive structure is qualitatively the same: Proposition 3D.3. H\u0003—SO—n–; Z– is a direct sum of Z ’s and Z2 ’s. Proof: We compute the cellular chain complex of SO—n– , showing that it splits as a tensor product of simpler complexes. For a cell ei ˆ P n−1 ˆ SO—n– the cellular bound- ary dei is 2ei−1 for even i> 0 and 0 for odd i . To compute the cellular boundary of a cell ei1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 eim we can pull it back to a cell ei1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 eim of P n−1 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 P 1 whose cellular boundary, by Proposition 3B.1, is Pj—−1– ˙j ei1 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 deij \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 eim where ˙j … i1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ ij−1 . Hence d—ei1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 eim – … P j—−1– ˙j ei1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 deij \u0001\u0001\u0001 eim , where it is un- derstood that ei1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 deij \u0001\u0001\u0001 eim is zero if ij … ij‡1 ‡ 1 since P ij −1P ij −1 ˆ P ij −1P ij −2 , in a lower-dimensional skeleton. To split the cellular chain complex C\u0003( SO—n– \u0001 as a tensor product of smaller chain complexes, let C 2i be the subcomplex of C\u0003( SO—n– \u0001 with basis the cells e0 , e2i , e2i−1 , and e2ie2i−1 . This is a subcomplex since de2i−1 … 0, de2i … 2e2i−1 , and, in P 2i \u0002 P 2i−1 , d—e2i \u0002 e2i−1– … de2i \u0002 e2i−1 ‡ e2i \u0002 de2i−1 … 2e2i−1 \u0002 e2i−1 , hence d—e2ie2i−1– … 0 since P 2i−1P 2i−1 ˆ P 2i−1P 2i−2 . The claim is that there are chain complex isomorphisms C\u0003( SO—2k ‡ 1–\u0001 ˇ C 2⊗C 4⊗ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ⊗C 2k C\u0003( SO—2k ‡ 2–\u0001 ˇ C 2⊗C 4⊗ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ⊗C 2k⊗C 2k‡1 where C 2k‡1 has basis e0 and e2k‡1 . Certainly these isomorphisms hold for the chain groups themselves, so it is only a matter of checking that the boundary maps agree. For the case of C\u0003( SO—2k ‡ 1–\u0001 this can be seen by induction on k , as the reader can easily verify. Then the case of C\u0003( SO—2k ‡ 2–\u0001 reduces to the ﬁrst case by a similar argument. Since H\u0003—C 2i– consists of Z ’s in dimensions 0 and 4i − 1 and a Z2 in dimension 2i − 1 , while H\u0003—C 2k‡1– consists of Z ’s in dimensions 0 and 2k ‡ 1 , we conclude 300 Chapter 3 Cohomology from the algebraic K¨unneth formula that H\u0003—SO—n–; Z– is a direct sum of Z ’s and Z2 ’s. tu Note that the calculation shows that SO—2k– and SO—2k − 1–\u0002 S 2k−1 have iso- morphic homology groups in all dimensions. In view of the preceding proposition, one can get rather complete information about H\u0003—SO—n–; Z– by considering the natural maps to H\u0003—SO—n–; Z2– and to the quotient of H\u0003—SO—n–; Z– by its torsion subgroup. Let us denote this quotient by Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—n–; Z– . The same strategy applies equally well to cohomology, and the uni- versal coefﬁcient theorem gives an isomorphism H\u0003 fr ee—SO—n–; Z– ˇ Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—n–; Z– . The proof of the proposition shows that the additive structure of Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—n–; Z– is fairly simple: Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—2k ‡ 1–; Z– ˇ H\u0003—S 3 \u0002 S 7 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 S 4k−1– Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—2k ‡ 2–; Z– ˇ H\u0003—S 3 \u0002 S 7 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 S 4k−1 \u0002 S 2k‡1– The multiplicative structure is also as simple as it could be: Proposition 3D.4. The Pontryagin ring Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—n–; Z– is an exterior algebra, Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—2k ‡ 1–; Z– ˇ ÓZƒa3;a7; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;a4k−1⁄ where jaij… i Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—2k ‡ 2–; Z– ˇ ÓZƒa3;a7; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;a4k−1;a2k‡1⁄ The generators ai are primitive, so the dual Hopf algebra H\u0003 fr ee—SO—n–; Z– is an exterior algebra on the dual generators \u000bi . Proof: As in the case of Z2 coefﬁcients we can work at the level of cellular chains since the multiplication in SO—n– is cellular. Consider ﬁrst the case n … 2k ‡ 1. Let Ei be the cycle e2ie2i−1 generating a Z summand of H\u0003—SO—n–; Z– . By what we have shown above, the products Ei1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 Eim with i1 > \u0001\u0001\u0001 >im form an additive basis for Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—n–; Z– , so we need only verify that the multiplication is as in an exterior algebra on the classes Ei . The map f in the proof of Proposition 3D.2 gives a homeomorphism ei \u0002 ej ˇ ej \u0002 ei if i<j , and this homeomorphism has local degree —−1–ij‡1 since it is the composition —v; w– , —v; ˆ—v–w– , —v 0; ˆ—v–w– , —ˆ—v–w; v 0– of homeomorphisms with local degrees ‡1; −1 , and —−1– ij . Applying this four times to commute EiEj … e2ie2i−1e2je2j−1 to EjEi … e2je2j−1e2ie2i−1 , three of the four applications give a sign of −1 and the fourth gives a ‡1 , so we conclude that EiEj …−EjEi if i<j . When i … j we have —Ei– 2 … 0 since e2ie2i−1e2ie2i−1 … e2ie2ie2i−1e2i−1 , which lies in a lower-dimensional skeleton because of the relation P 2iP 2i ˆ P 2iP 2i−1 . Thus we have shown that H\u0003—SO—2k ‡ 1–; Z– contains ÓZƒE1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;Ek⁄ as a sub- algebra. The same reasoning shows that H\u0003—SO—2k ‡ 2–; Z– contains the subalgebra ÓZƒE1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;Ek;e2k‡1⁄ . These exterior subalgebras account for all the nontorsion in H\u0003—SO—n–; Z– , so the product structure in Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—n–; Z– is as stated. The Cohomology of SO(n) Section 3.D 301 Now we show that the generators Ei and e2k‡1 are primitive in Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—n–; Z– . Looking at the formula for the boundary maps in the cellular chain complex of SO—n– , we see that this chain complex is the direct sum of the subcomplexes C—m– with basis the m fold products ei1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 eim with i1 > \u0001\u0001\u0001 >im > 0 . We allow m … 0 here, with C—0– having basis the 0 cell of SO—n– . The direct sum C—0–\b \u0001\u0001\u0001 \b C—m– is the cellular chain complex of the subcomplex of SO—n– consisting of cells that are products of m or fewer cells ei . In particular, taking m … 2 we have a subcomplex X ˆ SO—n– whose homology, mod torsion, consists of the Z in dimension zero and the Z ’s generated by the cells Ei , together with the cell e2k‡1 when n … 2k ‡ 2 . The inclusion X > SO—n– induces a commutative diagram¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!XH free();Z¤ XH free();Z¤ XH free();Z¤\u0000 ¡¡¡¡¡!SOHn free( ( ));Z¤ SOHn free( ( ));Z¤ SOHn free( ( ));Z¤\u0000 ƒ ƒ where the lower Ñ is the coproduct in Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—n–; Z– and the upper Ñ is its ana- log for X , coming from the diagonal map X!X \u0002 X and the K¨unneth formula. The classes Ei in the lower left group pull back to elements we label eEi in the upper left group. Since these have odd dimension and Hfr ee \u0003 —X; Z– vanishes in even positive dimensions, the images Ñ— eEi– can have no components a ⊗ b with both a and b positive-dimensional. The same is therefore true for Ñ—Ei– by commutativity of the diagram, so the classes Ei are primitive. This argument also works for e2k‡1 when n … 2k ‡ 2. Since the exterior algebra generators of Hfr ee \u0003 —SO—n–; Z– are primitive, this alge- bra splits as a Hopf algebra into a tensor product of single-generator exterior algebras ÓZƒai⁄ . The dual Hopf algebra H\u0003 fr ee—SO—n–; Z– therefore splits as the tensor prod- uct of the dual exterior algebras ÓZƒ\u000bi⁄ , hence H\u0003 fr ee—SO—n–; Z– is also an exterior algebra. tu The exact ring structure of H\u0003—SO—n–; Z– can be deduced from these results via Bockstein homomorphisms, as we show in Example 3E.7, though the process is somewhat laborious and the answer not very neat. Stiefel Manifolds Consider the Stiefel manifold Vn;k , whose points are the orthonormal k frames in Rn , that is, orthonormal k tuples of vectors. Thus Vn;k is a subset of the product of k copies of S n−1 , and it is given the subspace topology. As special cases, Vn;n … O—n– and Vn;1 … S n−1 . Also, Vn;2 can be identiﬁed with the space of unit tangent vectors to S n−1 since a vector v at the point x 2 S n−1 is tangent to S n−1 iff it is orthogonal to x . We can also identify Vn;n−1 with SO—n– since there is a unique way of extending an orthonormal —n − 1– frame to a positively oriented orthonormal n frame. 302 Chapter 3 Cohomology There is a natural projection p : O—n–!Vn;k sending \u000b 2 O—n– to the k frame consisting of the last k columns of \u000b , which are the images under \u000b of the last k standard basis vectors in Rn . This projection is onto, and the preimages of points are precisely the cosets \u000bO—n − k– , where we embed O—n − k– in O—n– as the orthogonal transformations of the ﬁrst n − k coordinates of R n . Thus Vn;k can be viewed as the space O—n–=O—n − k– of such cosets, with the quotient topology from O—n– . This is the same as the previously deﬁned topology on Vn;k since the projection O—n–!Vn;k is a surjection of compact Hausdorff spaces. When k<n the projection p : SO—n–!Vn;k is surjective, and Vn;k can also be viewed as the coset space SO—n–=SO—n−k– . We can use this to induce a CW structure on Vn;k from the CW structure on SO—n– . The cells are the sets of cosets of the form eISO—n − k– … ei1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 eim SO—n − k– for n>i1 > \u0001\u0001\u0001 >im \u0015 n − k , together with the coset SO—n − k– itself as a 0 cell of Vn;k . These sets of cosets are unions of cells of SO—n– since SO—n−k– consists of the cells eJ … ej1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 ej` with n−k>j1 > \u0001\u0001\u0001 >j` . This implies that Vn;k is the disjoint union of its cells, and the boundary of each cell is contained in cells of lower dimension, so we do have a CW structure. Since the projection SO—n–!Vn;k is a cellular map, the structure of the cellular chain complex of Vn;k can easily be deduced from that of SO—n– . For example, the cellular chain complex of V2k‡1;2 is just the complex C 2k deﬁned earlier, while for V2k;2 the cellular boundary maps are all trivial. Hence the nonzero homology groups of Vn;2 are Hi—V2k‡1;2; Z– … ˆ Z for i … 0; 4k − 1 Z2 for i … 2k − 1 Hi—V2k;2; Z– … Z for i … 0; 2k − 2; 2k − 1; 4k − 3 Thus SO—n– has the same homology and cohomology groups as the product space V3;2 \u0002 V5;2 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 V2k‡1;2 when n … 2k‡1 , or as V3;2 \u0002 V5;2 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 V2k‡1;2 \u0002 S 2k‡1 when n … 2k ‡ 2 . However, our calculations show that SO—n– is distinguished from these products by its cup product structure with Z2 coefﬁcients, at least when n \u0015 5 , since \f4 1 is nonzero in H4—SO—n–; Z2– if n \u0015 5 , while for the product spaces the nontrivial element of H1—−; Z2– must lie in the factor V3;2 , and H4—V3;2; Z2– … 0 . When n … 4 we have SO—4– homeomorphic to SO—3–\u0002 S 3 … V3;2 \u0002 S 3 as we noted at the beginning of this section. Also SO—3– … V3;2 and SO—2– … S 1 . Exercises 1.

Compute the Pontryagin ring structure in H\u0003—SO—5–; Z– . Bockstein Homomorphisms Section 3.E 303 Homology and cohomology with coefﬁcients in a ﬁeld, particularly Zp with p prime, often have more structure and are easier to compute than with Z coefﬁcients. Of course, passing from Z to Zp coefﬁcients can involve a certain loss of information, a blurring of ﬁner distinctions. For example, a Zpn in integer homology becomes a pair of Zp ’s in Zp homology or cohomology, so the exponent n is lost with Zp coefﬁcients. In this section we introduce Bockstein homomorphisms, which in many interesting cases allow one to recover Z coefﬁcient information from Zp coefﬁcients. Bockstein homomorphisms also provide a small piece of extra internal structure to Zp homology or cohomology itself, which can be quite useful. We will concentrate on cohomology in order to have cup products available, but the basic constructions work equally well for homology. If we take a short ex- act sequence 0!G!H!K!0 of abelian groups and apply the covariant functor Hom—Cn—X–; −– , we obtain 0 -! C n—X; G– -! C n—X; H– -! C n—X; K– -! 0 which is exact since Cn—X– is free. Letting n vary, we have a short exact sequence of chain complexes, so there is an associated long exact sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Hn—X; G– -! Hn—X; H– -! Hn—X; K– -! Hn‡1—X; G– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 whose ‘boundary’ map Hn—X; K–!Hn‡1—X; G– is called a Bockstein homomorphism. We shall be interested primarily in the Bockstein \f : Hn—X; Zm–!Hn‡1—X; Zm– as- sociated to the coefﬁcient sequence 0!Zm m-----! Zm2 -! Zm!0 , especially when m is prime, but for the moment we do not need this assumption. Closely related to \f is the Bockstein e\f : Hn—X; Zm–!Hn‡1—X; Z– associated to 0!Z m-----! Z -! Zm!0 . From the natural map of the latter short exact sequence onto the former one, we obtain the re- lationship \f … ˆ e\f where ˆ : H\u0003—X; Z–!H\u0003—X; Zm– is the homomorphism induced by the map Z!Zm reducing coefﬁcients mod m . Thus we have a commutative triangle in the following diagram, whose upper row is the exact sequence containing e\f . ¡¡¡¡¡!XH m n(); ¯ ¯ Z¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! XH (); Z » ½ ¡¡¡¡¡!XH n(); Z m m Z ½ n 1+ XH (); Z n 1+ XH (); n 1+ Example 3E.1. Let X be a K—Zm; 1– , for example RP1 when m … 2 or an inﬁnite- dimensional lens space with fundamental group Zm for arbitrary m . From the ho- mology calculations in Examples 2.42 and 2.43 together with the universal coefﬁcient theorem or cellular cohomology we have Hn—X; Zm– ˇ Zm for all n . Let us show that \f : Hn—X; Zm–!Hn‡1—X; Zm– is an isomorphism for n odd and zero for n even. If n is odd the vertical map ˆ in the diagram above is surjective for X … K—Zm; 1– ,as 304 Chapter 3 Cohomology is e\f since the map m is trivial, so \f is surjective, hence an isomorphism. On the other hand, when n is even the ﬁrst map ˆ in the diagram is surjective, so e\f … 0by exactness, hence \f … 0. A useful fact about \f is that it satisﬁes the derivation property —\u0003– \f—a ` b– … \f—a– ` b ‡ —−1–jaja ` \f—b– which comes from the corresponding formula for ordinary coboundary. Namely, let ' and be Zm cocycles representing a and b , and let e' and e be lifts of these to Zm2 cochains. Concretely, one can view ' and as functions on singular simplices with values in f0; 1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;m − 1g , and then e' and e can be taken to be the same functions, but with f0; 1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;m − 1g regarded as a subset of Zm2 . Then \u000e e' … m\u0011 and \u000e e … m\u0016 for Zp cocycles \u0011 and \u0016 representing \f—a– and \f—b– . Taking cup products, e' ` e is a Zm2 cochain lifting the Zm cocycle ' ` , and \u000e— e' ` e – … \u000e e' ` e \u0006 e' ` \u000e e … m\u0011 ` e \u0006 e' ` m\u0016 … m( \u0011 ` \u0006 ' ` \u0016\u0001 where the sign \u0006 is —−1–jaj . Hence \u0011 ` ‡ —−1– jaj' ` \u0016 represents \f—a ` b– , giving the formula —\u0003– . Example 3E.2: Cup Products in Lens Spaces. The cup product structure for lens spaces was computed in Example 3.41 via Poincar´e duality, but using Bocksteins we can deduce it from the cup product structure in CP1 , which was computed in Theo- rem 3.12 without Poincar´e duality. Consider ﬁrst the inﬁnite-dimensional lens space L … S 1=Zm where Zm acts on the unit sphere S 1 in C1 by scalar multiplication, so the action is generated by the rotation v , e2ˇ i=mv . The quotient map S 1!CP1 factors through L , so we have a projection L!CP1 . Looking at the cell structure on L described in Example 2.43, we see that each even-dimensional cell of L projects homeomorphically onto the corresponding cell of CP1 . Namely, the 2n cell of L is the homeomorphic image of the 2n cell in S 2n‡1 ˆ Cn‡1 formed by the points cos \u0012—z1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn; 0– ‡ sin \u0012—0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 0; 1– with P i z2 i … 1 and 0 <\u0012 \u0014 ˇ , and the same is true for the 2n cell of CP1 . From cellular cohomology it then follows that the map L!CP1 induces isomorphisms on even-dimensional cohomology with Zm co- efﬁcients. Since H\u0003—CP1; Zm– is a polynomial ring, we deduce that if y 2 H2—L; Zm– is a generator, then y k generates H2k—L; Zm– for all k . By Example 3E.1 there is a generator x 2 H1—L; Zm– with \f—x– … y . The prod- uct formula —\u0003– gives \f—xy k– … \f—x–y k − x\f—y k– … y k‡1 . Thus \f takes xy k to a generator, hence xy k must be a generator of H2k‡1—L; Zm– . This completely determines the cup product structure in H\u0003—L; Zm– if m is odd since the commu- tativity property of cup product implies that x2 … 0 in this case. The result is that H\u0003—L; Zm– ˇ ÓZm ƒx⁄ ⊗ Zmƒy⁄ for odd m . When m is even this statement needs to be modiﬁed slightly by inserting the relation that x2 is the unique element of order Bockstein Homomorphisms Section 3.E 305 2in H2—L; Zm– ˇ Zm , as we showed in Example 3.9 by an explicit calculation in the 2 skeleton of L . The cup product structure in ﬁnite-dimensional lens spaces follows from this since a ﬁnite-dimensional lens space embeds as a skeleton in an inﬁnite-dimensional lens space, and the homotopy type of an inﬁnite-dimensional lens space is determined by its fundamental group since it is a K—ˇ ; 1– . It follows that the cup product struc- ture on a lens space S 2n‡1=Zm with Zm coefﬁcients is obtained from the preceding calculation by truncating via the relation y n‡1 … 0. The relation \f … ˆ e\f implies that \f2 … ˆ e\fˆ e\f … 0 since e\fˆ … 0 in the long exact sequence containing e\f . Because \f2 … 0 , the groups Hn—X; Zm– form a chain complex with the Bockstein homomorphisms \f as the ‘boundary’ maps. We can then form the associated Bockstein cohomology groups Ker \f= Im \f , which we denote BHn—X; Zm– in dimension n . The most interesting case is when m is a prime p , so we shall assume this from now on. Proposition 3E.3. If Hn—X; Z– is ﬁnitely generated for all n , then the Bockstein co- homology groups BHn—X; Zp– are determined by the following rules : (a) Each Z summand of Hn—X; Z– contributes a Zp summand to BHn—X; Zp– . (b) Each Zpk summand of Hn—X; Z– with k> 1 contributes Zp summands to both BHn−1—X; Zp– and BHn—X; Zp– . (c) A Zp summand of Hn—X; Z– gives Zp summands of Hn−1—X; Zp– and Hn—X; Zp– with \f an isomorphism between these two summands, hence there is no contri- bution to BH\u0003—X; Zp– . Proof: We will use the algebraic notion of minimal chain complexes. Suppose that C is a chain complex of free abelian groups for which the homology groups Hn—C– are ﬁnitely generated for each n . Choose a splitting of each Hn—C– as a direct sum of cyclic groups. There are countably many of these cyclic groups, so we can list them as G1;G2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 . For each Gi choose a generator gi and deﬁne a corresponding chain complex M—gi– by the following prescription. If gi has inﬁnite order in Gi ˆ Hni —C– , let M—gi– consist of just a Z in dimension ni , with generator zi . On the other hand, if gi has ﬁnite order k in Hni —C– , let M—gi– consist of Z ’s in dimensions ni and ni ‡ 1, generated by xi and yi respectively, with @yi … kxi . Let M be the direct sum of the chain complexes M—gi– . Deﬁne a chain map ˙ : M!C by sending zi and xi to cycles \u0010i and ˘i representing the corresponding homology classes gi , and yi to a chain \u0011i with @\u0011i … k˘i . The chain map ˙ induces an isomorphism on homology, hence also on cohomology with any coefﬁcients, by Corollary 3.4. The dual cochain complex M \u0003 obtained by applying Hom—−; Z– splits as the direct sum of the dual complexes M \u0003—gi– . So in cohomology with Z coefﬁcients the dual basis element z\u0003 i generates a Z summand in dimension ni , while y \u0003 i generates a Zk summand in dimension ni ‡ 1 since \u000ex\u0003 i … ky \u0003 i . With Zp coefﬁcients, p prime, z\u0003 i gives a Zp summand of 306 Chapter 3 Cohomology Hni —M; Zp– , while x\u0003 i and y \u0003 i give Zp summands of Hni —M; Zp– and Hni‡1—M; Zp– if p divides k and otherwise they give nothing. The map ˙ induces an isomorphism between the associated Bockstein long exact sequences of cohomology groups, with commuting squares, so we can use M \u0003 to compute \f and e\f , and we can do the calculation separately on each summand M \u0003—gi– . Obviously \f and e\f are zero on y \u0003 i and z\u0003 i . When p divides k we have the class x\u0003 i 2 Hni —M; Zp– , and from the deﬁnition of Bockstein homomorphisms it follows that e\f—x\u0003 i – … —k=p–y \u0003 i 2 Hni‡1—M; Z– and \f—x\u0003 i – … —k=p–y \u0003 i 2 Hni‡1—M; Zp– . The latter element is nonzero iff k is not divisible by p2 . tu Corollary 3E.4. In the situation of the preceding proposition, H\u0003—X; Z– contains no elements of order p2 iff the dimension of BHn—X; Zp– as a vector space over Zp equals the rank of Hn—X; Z– for all n . In this case ˆ : H\u0003—X; Z–!H\u0003—X; Zp– is injec- tive on the p torsion, and the image of this p torsion under ˆ is equal to Im \f . Proof: The ﬁrst statement is evident from the proposition. The injectivity of ˆ on p torsion is in fact equivalent to there being no elements of order p2 . The equality Im ˆ … Im \f follows from the fact that Im \f … ˆ—Im e\f– … ˆ—Ker m– in the commutative diagram near the beginning of this section, and the fact that for m … p the kernel of m is exactly the p torsion when there are no elements of order p2 . tu Example 3E.5. Let us use Bocksteins to compute H\u0003—RP1 \u0002 RP1; Z– . This could in- stead be done by ﬁrst computing the homology via the general K¨unneth formula, then applying the universal coefﬁcient theorem, but with Bocksteins we will only need the simpler K¨unneth formula for ﬁeld coefﬁcients in Theorem 3.16. The cup product structure in H\u0003—RP1 \u0002 RP1; Z– will also be easy to determine via Bocksteins. For p an odd prime we have eH\u0003—RP1; Zp– … 0 , hence eH\u0003—RP1 \u0002 RP1; Zp– … 0by Theorem 3.16. The universal coefﬁcient theorem then implies that eH\u0003—RP1 \u0002 RP1; Z– consists entirely of elements of order a power of 2 . From Example 3E.1 we know that Bockstein homomorphisms in H\u0003—RP1; Z2– ˇ Z2ƒx⁄ are given by \f—x2k−1– … x2k and \f—x2k– … 0. In H\u0003—RP1 \u0002 RP1; Z2– ˇ Z2ƒx; y⁄ we can then compute \f via the product formula \f—xmy n– … —\fxm–y n ‡ xm—\fy n– . The answer can be represented graphically by the ﬁg- ure to the right. Here the dot, diamond, or circle xx1 1 y y 2 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 y 6 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 in the —m; n– position represents the monomial xmy n and line segments indicate nontrivial Bock- steins. For example, the lower left square records the formulas \f—xy– … x2y ‡ xy 2 , \f—x2y– … x2y 2 … \f—xy 2– , and \f—x2y 2– … 0 . Thus in this square we see that Ker \f … Im \f , with generators the ‘diagonal’ sum x2y ‡ xy 2 and x2y 2 . The Bockstein Homomorphisms Section 3.E 307 same thing happens in all the other squares, so it is apparent that Ker \f … Im \f ex- cept for the zero-dimensional class ‘ 1 .’ By the preceding corollary this says that all nontrivial elements of eH\u0003—RP1 \u0002 RP1; Z– have order 2 . Furthermore, Im \f consists of the subring Z2ƒx2;y 2⁄ , indicated by the circles in the ﬁgure, together with the multiples of x2y ‡ xy 2 by elements of Z2ƒx2;y 2⁄ . It follows that there is a ring isomorphism H\u0003—RP1 \u0002 RP1; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u0015; \u0016; \u0017⁄=—2\u0015; 2\u0016; 2\u0017; \u0017 2 ‡ \u00152\u0016 ‡ \u0015\u00162– where ˆ—\u0015– … x2 , ˆ—\u0016– … y 2 , ˆ—\u0017– … x2y ‡ xy 2 , and the relation \u0017 2 ‡ \u0015 2\u0016 ‡ \u0015\u00162 … 0 holds since —x2y ‡ xy 2– 2 … x4y 2 ‡ x2y 4 . This calculation illustrates the general principle that cup product structures with Z coefﬁcients tend to be considerably more complicated than with ﬁeld coefﬁcients. One can see even more striking evidence of this by computing H\u0003—RP1 \u0002 RP1 \u0002 RP1; Z– by the same technique. Example 3E.6. Let us construct ﬁnite CW complexes X1 , X2; and Y such that the rings H\u0003—X1; Z– and H\u0003—X2; Z– are isomorphic but H\u0003—X1 \u0002 Y ; Z– and H\u0003—X2 \u0002 Y ; Z– are isomorphic only as groups, not as rings. According to Theorem 3.16 this can happen only if all three of X1 , X2 , and Y have torsion in their Z cohomology. The space X1 is obtained from S 2 \u0002 S 2 by attaching a 3 cell e3 to the second S 2 factor by a map of degree 2 . Thus X1 has a CW structure with cells e0 , e2 1 , e2 2 , e3 , e4 with e3 attached to the 2 sphere e0 [ e2 2 . The space X2 is obtained from S 2 _ S 2 _ S 4 by attaching a 3 cell to the second S 2 summand by a map of degree 2 , so it has a CW structure with the same collection of ﬁve cells, the only difference being that in X2 the 4 cell is attached trivially. For the space Y we choose a Moore space M—Z2; 2– , with cells labeled f 0 , f 2 , f 3 , the 3 cell being attached by a map of degree 2 . From cellular cohomology we see that both H\u0003—X1; Z– and H\u0003—X2; Z– consist of Z ’s in dimensions 0 , 2 , and 4 , and a Z2 in dimension 3 . In both cases all cup products of positive-dimensional classes are zero since for dimension reasons the only possible nontrivial product is the square of the 2 dimensional class, but this is zero as one sees by restricting to the subcomplex S 2 \u0002 S 2 or S 2 _ S 2 _ S 4 . For the space Y we have H\u0003—Y ; Z– consisting of a Z in dimension 0 and a Z2 in dimension 3 , so the cup product structure here is trivial as well. With Z2 coefﬁcients the cellular cochain complexes for Xi , Y , and Xi \u0002 Y are all trivial, so we can identify the cells with a basis for Z2 cohomology. In Xi and Y the only nontrivial Z2 Bocksteins are \f—e2 2– … e3 and \f—f 2– … f 3 . The Bocksteins in Xi \u0002 Y can then be computed using the product formula for \f , which applies to cross product as well as cup product since cross product is deﬁned in terms of cup product. The results are shown in the following table, where an arrow denotes a nontrivial Bockstein. 308 Chapter 3 Cohomology e 0 f 0 1£ e 2 f 0£ 2e 2 f 0£ e 0 f 2£ e 3 f 0£ e 0 f 3£ e 4 f 0£ 1e 2 2e 2 2e 2 f 2£ f 2£ 1e 2 f 3£ e 3 f 2£ f 3£ e 4 f 2£ e 3 f 3£ e 4 f 3£ ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡! ¡¡! ¡¡! The two arrows from e2 2 \u0002 f 2 mean that \f—e2 2 \u0002 f 2– … e3 \u0002 f 2 ‡ e2 2 \u0002 f 3 . It is evident that BH\u0003—Xi \u0002 Y ; Z2– consists of Z2 ’s in dimensions 0 , 2 , and 4 , so Proposition 3E.3 implies that the nontorsion in H\u0003—Xi \u0002 Y ; Z– consists of Z ’s in these dimensions. Fur- thermore, by Corollary 3E.4 the 2 torsion in H\u0003—Xi \u0002 Y ; Z– corresponds to the image of \f and consists of Z2 \u0002 Z2 ’s in dimensions 3 and 5 together with Z2 ’s in dimensions 6 and 7 . In particular, there is a Z2 corresponding to e3 \u0002 f 2 ‡e2 2 \u0002 f 3 in dimension 5 . There is no p torsion for odd primes p since H\u0003—Xi \u0002 Y ; Zp– ˇ H\u0003—Xi; Zp– ⊗ H\u0003—Y ; Zp– is nonzero only in even dimensions. We can see now that with Z coefﬁcients, the cup product H2 \u0002 H5!H7 is nontriv- ial for X1 \u0002 Y but trivial for X2 \u0002 Y . For in H\u0003—Xi \u0002 Y ; Z2– we have, using the relation —a\u0002 b– ` —c \u0002 d– … —a ` c–\u0002 —b ` d– which follows immediately from the deﬁnition of cross product, (1) e2 1 \u0002 f 0 ` e2 1 \u0002 f 3 … —e2 1 ` e2 1–\u0002 —f 0 ` f 3– … 0 since e2 1 ` e2 1 … 0 (2) e2 1 \u0002 f 0 ` —e3 \u0002 f 2 ‡ e2 2 \u0002 f 3– … —e2 1 ` e3–\u0002 —f 0 ` f 2– ‡ —e2 1 ` e2 2–\u0002 —f 0 ` f 3– … —e2 1 ` e2 2–\u0002 f 3 since e2 1 ` e3 … 0 and in H7—Xi \u0002 Y ; Z2– ˇ H7—Xi \u0002 Y ; Z– we have —e2 1 ` e2 2–\u0002 f 3 … e4 \u0002 f 3 ﬂ 0 for i … 1 but —e2 1 ` e2 2–\u0002 f 3 … 0\u0002 f 3 … 0 for i … 2. Thus the cohomology ring of a product space is not always determined by the cohomology rings of the factors. Example 3E.7. Bockstein homomorphisms can be used to get a more complete pic- ture of the structure of H\u0003—SO—n–; Z– than we obtained in the preceding section. Continuing the notation employed there, we know from the calculation for RP1 in Example 3E.1 that \f (Pj \u000b 2i−1 j \u0001 … P j \u000b 2i j and \f (P j \u000b 2i j \u0001 … 0 , hence \f—\f2i−1– … \f2i and \f—\f2i– … 0 . Taking the case n … 5 as an example, we have H\u0003—SO—5–; Z2– ˇ Z2ƒ\f1;\f3⁄=—\f 8 1;\f 2 3– . The upper part of the table at the top of the next page shows the nontrivial Bocksteins. Once again two arrows from an element mean ‘sum,’ for example \f—\f1\f3– … \f—\f1–\f3 ‡ \f1\f—\f3– … \f2\f3 ‡ \f1\f4 … \f2 1\f3 ‡ \f 5 1 . This Bockstein data allows us to calculate Hi—SO—5–; Z– modulo odd torsion, with the results indi- cated in the remainder of the table, where the vertical arrows denote the map ˆ .As we showed in Proposition 3D.3, there is no odd torsion, so this in fact gives the full calculation of Hi—SO—5–; Z– .

An exercise at the end of the section is to show that in fact SO—5– is not homotopy equivalent to the product of any two CW complexes with nontrivial cohomology. A natural way to describe H\u0003—SO—5–; Z– would be as a quotient of a free graded commutative associative algebra Fƒx; y; z⁄ over Z with jxj… 2, jyj… 3 , and jzj… 7. Elements of Fƒx; y; z⁄ are representable as polynomials p—x; y; z– , subject only to the relations imposed by commutativity. In particular, since y and z are odd-dimensional we have yz …−zy , and y 2 and z2 are nonzero elements of order 2 in Fƒx; y; z⁄ . Any monomial containing y 2 or z2 as a factor also has order 2 . In these terms, the calculation of H\u0003—SO—5–; Z– can be written H\u0003—SO—5–; Z– ˇ F ƒx; y; z⁄=—2x; x4;y 4;z2;xz; x3 − y 2– The next ﬁgure shows the nontrivial Bocksteins for H\u0003—SO—7–; Z2– . Here the num- bers across the top indicate dimension, stopping with 21 , the dimension of SO—7– . The labels on the dots refer to the basis of products of distinct \fi ’s. For example, the dot labeled 135 is \f1\f3\f5 . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ; 1 2 3 4 14 123 12 13 23 24 124 34 134 234 1234 35 36 45 46 5 6 16 26 15 25 125 126 136 245 135 246 145 236 235 146 56 156 236 356 456 2356 1256 1356 1456 2456 12356 12456 13456 23456 123456 3456 1234612345 2345 23461346 1345 12461245 1235 1236 345 346 The left-right symmetry of the ﬁgure displays Poincar´e duality quite graphically. Note that the corresponding diagram for SO—5– , drawn in a slightly different way from 310 Chapter 3 Cohomology the preceding ﬁgure, occurs in the upper left corner as the subdiagram with labels 1 through 4 . This subdiagram has the symmetry of Poincar´e duality as well. From the diagram one can with some effort work out the cup product structure in H\u0003—SO—7–; Z– , but the answer is rather complicated, just as the diagram is: F ƒx; y; z; v; w⁄=—2x; 2v; x4;y 4;z2;v 2;w 2;xz; vz; vw; y 2w; x3y 2v; y 2z − x3v; xw − y 2v − x3v– where x , y , z , v , w have dimensions 2 , 3 , 7 , 7 , 11 , respectively. It is curious that the relation x3 … y 2 in H\u0003—SO—5–; Z– no longer holds in H\u0003—SO—7–; Z– . Exercises 1. Show that H\u0003—K—Zm; 1–; Zk– is isomorphic as a ring to H\u0003—K—Zm; 1–; Zm– ⊗ Zk if k divides m . In particular, if m=k is even, this is ÓZk ƒx⁄ ⊗ Zkƒy⁄ . 2. In this problem we will derive one half of the classiﬁcation of lens spaces up to homotopy equivalence, by showing that if Lm—`1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`n– ' Lm—`0 1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;`0 n– then `1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 `n \u0011\u0006`0 1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 `0 nk n mod m for some integer k .

Let X be the smash product of k copies of a Moore space M—Zp;n– with p prime. Compute the Bockstein homomorphisms in H\u0003—X; Zp– and use this to de- scribe H\u0003—X; Z– . 4. Using the cup product structure in H\u0003—SO—5–; Z– , show that SO—5– is not homotopy equivalent to the product of any two CW complexes with nontrivial cohomology. Limits and Ext Section 3.F 311 It often happens that one has a CW complex X expressed as a union of an in- creasing sequence of subcomplexes X0 ˆ X1 ˆ X2 ˆ\u0001\u0001\u0001 . For example, Xi could be the i skeleton of X , or the Xi ’s could be ﬁnite complexes whose union is X . In situa- tions of this sort, Proposition 3.33 says that Hn—X; G– is the direct limit lim --!Hn—Xi; G– . Our goal in this section is to show this holds more generally for any homology the- ory, and to derive the corresponding formula for cohomology theories, which is a bit more complicated even for ordinary cohomology with Z coefﬁcients. For ordinary homology and cohomology the results apply somewhat more generally than just to CW complexes, since if a space X is the union of an increasing sequence of subspaces Xi with the property that each compact set in X is contained in some Xi , then the singular complex of X is the union of the singular complexes of the Xi ’s, and so this gives a reduction to the CW case. Passing to limits can often result in nonﬁnitely generated homology and cohomol- ogy groups. At the end of this section we describe some of the rather subtle behavior of Ext for nonﬁnitely generated groups. Direct and Inverse Limits As a special case of the general deﬁnition in x3.3, the direct limit lim --!Gi of a sequence of homomorphisms of abelian groups G1 \u000b1---------! G2 \u000b2---------! G3 ----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 is deﬁned to be the quotient of the direct sum L i Gi by the subgroup consisting of elements of the form —g1;g2 − \u000b1—g1–; g3 − \u000b2—g2–; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . It is easy to see from this deﬁnition that every element of lim --!Gi is represented by an element gi 2 Gi for some i , and two such representatives gi 2 Gi and gj 2 Gj deﬁne the same element of lim --!Gi iff they have the same image in some Gk under the appropriate composition of \u000b` ’s. If all the \u000bi ’s are injective and are viewed as inclusions of subgroups, lim --!Gi is just S i Gi . Example 3F.1. For a prime p , consider the sequence Z p -----! Z p -----! Z -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 with all maps multiplication by p . Then lim --!Gi can be identiﬁed with the subgroup Zƒ1=p⁄ of Q consisting of rational numbers with denominator a power of p . More generally, we can realize any subgroup of Q as the direct limit of a sequence Z -! Z -! Z -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 with an appropriate choice of maps. For example, if the n th map is multiplication by n , then the direct limit is Q itself. Example 3F.2. The sequence of injections Zp p -----! Zp2 p -----! Zp3 -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 , with p prime, has direct limit a group we denote Zp1 . This is isomorphic to Zƒ1=p⁄=Z , the subgroup of Q=Z represented by fractions with denominator a power of p . In fact Q=Z is isomorphic to the direct sum of the subgroups Zƒ1=p⁄=Z ˇ Zp1 for all primes p .It is not hard to determine all the subgroups of Q=Z and see that each one can be realized as a direct limit of ﬁnite cyclic groups with injective maps between them. Conversely, every such direct limit is isomorphic to a subgroup of Q=Z . 312 Chapter 3 Cohomology We can realize these algebraic examples topologically by the following construc- tion. The mapping telescope of a sequence of maps X0 f0---------! X1 f1---------! X2 ----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 is the union of the mapping cylinders Mfi with the copies of Xi in Mfi and Mfi−1 identiﬁed for all i . Thus the mapping tele- X 0 X 1 X 2 X 3 scope is the quotient space of the disjoint union ` i —Xi \u0002 ƒi; i ‡ 1⁄– in which each point —xi;i ‡ 1– 2 Xi \u0002 ƒi; i ‡ 1⁄ is identiﬁed with —fi—xi–; i ‡ 1– 2 Xi‡1 \u0002 ƒi ‡ 1;i ‡ 2⁄ . In the mapping telescope T , let Ti be the union of the ﬁrst i mapping cylinders. This deformation retracts onto Xi by deformation re- tracting each mapping cylinder onto its right end in turn. If the maps fi are cellular, each mapping cylinder is a CW complex and the telescope T is the increasing union of the subcomplexes Ti ' Xi . Then Proposition 3.33, or Theorem 3F.8 below, implies that Hn—T ; G– ˇ lim --!Hn—Xi; G– . Example 3F.3. Suppose each fi is a map S n!S n of degree p for a ﬁxed prime p . Then Hn—T – is the direct limit of the sequence Z p -----! Z p -----! Z -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 considered in Example 3F.1 above, and eHk—T – … 0 for k ﬂ n ,so T is a Moore space M—Zƒ1=p⁄; n– . Example 3F.4. In the preceding example, if we attach a cell en‡1 to the ﬁrst S n in T via the identity map of S n , we obtain a space X which is a Moore space M—Zp1 ;n– since X is the union of its subspaces Xi … Ti [ en‡1 , which are M—Zpi ;n– ’s, and the inclusion Xi ˆ Xi‡1 induces the inclusion Zpi ˆ Zpi‡1 on Hn . Generalizing these two examples, we can obtain Moore spaces M—G; n– for arbi- trary subgroups G of Q or Q=Z by choosing maps fi : S n!S n of suitable degrees. The behavior of cohomology groups is more complicated. If X is the increasing union of subcomplexes Xi , then the cohomology groups Hn—Xi; G– , for ﬁxed n and G , form a sequence of homomorphisms \u0001\u0001\u0001 ------! G2 \u000b2------------! G1 \u000b1------------! G0 Given such a sequence of group homomorphisms, the inverse limit lim -- Gi is deﬁned to be the subgroup of Q i Gi consisting of sequences —gi– with \u000bi—gi– … gi−1 for all i . There is a natural map \u0015 : Hn—X; G–! lim -- Hn—Xi; G– sending an element of Hn—X; G– to its sequence of images in Hn—Xi; G– under the maps Hn—X; G–!Hn—Xi; G– induced by inclusion. One might hope that \u0015 is an isomorphism, but this is not true in general, as we shall see. However, for some choices of G it is: Proposition 3F.5. If the CW complex X is the union of an increasing sequence of sub- complexes Xi and if G is one of the ﬁelds Q or Zp , then \u0015 : Hn—X; G–! lim -- Hn—Xi; G– is an isomorphism for all n . Proof: First we have an easy algebraic fact: Given a sequence of homomorphisms of abelian groups G1 \u000b1-----! G2 \u000b2-----! G3 -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 , then Hom—lim --!Gi;G– … lim -- Hom—Gi;G– Limits and Ext Section 3.F 313 for any G . Namely, it follows from the deﬁnition of lim --!Gi that a homomorphism ' : lim --!Gi!G is the same thing as a sequence of homomorphisms 'i : Gi!G with 'i … 'i‡1\u000bi for all i . Such a sequence —'i– is exactly an element of lim -- Hom—Gi;G– . Now if G is a ﬁeld Q or Zp we have Hn—X; G– … Hom—Hn—X; G–; G– … Hom—lim --!Hn—Xi; G–; G– … lim -- Hom—Hn—Xi; G–; G– … lim -- Hn—Xi; G– tu Let us analyze what happens for cohomology with an arbitrary coefﬁcient group, or more generally for any cohomology theory. Given a sequence of homomorphisms of abelian groups \u0001\u0001\u0001 ------! G2 \u000b2------------! G1 \u000b1------------! G0 deﬁne a map \u000e : Q i Gi!Q i Gi by \u000e—\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;gi; \u0001\u0001\u0001– … —\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;gi − \u000bi‡1—gi‡1–; \u0001\u0001\u0001– , so that lim -- Gi is the kernel of \u000e . Denoting the cokernel of \u000e by lim -- 1Gi , we have then an exact sequence 0 -! lim -- Gi -! Q i Gi \u000e-----! Q i Gi -! lim -- 1Gi -! 0 This may be compared with the corresponding situation for the direct limit of a se- quence G1 \u000b1---------! G2 \u000b2---------! G3 ----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 . In this case one has a short exact sequence 0 -! L i Gi \u000e-----! L i Gi -! lim --!Gi -! 0 where \u000e—\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;gi; \u0001\u0001\u0001– … —\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;gi −\u000bi−1—gi−1–; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ,so \u000e is injective and there is no term lim --! 1Gi analogous to lim -- 1Gi . Here are a few simple observations about lim -- and lim -- 1 : If all the \u000bi ’s are isomorphisms then lim -- Gi ˇ G0 and lim -- 1Gi … 0 . In fact, lim -- 1Gi … 0 if each \u000bi is surjective, for to realize a given element —hi– 2 Q i Gi as \u000e—gi– we can take g0 … 0 and then solve \u000b1—g1– …−h0 , \u000b2—g2– … g1 − h1 , \u0001\u0001\u0001 . If all the \u000bi ’s are zero then lim -- Gi … lim -- 1Gi … 0. Deleting a ﬁnite number of terms from the end of the sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 !G1!G0 does not affect lim -- Gi or lim -- 1Gi . More generally, lim -- Gi and lim -- 1Gi are un- changed if we replace the sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 !G1!G0 by a subsequence, with the appropriate compositions of \u000bj ’s as the maps. Example 3F.6. Consider the sequence of natural surjections \u0001\u0001\u0001 !Zp3!Zp2!Zp with p a prime. The inverse limit of this sequence is a famous object in number theory, called the p adic integers. Our notation for it will be bZp . It is actually a commutative ring, not just a group, since the projections Zpi‡1!Zpi are ring homomorphisms, but we will be interested only in the additive group structure. Elements of bZp are inﬁnite sequences —\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;a2;a1– with ai 2 Zpi such that ai is the mod pi reduction of ai‡1 . 314 Chapter 3 Cohomology For each choice of ai there are exactly p choices for ai‡1 ,so bZp is uncountable. There is a natural inclusion Z ˆ bZp as the constant sequences ai … n 2 Z . It is easy to see that bZp is torsionfree by checking that it has no elements of prime order. There is another way of looking at bZp . An element of bZp has a unique represen- tation as a sequence —\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;a2;a1– of integers ai with 0 \u0014 ai <pi for each i . We can write each ai uniquely in the form bi−1pi−1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ b1p ‡ b0 with 0 \u0014 bj <p . The fact that ai‡1 reduces mod pi to ai means that the numbers bj depend only on the element —\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;a2;a1– 2 bZp , so we can view the elements of bZp as the ‘base p inﬁnite numbers’ \u0001\u0001\u0001 b1b0 with 0 \u0014 bi <p for all i , with the familiar rule for addition in base p notation. The ﬁnite expressions bn \u0001\u0001\u0001 b1b0 represent the nonnegative integers, but negative integers have inﬁnite expansions. For example, −1 has bi … p − 1 for all i , as one can see by adding 1 to this number. Since the maps Zpi‡1!Zpi are surjective, lim -- 1Zpi … 0 . The next example shows how p adic integers can also give rise to a nonvanishing lim -- 1 term. Example 3F.7. Consider the sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Z p -----! Z p -----! Z for p prime. In this case the inverse limit is zero since a nonzero integer can only be divided by p ﬁnitely often. The lim -- 1 term is the cokernel of the map \u000e : Q 1 Z!Q 1 Z given by \u000e—y1;y2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– … —y1 − py2;y2 − py3; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . We claim that the map bZp=Z! Coker \u000e sending a p adic number \u0001\u0001\u0001 b1b0 as in the preceding example to —b0;b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001– is an isomorphism. To see this, note that the image of \u000e consists of the sums y1—1; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001–‡y2—−p; 1; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001–‡ y3—0; −p; 1; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 . The terms after y1—1; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001– give exactly the relations that hold among the p adic numbers \u0001\u0001\u0001 b1b0 , and in particular allow one to reduce an arbitrary sequence —b0;b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001– to a unique sequence with 0 \u0014 bi <p for all i . The term y1—1; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001– corresponds to the subgroup Z ˆ bZp . We come now to the main result of this section: Theorem 3F.8. For a CW complex X which is the union of an increasing sequence of subcomplexes X0 ˆ X1 ˆ\u0001\u0001\u0001 there is an exact sequence 0 -! lim -- 1h n−1—Xi– -! h n—X– \u0015-----! lim -- h n—Xi– -! 0 where h\u0003 is any reduced or unreduced cohomology theory. For any homology theory h\u0003 , reduced or unreduced, the natural maps lim --!hn—Xi–!hn—X– are isomorphisms. Proof: Let T be the mapping telescope of the inclusion sequence X0>X1>\u0001\u0001\u0001 . This is a subcomplex of X \u0002 ƒ0; 1– when ƒ0; 1– is given the CW structure with the integer points as 0 cells. We have T ' X since T is a deformation retract of X \u0002 ƒ0; 1– ,as we showed in the proof of Lemma 2.34 in the special case that Xi is the i skeleton of X , but the argument works just as well for arbitrary subcomplexes Xi . Let T1 ˆ T be the union of the products Xi \u0002 ƒi; i ‡ 1⁄ for i odd, and let T2 be the corresponding union for i even. Thus T1 \\ T2 … ` i Xi and T1 [ T2 … T . For an unreduced cohomology theory h\u0003 we have then a Mayer–Vietoris sequence Limits and Ext Section 3.F 315 ¡!¡!¡!¡!Th 1 h n h nnn() -n 1 Th 2() -n 1© Th 1() Th 2()©Th 1( T( -n 1 T2))\\ ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!Xh ii h n() -n 1 X() T1( T2)\\ ⁄ Xh ii () -n 1⁄ Xh ii () n⁄ Xh ii () n⁄¼¼¼¼¼ '' The maps ' making the diagram commute are given by the formula '—\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;gi; \u0001\u0001\u0001– … —\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;—−1–i−1—gi − ˆ—gi‡1––; \u0001\u0001\u0001– , the ˆ ’s being the appropriate restriction maps. This differs from \u000e only in the sign of its even coordinates, so if we change the isomor- phism hk—T1 \\ T2– ˇ Q i h k—Xi– by inserting a minus sign in the even coordinates, we can replace ' by \u000e in the second row of the diagram. This row then yields a short ex- act sequence 0! Coker \u000e!hn—X; G–! Ker \u000e!0 , ﬁnishing the proof for unreduced cohomology. The same argument works for reduced cohomology if we use the reduced tele- scope obtained from T by collapsing fx0g\u0002 ƒ0; 1– to a point, for x0 a basepoint 0 cell of X0 . Then T1 \\ T2 … W i Xi rather than ` i Xi , and the rest of the argument goes through unchanged. The proof also applies for homology theories, with direct products replaced by direct sums in the second row of the diagram. As we noted earlier, Ker \u000e … 0 in the direct limit case, and Coker \u000e … lim --!. tu Example 3F.9. As in Example 3F.3, consider the mapping telescope T for the sequence of degree p maps S n!S n! \u0001\u0001\u0001 . Letting Ti be the union of the ﬁrst i mapping cylin- ders in the telescope, the inclusions T1 > T2 > \u0001\u0001\u0001 induce on Hn—−; Z– the sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Z p -----! Z in Example 3F.7. From the theorem we deduce that Hn‡1—T ; Z– ˇ bZp=Z and eHk—T ; Z– … 0 for k ﬂ n‡1 . Thus we have the rather strange situation that the CW complex T is the union of subcomplexes Ti each having cohomology consisting only of a Z in dimension n , but T itself has no cohomology in dimension n and instead has a huge uncountable group bZp=Z in dimension n ‡ 1 . This contrasts sharply with what happens for homology, where the groups Hn—Ti– ˇ Z ﬁt together nicely to give Hn—T – ˇ Zƒ1=p⁄ . Example 3F.10. A more reasonable behavior is exhibited if we consider the space X … M—Zp1 ;n– in Example 3F.4 expressed as the union of its subspaces Xi . By the universal coefﬁcient theorem, the reduced cohomology of Xi with Z coefﬁcients con- sists of a Zpi … Ext—Zpi ; Z– in dimension n ‡ 1 . The inclusion Xi > Xi‡1 induces the inclusion Zpi > Zpi‡1 on Hn , and on Ext this induced map is a surjection Zpi‡1!Zpi as one can see by looking at the diagram of free resolutions on the left:¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! p p pp i iZ ¡¡¡¡¡!Z ¡¡¡¡¡!Z 00 ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! p pi 1 i 1Z ¡¡¡¡¡!Z ¡¡¡¡¡!Z 00 + + 11 ¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!pi Z¡¡¡¡¡!Z0¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!i 10 + 11 Ext(), p ZZExt(), ZZHom(),¡¡¡¡¡!ZZHom(), ... ... Applying Hom—−; Z– to this diagram, we get the diagram on the right, with exact rows, and the left-hand vertical map is a surjection since the vertical map to the right of it is surjective. Thus the sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 !Hn‡1—X2; Z–!Hn‡1—X1; Z– is the 316 Chapter 3 Cohomology sequence in Example 3F.6, and we deduce that Hn‡1—X; Z– ˇ bZp , the p adic integers, and eHk—X; Z– … 0 for k ﬂ n ‡ 1. This example can be related to the preceding one. If we view X as the map- ping cone of the inclusion S n>T of one end of the telescope, then the long exact sequences of homology and cohomology groups for the pair —T ; S n– reduce to the short exact sequences at the right. n ¡!¡! X 00 Hn()¡!THn()¡!SHn() nn ¡!¡! T 00 H ()¡!XH ()¡!SH () n 1+ n 1+== Z==== Z== Z[1/p p]== Z p== Z 1 /b pZZb From these examples and the universal coefﬁcient theorem we obtain isomor- phisms Ext—Zp1 ; Z– ˇ bZp and Ext—Zƒ1=p⁄; Z– ˇ bZp=Z . These can also be derived directly from the deﬁnition of Ext . A free resolution of Zp1 is 0 -! Z 1 ' -----! Z 1 -! Zp1 -! 0 where Z1 is the direct sum of an inﬁnite number of Z ’s, the sequences —x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– of integers all but ﬁnitely many of which are zero, and ' sends —x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– to —px1 − x2;px2 − x3; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . We can view ' as the linear map corresponding to the inﬁ- nite matrix with p ’s on the diagonal, −1 ’s just above the diagonal, and 0 ’s everywhere else. Clearly Ker ' … 0 since integers cannot be divided by p inﬁnitely often. The im- age of ' is generated by the vectors —p; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001–; —−1;p; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001–; —0; −1;p; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001–; \u0001\u0001\u0001 so Coker ' ˇ Zp1 . Dualizing by taking Hom—−; Z– , we have Hom—Z 1; Z– the inﬁnite di- rect product of Z ’s, and '\u0003—y1;y2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– … —py1;py2 −y1;py3 −y2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– , correspond- ing to the transpose of the matrix of ' . By deﬁnition, Ext—Zp1 ; Z– … Coker '\u0003 . The image of '\u0003 consists of the inﬁnite sums y1—p; −1; 0 \u0001\u0001\u0001– ‡ y2—0;p; −1; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 , so Coker '\u0003 can be identiﬁed with bZp by rewriting a sequence —z1;z2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– as the p adic number \u0001\u0001\u0001 z2z1 . The calculation Ext—Zƒ1=p⁄; Z– ˇ bZp=Z is quite similar. A free resolution of Zƒ1=p⁄ can be obtained from the free resolution of Zp1 by omitting the ﬁrst col- umn of the matrix of ' and, for convenience, changing sign. This gives the for- mula '—x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– … —x1;x2 − px1;x3 − px2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– , with the image of ' generated by the elements —1; −p; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001– , —0; 1; −p; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001–; \u0001\u0001\u0001 . The dual map '\u0003 is given by '\u0003—y1;y2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– … —y1 − py2;y2 − py3; \u0001\u0001\u0001– , and this has image consisting of the sums y1—1; 0 \u0001\u0001\u0001– ‡ y2—−p; 1; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ‡ y3—0; −p; 1; 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 , so we get Ext—Zƒ1=p⁄; Z– … Coker '\u0003 ˇ bZp=Z . Note that '\u0003 is exactly the map \u000e in Example 3F.7. It is interesting to note also that the map ' : Z 1!Z 1 in the two cases Zp1 and Zƒ1=p⁄ is precisely the cellular boundary map Hn‡1—Xn‡1;Xn–!Hn—Xn;Xn−1– for the Moore space M—Zp1 ;n– or M—Zƒ1=p⁄; n– constructed as the mapping telescope of the sequence of degree p maps S n!S n! \u0001\u0001\u0001 , with a cell en‡1 attached to the ﬁrst S n in the case of Zp1 . Limits and Ext Section 3.F 317 More About Ext The functors Hom and Ext behave fairly simply for ﬁnitely generated groups, when cohomology and homology are essentially the same except for a dimension shift in the torsion. But matters are more complicated in the nonﬁnitely generated case. A useful tool for getting a handle on this complication is the following: Proposition 3F.11. Given an abelian group G and a short exact sequence of abelian groups 0!A!B!C!0 , there are exact sequences 0!Hom—G; A–!Hom—G; B–!Hom—G; C–!Ext—G; A–!Ext—G; B–!Ext—G; C–!0 0!Hom—C; G–!Hom—B; G–!Hom—A; G–!Ext—C; G–!Ext—B; G–!Ext—A; G–!0 Proof: A free resolution 0!F1!F0!G!0 gives rise to a commutative diagram Hom A00F1(), ¡¡¡¡! Hom BF1(), ¡¡¡¡! Hom CF1(), ¡¡¡!¡¡¡! Hom A00F0(), ¡¡¡¡! Hom BF0(), ¡¡¡¡! Hom CF0(), ¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! Since F0 and F1 are free, the two rows are exact, as they are simply direct products of copies of the exact sequence 0!A!B!C!0 , in view of the general fact that Hom—LiGi;H– … Q i Hom—Gi;H– . Enlarging the diagram by zeros above and below, it becomes a short exact sequence of chain complexes, and the associated long exact sequence of homology groups is the ﬁrst of the two six-term exact sequences in the proposition. To obtain the other exact sequence we will construct the commutative diagram at the right, where the columns are free resolutions and the¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡! F 0 1 ¡¡¡!F 00¡¡!00¡¡¡!F11¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡! F 0 0 ¡¡¡!F 00¡¡!00¡¡¡!F00¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡! A ¡¡¡!B 00 00 0 00 0¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! ¡¡¡!Crows are exact. To start, let F0!A and F 00 0 !C be surjections from free abelian groups onto A and C . Then let F 0 0 … F0 \b F 00 0 , with the obvious maps in the second row, inclusion and projection. The map F 0 0!B is deﬁned on the summand F0 to make the lower left square commute, and on the summand F 00 0 it is deﬁned by sending basis elements of F 00 0 to elements of B mapping to the images of these basis elements in C , so the lower right square also commutes. Now we have the bottom two rows of the diagram, and we can regard these two rows as a short exact sequence of two-term chain complexes. The associated long exact sequence of homology groups has six terms, the ﬁrst three being the kernels of the three vertical maps to A , B , and C , and the last three being the cokernels of these maps. Since the vertical maps to A and C are surjective, the fourth and sixth of the six homology groups vanish, hence also the ﬁfth, which says the vertical map to B is surjective. The ﬁrst three of the original six homology groups form a short exact sequence, and we let this be the top row of the diagram, formed by the kernels of the vertical maps to A , B , and C . These kernels are subgroups of free abelian groups, hence are also free. 318 Chapter 3 Cohomology Thus the three columns are free resolutions. The upper two squares automatically commute, so the construction of the diagram is complete. The ﬁrst two rows of the diagram split by freeness, so applying Hom—−;G– yields a diagram Hom G00F1(), ¡¡¡¡¡! Hom GF1(), ¡¡¡¡¡! Hom GF1(), ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! Hom G00F0(), ¡¡¡¡¡! Hom GF0(), ¡¡¡¡¡! Hom GF0(), ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!0 000 00 with exact rows. Again viewing this as a short exact sequence of chain complexes, the associated long exact sequence of homology groups is the second six-term exact sequence in the statement of the proposition. tu The second sequence in the proposition says in particular that an injection A!B induces a surjection Ext—B; C–!Ext—A; C– for any C . For example, if A has torsion, this says Ext—A; Z– is nonzero since it maps onto Ext—Zn; Z– ˇ Zn for some n> 1. The calculation Ext—Zp1 ; Z– ˇ bZp earlier in this section shows that torsion in A does not necessarily yield torsion in Ext—A; Z– , however. Also useful are the formulas Ext—L i Ai;B– ˇ Q i Ext—Ai;B– Ext—A; L i Bi– ˇ L i Ext—A; Bi– whose proofs we leave as exercises. For example, since Q=Z … L p Zp1 we obtain Ext—Q=Z; Z– ˇ Q p bZp from the calculation Ext—Zp1 ; Z– ˇ bZp . Then from the exact sequence 0!Z!Q!Q=Z!0 we get Ext—Q; Z– ˇ —Q p bZp–=Z using the second exact sequence in the proposition. In these examples the groups Ext—A; Z– are rather large, and the next result says this is part of a general pattern: Proposition 3F.12. If A is not ﬁnitely generated then either Hom—A; Z– or Ext—A; Z– is uncountable. Hence if Hn—X; Z– is not ﬁnitely generated then either Hn—X; Z– or Hn‡1—X; Z– is uncountable. Both possibilities can occur, as we see from the examples Hom—L 1Z; Z– ˇ Q 1 Z and Ext—Zp1 ; Z– ˇ bZp . This proposition has some interesting topological consequences. First, it implies that if a space X has eH\u0003—X; Z– … 0 , then eH\u0003—X; Z– … 0 , since the case of ﬁnitely generated homology groups follows from our earlier results. And second, it says that one cannot always construct a space X with prescribed cohomology groups Hn—X; Z– , as one can for homology. For example there is no space whose only nonvanishing eHn—X; Z– is a countable nonﬁnitely generated group such as Q or Q=Z . Even in the ﬁnitely generated case the dimension n … 1 is somewhat special since the group H1—X; Z– ˇ Hom—H1—X–; Z– is always torsionfree. Limits and Ext Section 3.F 319 Proof: Consider the map A p -----! A , a , pa , multiplication by the positive integer p . Denote the kernel, image, and cokernel of this map by pA , pA , and Ap , respectively. The short exact sequences 0!pA!A!pA!0 and 0!pA!A!Ap!0 give two six-term exact sequences involving Hom—−; Z– and Ext—−; Z– . The parts of these exact sequences we need are 0 -! Hom—pA; Z– ˇ-----! Hom—A; Z– -! Hom—pA; Z– … 0 Hom—pA; Z– -! Ext—Ap; Z– -! Ext—A; Z– where the term Hom—pA; Z– in the ﬁrst sequence is zero since pA is a torsion group. Now let p be a prime, so Ap is a vector space over Zp . If this vector space is inﬁnite-dimensional, it is an inﬁnite direct sum of Zp ’s and Ext—Ap; Z– is the direct product of an inﬁnite numbers of Zp ’s, hence uncountable. Exactness of the sec- ond sequence above then implies that one of the two adjacent terms Ext—A; Z– or Hom—pA; Z– ˇ Hom—A; Z– must be uncountable, so we are done when Ap is inﬁnite. At the other extreme is the possibility that Ap … 0 . This means that A … pA , so every element of A is divisible by p . Hence if A is nontrivial, it then contains a subgroup isomorphic to either Zƒ1=p⁄ or Zp1 . We have seen that Ext—Zƒ1=p⁄; Z– ˇ bZp=Z and Ext—Zp1 ; Z– ˇ bZp , an uncountable group in either case. As noted earlier, an inclusion B>A induces a surjection Ext—A; Z–!Ext—B; Z– , so it follows that Ext—A; Z– is uncountable when Ap … 0 and A ﬂ 0. The remaining case that Ap is a ﬁnite direct sum of Zp ’s will be reduced to the case Ap … 0 . Choose ﬁnitely many elements of A whose images in Ap are a set of generators, and let B ˆ A be the subgroup generated by these elements. Thus the map Bp!Ap induced by the inclusion B > A is surjective. The func- tor A , Ap is the same as A , A ⊗ Zp , so exactness of B!A!A=B!0 implies exactness of Bp!Ap!—A=B–p!0 , and hence —A=B–p … 0. If A is not ﬁnitely generated, A=B is nonzero, so the preceding case implies that Ext—A=B; Z– is un- countable. This implies that Ext—A; Z– is also uncountable via the exact sequence Hom—B; Z–!Ext—A=B; Z–!Ext—A; Z– , since Hom—B; Z– is ﬁnitely generated and there- fore countable. tu From this proposition one might conjecture that cohomology groups with Z co- efﬁcients are either ﬁnitely generated or uncountable. As was explained in x3.1, the functor Ext generalizes to a sequence of functors Extn R for modules over a ring R . In this generality the six-term sequences of Propo- sition 3F.11 become long exact sequences of Ext n R groups associated to short exact sequences of R modules. These are derived in a similar fashion, by constructing short exact sequences of free resolutions. There are also analogous long exact sequences for the functors Tor R n , specializing to six-term sequences when R … Z . These six- term sequences are perhaps less useful than their Ext analogs, however, since Tor is 320 Chapter 3 Cohomology less mysterious than Ext for nonﬁnitely generated groups, as it commutes with direct limits, according to an exercise for x3.A. Exercises 1. Given maps fi : Xi!Xi‡1 for integers i< 0 , show that the ‘reverse mapping tele- scope’ obtained by glueing together the mapping cylinders of the fi ’s in the obvious way deformation retracts onto X0 .

There is a simple construction called ‘transfer’ that provides very useful informa- tion about homology and cohomology of ﬁnite-sheeted covering spaces. After giving the deﬁnition and proving a few elementary properties, we will use the transfer in the construction of a number of spaces whose Zp cohomology is a polynomial ring. Let ˇ : eX!X be an n sheeted covering space, for some ﬁnite n . In addition to the induced map on singular chains ˇ] : Ck— eX–!Ck—X– there is also a homomor- phism in the opposite direction ˝ : Ck—X–!Ck— eX– which assigns to a singular simplex ˙ : Ñk!X the sum of the n distinct lifts e˙ : Ñ k! eX . This is obviously a chain map, commuting with boundary homomorphisms, so it induces transfer homomorphisms ˝\u0003 : Hk—X; G–!Hk— eX; G– and ˝ \u0003 : Hk— eX; G–!Hk—X; G– for any coefﬁcient group G . We focus on cohomology in what follows, but similar statements hold for homology as well. The composition ˇ]˝ is clearly multiplication by n , hence ˝ \u0003ˇ \u0003 … n . This has the consequence that the kernel of ˇ \u0003 : Hk—X; G–!Hk— eX; G– consists of torsion elements of order dividing n , since ˇ \u0003—\u000b– … 0 implies ˝ \u0003ˇ \u0003—\u000b– … n\u000b … 0 . Thus the cohomology of eX must be ‘larger’ than that of X except possibly for torsion of order dividing n . This can be a genuine exception as one sees from the examples of S m covering RPm and lens spaces. More generally, if S m!X is any n sheeted covering space, then the relation ˝ \u0003ˇ \u0003 … n implies that eH\u0003—X; Z– consists entirely of torsion elements of order dividing n , apart from a possible Z in dimension m . (Since X is a closed manifold, its homology groups are ﬁnitely generated by Corollaries A.8 and A.9 in the Appendix.) By studying the other composition ˇ \u0003˝ \u0003 we will prove: Proposition 3G.1. Let ˇ : eX!X be an n sheeted covering space deﬁned by an ac- tion of a group Ð on eX . Then with coefﬁcients in a ﬁeld F whose characteristic is 0 or a prime not dividing n , the map ˇ \u0003 : Hk—X; F–!Hk— eX; F– is injective with image the subgroup H\u0003— eX; F– Ð consisting of classes \u000b such that γ\u0003—\u000b– … \u000b for all γ 2 Ð . 322 Chapter 3 Cohomology Proof: We have already seen that elements of the kernel of ˇ \u0003 have ﬁnite order dividing n ,so ˇ \u0003 is injective for the coefﬁcient ﬁelds we are considering here. It remains to describe the image of ˇ \u0003 . Note ﬁrst that ˝ˇ] sends a singular simplex Ñk! eX to the sum of all its images under the Ð action. Hence ˇ \u0003˝ \u0003—\u000b– … P γ2Ð γ\u0003—\u000b– for \u000b 2 Hk— eX; F– .If \u000b is ﬁxed under the action of Ð on Hk— eX; F– , the sum P γ2Ð γ\u0003—\u000b– equals n\u000b , so if the coefﬁcient ﬁeld F has characteristic 0 or a prime not dividing n , we can write \u000b … ˇ \u0003˝ \u0003—\u000b=n– and thus \u000b lies in the image of ˇ \u0003 . Conversely, since ˇγ … ˇ for all γ 2 Ð , we have γ\u0003ˇ \u0003—\u000b– … ˇ \u0003—\u000b– for all \u000b , and so the image of ˇ \u0003 is contained in H\u0003— eX; F– Ð . tu Example 3G.2. Let X … S 1 _ S k , k> 1 , with eX the n sheeted cover corresponding to the index n subgroup of ˇ1—X– ,so eX is a circle with nS k ’s attached at equally spaced points around the circle. The deck transformation group Zn acts by rotating the circle, permuting the S k ’s cyclically. Hence for any coefﬁcient group G , the in- variant cohomology H\u0003— eX; G– Zn is all of H0 and H1 , plus a copy of G in dimension k , the cellular cohomology classes assigning the same element of G to each S k . Thus Hi— eX; G– Zn is exactly the image of ˇ \u0003 for i … 0 and k , while the image of ˇ \u0003 in dimension 1 is the subgroup nH1— eX; G– . Whether this equals H1— eX; G– Zn or not de- pends on G . For G … Q or Zp with p not dividing n , we have equality, but not for G … Z or Zp with p dividing n . In this last case the map ˇ \u0003 is not injective on H1 . Spaces with Polynomial mod p Cohomology An interesting special case of the general problem of realizing graded commuta- tive rings as cup product rings of spaces is the case of polynomial rings Zpƒx1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn⁄ over the coefﬁcient ﬁeld Zp , p prime. The basic question here is, which sets of num- bers d1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;dn are realizable as the dimensions jxij of the generators xi ? From x3.2 we have the examples of products of CP1 ’s and HP1 ’s with di ’s equal to 2 or 4 , for arbitrary p , and when p … 2 we can also take RP1 ’s with di ’s equal to 1 . As an application of transfer homomorphisms we will construct some examples with larger di ’s. In the case of polynomials in one variable, it turns out that these examples realize everything that can be realized. But for two or more variables, more sophisticated techniques are necessary to realize all the realizable cases; see the end of this section for further remarks on this. The construction can be outlined as follows. Start with a space Y already known to have polynomial cohomology H\u0003—Y ; Zp– … Zpƒy1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;yn⁄ , and suppose there is an action of a ﬁnite group Ð on Y . A simple trick called the Borel construction shows that without loss of generality we may assume the action is free, deﬁning a covering space Y!Y=Ð . Then by Proposition 3G.1 above, if p does not divide the order of Ð , H\u0003—Y =Ð ; Zp– is isomorphic to the subring of Zpƒy1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;yn⁄ consisting of polynomials that are invariant under the induced action of Ð on H\u0003—Y ; Zp– . And in some cases this subring is itself a polynomial ring. Transfer Homomorphisms Section 3.G 323 For example, if Y is the product of n copies of CP1 then the symmetric group Ön acts on Y by permuting the factors, with the induced action on H\u0003—Y ; Zp– ˇ Zpƒy1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;yn⁄ permuting the yi ’s. A standard theorem in algebra says that the invariant polynomials form a polynomial ring Zpƒ˙1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;˙n⁄ where ˙i is the i th elementary symmetric polynomial, the sum of all products of i distinct yj ’s. Thus ˙i is a homogeneous polynomial of degree i . The order of Ön is n! so the condition that p not divide the order of Ð amounts to p> n . Thus we realize the polynomial ring Zpƒx1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn⁄ with jxij… 2i , provided that p> n . This example is less than optimal since there happens to be another space, the Grassmann manifold of n dimensional linear subspaces of C 1 , whose cohomology with any coefﬁcient ring R is Rƒx1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn⁄ with jxij… 2i , as we show in x4.D, so the restriction p> n is not really necessary. To get further examples the idea is to replace CP1 by a space with the same Zp cohomology but with ‘more symmetry,’ allowing for larger groups Ð to act. The constructions will be made using K—ˇ ; 1– spaces, which were introduced in x1.B. For a group ˇ we constructed there a Ñ complex Bˇ with contractible universal cover Eˇ . The construction is functorial: A homomorphism ' : ˇ!ˇ 0 induces a map B' : Bˇ!Bˇ 0 , B'—ƒg1j \u0001\u0001\u0001 jgn⁄– … ƒ'—g1–j\u0001\u0001\u0001 j'—gn–⁄ , satisfying the functor prop- erties B—' – … B'B and B11 … 11 . In particular, if Ð is a group of automorphisms of ˇ , then Ð acts on Bˇ . The other ingredient we shall need is the Borel construction, which converts an action of a group Ð on a space Y into a free action of Ð on a homotopy equivalent space Y 0 . Namely, take Y 0 … Y \u0002 EÐ with the diagonal action of Ð , γ—y; z– … —γy; γz– where Ð acts on EÐ as deck transformations. The diagonal action is free, in fact a covering space action, since this is true for the action in the second coordinate. The orbit space of this diagonal action is denoted Y \u0002Ð EÐ . Example 3G.3. Let ˇ … Zp and let Ð be the full automorphism group Aut—Zp– . Automorphisms of Zp have the form x , mx for —m; p– … 1, so Ð is the multi- plicative group of invertible elements in the ﬁeld Zp . By elementary ﬁeld theory this is a cyclic group, of order p − 1 . The preceding constructions then give a covering space K—Zp; 1–!K—Zp; 1–=Ð with H\u0003—K—Zp; 1–=Ð ; Zp– ˇ H\u0003—K—Zp; 1–; Zp– Ð . We may assume we are in the nontrivial case p> 2 . From the calculation of the cup product structure of lens spaces in Example 3.41 or Example 3E.2 we have H\u0003—K—Zp; 1–; Zp– ˇ ÓZp ƒ\u000b⁄ ⊗ Zpƒ\f⁄ with j\u000bj… 1 and j\fj… 2 , and we need to ﬁgure out how Ð acts on this cohomology ring. Let γ 2 Ð be a generator, say γ—x– … mx . The induced action of γ on ˇ1K—Zp; 1– is also multiplication by m since we have taken K—Zp; 1– … BZp \u0002 EÐ and γ takes an edge loop ƒg⁄ in BZp to ƒγ—g–⁄ … ƒmg⁄ . Hence γ acts on H1—K—Zp; 1–; Z– by multi- plication by m . It follows that γ—\u000b– … m\u000b and γ—\f– … m\f since H1—K—Zp; 1–; Zp– ˇ Hom—H1—K—Zp; 1––; Zp– and H2—K—Zp; 1–; Zp– ˇ Ext—H1—K—Zp; 1––; Zp– , and it is a gen- 324 Chapter 3 Cohomology eral fact, following easily from the deﬁnitions, that multiplication by an integer m in an abelian group H induces multiplication by m in Hom—H; G– and Ext—H; G– . Thus γ—\fk– … mk\f k and γ—\u000b\f k– … mk‡1\u000b\f k . Since m was chosen to be a generator of the multiplicative group of invertible elements of Zp , it follows that the only elements of H\u0003—K—Zp; 1–; Zp– ﬁxed by γ , hence by Ð , are the scalar multiples of \fi—p−1– and \u000b\fi—p−1–−1 . Thus H\u0003—K—Zp; 1–; Zp–Ð … ÓZp ƒ\u000b\f p−2⁄ ⊗ Zpƒ\f p−1⁄ , so we have produced a space whose Zp cohomology ring is ÓZp ƒx2p−3⁄ ⊗ Zpƒy2p−2⁄ , subscripts indicating dimension. Example 3G.4. As an easy generalization of the preceding example, replace the group Ð there by a subgroup of Aut—Zp– of order d , where d is any divisor of p − 1 . The new Ð is generated by the automorphism x , m—p−1–=dx , and the same analysis shows that we obtain a space with Zp cohomology ÓZp ƒx2d−1⁄ ⊗ Zpƒy2d⁄ , subscripts again denoting dimension. For a given choice of d the condition that d divides p − 1 says p \u0011 1 mod d , which is satisﬁed by inﬁnitely many p ’s, according to a classical theorem of Dirichlet. Example 3G.5. The two preceding examples can be modiﬁed so as to eliminate the exterior algebra factors, by replacing Zp by Zp1 , the union of the increasing sequence Zp ˆ Zp2 ˆ Zp3 ˆ \u0001\u0001\u0001 . The ﬁrst step is to show that H\u0003—K—Zp1 ; 1–; Zp– ˇ Zpƒ\f⁄ with j\fj… 2 . We know that eH\u0003—K—Zpi ; 1–; Z– consists of Zpi ’s in odd dimensions. The in- clusion Zpi > Zpi‡1 induces a map K—Zpi ; 1–!K—Zpi‡1 ; 1– that is unique up to homo- topy. We can take this map to be a p sheeted covering space since the covering space of a K—Zpi‡1 ; 1– corresponding to the unique index p subgroup of ˇ1K—Zpi‡1 ; 1– is a K—Zpi ; 1– . The homology transfer formula ˇ\u0003˝\u0003 … p shows that the image of the in- duced map Hn—K—Zpi ; 1–; Z–!Hn—K—Zpi‡1 ; 1–; Z– for n odd contains the multiples of p , hence this map is the inclusion Zpi>Zpi‡1 . We can use the universal coefﬁcient the- orem to compute the induced map H\u0003—K—Zpi‡1 ; 1–; Zp–!H\u0003—K—Zpi ; 1–; Zp– . Namely, the inclusion Zpi > Zpi‡1 induces the trivial map Hom—Zpi‡1 ; Zp–!Hom—Zpi ; Zp– ,so on odd-dimensional cohomology the induced map is trivial. On the other hand, the induced map on even-dimensional cohomology is an isomorphism since the map of free resolutions¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! p p pp i iZ ¡¡¡¡¡!Z ¡¡¡¡¡!Z 00 ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! p pi 1 i 1Z ¡¡¡¡¡!Z ¡¡¡¡¡!Z 00 + + 11 dualizes to ¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!pi Z¡¡¡¡¡!Z0 0 0¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!i 10 + 11 Ext(), p p p p pZZExt(), ZZHom(),¡¡¡¡¡!ZZHom(), ¡¡! p p ZZHom(), ZZHom(), Since Zp1 is the union of the increasing sequence of subgroups Zpi , the space BZp1 is the union of the increasing sequence of subcomplexes BZpi . We can therefore apply Transfer Homomorphisms Section 3.G 325 Proposition 3F.5 to conclude that H\u0003—K—Zp1 ; 1–; Zp– is zero in odd dimensions, while in even dimensions the map H\u0003—K—Zp1 ; 1–; Zp–!H\u0003—K—Zp; 1–; Zp– induced by the inclusion Zp > Zp1 is an isomorphism. Thus H\u0003—K—Zp1 ; 1–; Zp– ˇ Zpƒ\f⁄ as claimed. Next we show that the map Aut—Zp1 –!Aut—Zp– obtained by restriction to the subgroup Zp ˆ Zp1 is a split surjection. Automorphisms of Zpi are the maps x,mx for —m; p– … 1 , so the restriction map Aut—Zpi‡1 –!Aut—Zpi – is surjective. Since Aut—Zp1 – … lim -- Aut—Zpi – , the restriction map Aut—Zp1 –!Aut—Zp– is also surjec- tive. The order of Aut—Zpi – , the multiplicative group of invertible elements of Zpi ,is pi − pi−1 … pi−1—p − 1– and p − 1 is relatively prime to pi−1 , so the abelian group Aut—Zpi – contains a subgroup of order p − 1 . This subgroup maps onto the cyclic group Aut—Zp– of the same order, so Aut—Zpi –!Aut—Zp– is a split surjection, hence so is Aut—Zp1 –!Aut—Zp– . Thus we have an action of Ð … Aut—Zp– on BZp1 extending its natural action on BZp . The Borel construction then gives an inclusion BZp \u0002Ð EÐ > BZp1 \u0002Ð EÐ inducing an isomorphism of H\u0003—BZp1 \u0002Ð EÐ ; Zp– onto the even-dimensional part of H\u0003—BZp \u0002Ð EÐ ; Zp– , a polynomial algebra Zpƒy2p−2⁄ . Similarly, if d is any divisor of p − 1 , then taking Ð to be the subgroup of Aut—Zp– of order d yields a space with Zp cohomology the polynomial ring Zpƒy2d⁄ . Example 3G.6. Now we enlarge the preceding example by taking products and bring- ing in the permutation group to produce a space with Zp cohomology the polyno- mial ring Zpƒy2d;y4d; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y2nd⁄ where d is any divisor of p − 1 and p> n . Let X be the product of n copies of BZp1 and let Ð be the group of homeomorphisms of X generated by permutations of the factors together with the actions of Zd in each factor constructed in the preceding example. We can view Ð as a group of n\u0002 n matrices with entries in Zp , the matrices obtained by replacing some of the 1 ’s in a permutation matrix by elements of Zp of multiplicative order a divisor of d . Thus there is a split short exact sequence 0!—Zd– n!Ð!Ön!0 , and the order of Ð is dnn! . The product space X has H\u0003—X; Zp– ˇ Zpƒ\f1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\fn⁄ with j\fij… 2, so H\u0003—X \u0002Ð EÐ ; Zp– ˇ Zpƒ\f1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\fn⁄Ð provided that p does not divide the order of Ð , which means p> n . For a polynomial to be invariant under the Zd action in each factor it must be a polynomial in the powers \fd i , and to be invariant under permutations of the variables it must be a symmetric polynomial in these powers. Since symmetric polynomials are exactly the polynomials in the elementary symmet- ric functions, the polynomials in the \fi ’s invariant under Ð form a polynomial ring Zpƒy2d;y4d; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y2nd⁄ with y2k the sum of all products of k distinct powers \f d i . Example 3G.7. As a further variant on the preceding example, choose a divisor q of d and replace Ð by its subgroup consisting of matrices for which the product of the q th powers of the nonzero entries is 1 . This has the effect of enlarging the ring of polynomials invariant under the action, and it can be shown that the invariant 326 Chapter 3 Cohomology polynomials form a polynomial ring Zpƒy2d;y4d; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y2—n−1–d;y2nq⁄ , with the last generator y2nd replaced by y2nq … Q i \f q i . For example, if n … 2 and q … 1 we obtain Zpƒy4;y2d⁄ with y4 … \f1\f2 and y2d … \f d 1 ‡ \f d 2 . The group Ð in this case happens to be isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 2d . General Remarks The problem of realizing graded polynomial rings Zpƒy⁄ in one variable as cup product rings of spaces was discussed in x3.2, and Example 3G.5 provides the re- maining examples, showing that jyj can be any even divisor of 2—p − 1– . In more variables the problem of realizing Zpƒy1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;yn⁄ with speciﬁed dimensions jyij is more difﬁcult, but has been solved for odd primes p . Here is a sketch of the answer. Assuming that p is odd, the dimensions jyij are even. Call the number di … jyij=2 the degree of yi . In the examples above this was in fact the degree of yi as a polynomial in the 2 dimensional classes \fj invariant under the action of Ð . It was proved in [Dwyer, Miller, & Wilkerson 1992] that every realizable polynomial algebra Zpƒy1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;yn⁄ is the ring of invariant polynomials Zpƒ\f1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\fn⁄Ð for an action of some ﬁnite group Ð on Zpƒ\f1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\fn⁄ , where j\fij… 2 . The basic examples, whose products yield all realizable polynomial algebras, can be divided into two categories. First there are classifying spaces of Lie groups, each of which realizes a polynomial algebra for all but ﬁnitely many primes p . These are listed in the following table. Lie group degrees primes S 1 1 all SU—n– 2; 3; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;n all Sp—n– 2; 4; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 2n all SO—2k– 2; 4; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 2k − 2;k p> 2 G2 2; 6 p> 2 F4 2; 6; 8; 12 p> 3 E6 2; 5; 6; 8; 9; 12 p> 3 E7 2; 6; 8; 10; 12; 14 p> 3 E8 2; 8; 12; 14; 18; 20; 24; 30 p> 5 The remaining examples have to be constructed by hand. They form two inﬁnite families plus 30 sporadic exceptions shown in the table on the next page. The ﬁrst row is the examples we have constructed, though our construction needed the extra condition that p not divide the order of the group Ð . For all entries in both tables the order of Ð , the group such that Zpƒy1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;yn⁄ … Zpƒ\f1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\fn⁄Ð , turns out to equal the product of the degrees. When p does not divide this order, the method we used for the ﬁrst row can also be applied to give examples for all the other rows. In some cases the congruence conditions on p , which are needed in order for Ð to be a subgroup of Aut—Zn p– … GLn—Zp– , automatically imply that p does not divide the order of Ð . But when this is not the case a different construction of a space with the Local Coefﬁcients Section 3.H 327 desired cohomology is needed.

All but the last entry in the table arise from classifying spaces of Lie groups, as described in x4.D. The construction for the last entry is in [Dwyer & Wilkerson 1993]. Homology and cohomology with local coefﬁcients are fancier versions of ordi- nary homology and cohomology that can be deﬁned for nonsimply-connected spaces. In various situations these more reﬁned homology and cohomology theories arise naturally and inevitably. For example, the only way to extend Poincar´e duality with Z coefﬁcients to nonorientable manifolds is to use local coefﬁcients. In the overall scheme of algebraic topology, however, the role played by local coefﬁcients is fairly small. Local coefﬁcients bring an extra level of complication that one tries to avoid whenever possible. With this in mind, the goal of this section will not be to give a full exposition but rather just to sketch the main ideas, leaving the technical details for the interested reader to ﬁll in. 328 Chapter 3 Cohomology The plan for this section is ﬁrst to give the quick algebraic deﬁnition of homology and cohomology with local coefﬁcients, and then to reinterpret this deﬁnition more geometrically in a way that looks more like ordinary homology and cohomology. The reinterpretation also allows the familiar properties of homology and cohomology to be extended to the local coefﬁcient case with very little effort. Local Coefﬁcients via Modules Let X be a path-connected space having a universal cover eX and fundamental group ˇ , so that X is the quotient of eX by the action of ˇ by deck transforma- tions ex , γ ex for γ 2 ˇ and ex 2 eX . The action of ˇ on eX induces an action of ˇ on the group Cn— eX– of singular n chains in eX , by sending a singular n simplex ˙ : Ñn! eX to the composition Ñ n ˙-----! eX γ -----! eX . The action of ˇ on Cn— eX– makes Cn— eX– a module over the group ring Zƒˇ ⁄ , which consists of the ﬁnite formal sums Pi miγi with mi 2 Z and γi 2 ˇ , with the natural addition P i miγi ‡ Pi niγi … Pi —mi ‡ ni–γi and multiplication (P i miγi\u0001(P j njγj\u0001 … P i;j minjγiγj . The bound- ary maps @ : Cn— eX–!Cn−1— eX– are Zƒˇ ⁄ module homomorphisms since the action of ˇ on these groups comes from an action on eX . If M is an arbitrary module over Zƒˇ ⁄ , we would like to deﬁne Cn—X; M– to be Cn— eX– ⊗ Zƒˇ ⁄M , but for tensor products over a noncommutative ring one has to be a little careful with left and right module structures. In general, if R is a ring, possibly noncommutative, one deﬁnes the tensor product A ⊗R B of a right R module A and a left R module B to be the abelian group with generators a ⊗ b for a 2 A and b 2 B , subject to distributivity and associativity relations: (i) —a1 ‡ a2– ⊗ b … a1 ⊗ b ‡ a2 ⊗ b and a ⊗ —b1 ‡ b2– … a ⊗ b1 ‡ a ⊗ b2 . (ii) ar ⊗ b … a ⊗ rb . In case R … Zƒˇ ⁄ , a left Zƒˇ ⁄ module A can be regarded as a right Zƒˇ ⁄ module by setting aγ … γ−1a for γ 2 ˇ . So the tensor product of two left Zƒˇ ⁄ modules A and B is deﬁned, and the relation aγ ⊗ b … a ⊗ γb becomes γ−1a ⊗ b … a ⊗ γb ,or equivalently a0 ⊗ b … γa0 ⊗ γb where a 0 … γ−1a . Thus tensoring over Zƒˇ ⁄ has the effect of factoring out the action of ˇ . To simplify notation we shall write A ⊗Zƒˇ ⁄ B as A ⊗ˇ B , emphasizing the fact that the essential part of a Zƒˇ ⁄ module structure is the action of ˇ . In particular, Cn— eX– ⊗ˇ M is deﬁned if M is a left Zƒˇ ⁄ module. These chain groups Cn—X; M– … Cn— eX– ⊗ˇ M form a chain complex with the boundary maps @ ⊗ 11. The homology groups Hn—X; M– of this chain complex are by deﬁnition homology groups with local coefﬁcients. For cohomology one can set C n—X; M– … HomZƒˇ ⁄—Cn— eX–; M– , the Zƒˇ ⁄ module homomorphisms Cn— eX–!M . These groups C n—X; M– form a cochain complex whose cohomology groups Hn—X; M– are cohomology groups with local coefﬁcients. Local Coefﬁcients Section 3.H 329 Example 3H.1. Let us check that when M is a trivial Zƒˇ ⁄ module, with γm … m for all γ 2 ˇ and m 2 M , then Hn—X; M– is just ordinary homology with coefﬁcients in the abelian group M . For a singular n simplex ˙ : Ñ n!X , the various lifts e˙ : Ñ n! eX form an orbit of the action of ˇ on Cn— eX– .In Cn— eX– ⊗ˇ M all these lifts are identi- ﬁed via the relation e˙ ⊗ m … γ e˙ ⊗ γm … γ e˙ ⊗ m . Thus we can identify Cn— eX– ⊗ˇ M with Cn—X– ⊗ M , the chain group denoted Cn—X; M– in ordinary homology theory, so Hn—X; M– reduces to ordinary homology with coefﬁcients in M . The analogous state- ment for cohomology is also true since elements of HomZƒˇ ⁄—Cn— eX–; M– are functions from singular n simplices e˙ : Ñ n! eX to M taking the same value on all elements of a ˇ orbit since the action of ˇ on M is trivial, so HomZƒˇ ⁄—Cn— eX–; M– is identiﬁable with Hom—Cn—X–; M– , ordinary cochains with coefﬁcients in M . Example 3H.2. Suppose we take M … Zƒˇ ⁄ , viewed as a module over itself via its ring structure. For a ring R with identity element, A ⊗R R is naturally isomorphic to A via the correspondence a ⊗ r , ar . So we have a natural identiﬁcation of Cn— eX– ⊗ˇ Zƒˇ ⁄ with Cn— eX– , and hence an isomorphism Hn—X; Zƒˇ ⁄– ˇ Hn— eX– . Gen- eralizing this, let X0!X be the cover corresponding to a subgroup ˇ 0 ˆ ˇ . Then the free abelian group Zƒˇ =ˇ 0⁄ with basis the cosets γˇ 0 is a Zƒˇ ⁄ module and Cn— eX– ⊗Zƒˇ ⁄ Zƒˇ =ˇ 0⁄ ˇ Cn—X0– ,so Hn—X; Zƒˇ =ˇ 0⁄– ˇ Hn—X0– . More generally, if A is an abelian group then Aƒˇ =ˇ 0⁄ is a Zƒˇ ⁄ module and Hn—X; Aƒˇ =ˇ 0⁄– ˇ Hn—X0; A– . So homology of covering spaces is a special case of homology with local coefﬁcients. The corresponding assertions for cohomology are not true, however, as we shall see later in the section. For a Zƒˇ ⁄ module M , let ˇ 0 be the kernel of the homomorphism ˆ : ˇ!Aut—M– deﬁning the module structure, given by ˆ—γ–—m– … γm , where Aut—M– is the group of automorphisms of the abelian group M .If X0!X is the cover corresponding to the normal subgroup ˇ 0 of ˇ , then Cn— eX– ⊗ˇ M ˇ Cn—X0– ⊗ˇ M ˇ Cn—X0– ⊗Zƒˇ =ˇ 0⁄ M . This gives a more efﬁcient description of Hn—X; M– . Example 3H.3. As a special case, suppose that we take M … Z , so Aut—Z– ˇ Z2 …f\u00061g . For a nontrivial Zƒˇ ⁄ module structure on M , ˇ 0 is a subgroup of index 2 and X0!X is a 2 sheeted covering space. If ˝ is the nontrivial deck transformation of X0 , let C ‡ n —X0– …f\u000b 2 Cn—X0– j ˝]—\u000b– … \u000bg and C − n —X0– …f\u000b 2 Cn—X0– j ˝]—\u000b– …−\u000bg .It follows easily that C \u0006 n —X0– has basis the chains ˙ \u0006 ˝˙ for ˙ : Ñ n!X0 , and we have short exact sequences 0 -! C − n —X0– > Cn—X0– Ö-----! C ‡ n —X0– -! 0 0 -! C ‡ n —X0– > Cn—X0– Ñ-----! C − n —X0– -! 0 where Ö—\u000b– … \u000b‡˝]—\u000b– and Ñ—\u000b– … \u000b−˝]—\u000b– . The homomorphism Cn—X–!C ‡ n —X0– sending a singular simplex in X to the sum of its two lifts to X0 is an isomorphism. The quotient map Cn—X0–!Cn—X0– ⊗ˇ Z has kernel C ‡ n —X0– , so the second short ex- act sequence gives an isomorphism C − n —X0– ˇ Cn—X0– ⊗ˇ Z . These isomorphisms are 330 Chapter 3 Cohomology isomorphisms of chain complexes and the short exact sequences are short exact se- quence of chain complexes, so from the ﬁrst short exact sequence we get a long exact sequence of homology groups \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Hn—X; eZ– -! Hn—X0– p\u0003---------! Hn—X– -! Hn−1—X; eZ– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 where the symbol eZ indicates local coefﬁcients in the module Z and p\u0003 is induced by the covering projection p : X0!X . Let us apply this exact sequence when X is a nonorientable n manifold M which is closed and connected. We shall use terminology and notation from x3.3. We can view Z as a Zƒˇ1M⁄ module by letting a loop γ in M act on Z by multiplication by ‡1or −1 according to whether γ preserves or reverses local orientations of M . The double cover X0!X is then the 2 sheeted cover fM!M with fM orientable. The nonorientability of M implies that Hn—M– … 0 . Since Hn‡1—M– … 0 , the exact se- quence above then gives Hn—M; eZ– ˇ Hn—fM– ˇ Z . This can be interpreted as saying that by taking homology with local coefﬁcients we obtain a fundamental class for a nonorientable manifold. Local Coefﬁcients via Bundles of Groups Now we wish to reinterpret homology and cohomology with local coefﬁcients in more geometric terms, making it look more like ordinary homology and cohomology. Let us ﬁrst deﬁne a special kind of covering space with extra algebraic structure. A bundle of groups is a map p : E!X together with a group structure on each subset p−1—x– , such that all these groups p−1—x– are isomorphic to a ﬁxed group G in the following special way: Each point of X has a neighborhood U for which there exists a homeomorphism hU : p−1—U–!U \u0002 G taking each p−1—x– to fxg\u0002 G by a group isomorphism. Since G is given the discrete topology, the projection p is a covering space. Borrowing terminology from the theory of ﬁber bundles, the subsets p−1—x– are called the ﬁbers of p : E!X , and one speaks of E as a bundle of groups with ﬁber G . It may be worth remarking that if we modify the deﬁnition by replacing the word ‘group’ with ‘vector space’ throughout, then we obtain the much more common notion of a vector bundle; see [VBKT]. Trivial examples are provided by products E … X \u0002 G . Nontrivial examples we have considered are the covering spaces MZ!M of nonorientable manifolds M de- ﬁned in x3.3. Here the group G is the homology coefﬁcient group Z , though one could equally well deﬁne a bundle of groups MG!M for any abelian coefﬁcient group G . Homology groups of X with coefﬁcients in a bundle E of abelian groups may be deﬁned as follows. Consider ﬁnite sums P i ni˙i where each ˙i : Ñ n!X is a sin- gular n simplex in X and ni : Ñ n!E is a lifting of ˙i . The sum of two lifts ni and mi of the same ˙i is deﬁned by —ni ‡ mi–—s– … ni—s– ‡ mi—s– , and is also a lift of ˙i . In this way the ﬁnite sums P i ni˙i form an abelian group Cn—X; E– , pro- vided we allow the deletion of terms ni˙i when ni is the zero-valued lift. A bound- Local Coefﬁcients Section 3.H 331 ary homomorphism @ : Cn—X; E–!Cn−1—X; E– is deﬁned by the formula @(P i ni˙i\u0001 … Pi;j—−1– jni˙i jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvj; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ where ‘ ni ’ in the right side of the equation means the restricted lifting ni jj ƒv0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; bvj; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn⁄ . The proof that the usual boundary ho- momorphism @ satisﬁes @2 … 0 still works in the present context, so the groups Cn—X; E– form a chain complex. We denote the homology groups of this chain com- plex by Hn—X; E– . In case E is the product bundle X \u0002 G , lifts ni are simply elements of G ,so Hn—X; E– … Hn—X; G– , ordinary homology. In the general case, lifts ni : Ñ n!E are uniquely determined by their value at one point s 2 Ñn , and these values can be speciﬁed arbitrarily since Ñn is simply-connected, so the ni ’s can be thought of as elements of p−1—˙i—s–– , a group isomorphic to G . However if E is not a product, there is no canonical isomorphism between different ﬁbers p−1—x– , so one cannot identify Hn—X; E– with ordinary homology. An alternative approach would be to take the coefﬁcients ni to be elements of the ﬁber group over a speciﬁc point of ˙i—Ñ n– , say ˙i—v0– . However, with such a deﬁnition the formula for the boundary operator @ becomes more complicated since there is no point of Ñn that lies in all the faces. Our task now is to relate the homology groups Hn—X; E– to homology groups with coefﬁcients in a module, as deﬁned earlier. In x1.3 we described how covering spaces of X with a given ﬁber F can be classiﬁed in terms of actions of ˇ1—X– on F , assuming X is path-connected and has the local properties guaranteeing the existence of a universal cover. It is easy to check that covering spaces that are bundles of groups with ﬁber a group G are equivalent to actions of ˇ1—X– on G by automorphisms of G , that is, homomorphisms from ˇ1—X– to Aut—G– . For example, for the bundle MZ!M the action of a loop γ on the ﬁber Z is multiplication by \u00061 according to whether γ preserves or reverses orientation in M , that is, whether γ lifts to a closed loop in the orientable double cover fM!M or not. As another example, the action of ˇ1—X– on itself by inner automorphisms corresponds to a bundle of groups p : E!X with ﬁbers p−1—x– … ˇ1—X; x– . This example is rather similar in spirit to the examples MZ!M . In both cases one has a functor associating a group to each point of a space, and all the groups at different points are isomorphic, but not canonically so. Different choices of isomorphisms are obtained by choosing different paths between two points, and loops give rise to an action of ˇ1 on the ﬁbers. In the case of bundles of groups p : E!X whose ﬁber G is abelian, an action of ˇ1—X– on G by automorphisms is the same as a Zƒˇ1X⁄ module structure on G . Proposition 3H.4. If X is a path-connected space having a universal covering space, then the groups Hn—X; E– are naturally isomorphic to the homology groups Hn—X; G– with local coefﬁcients in the Zƒˇ ⁄ module G associated to E , where ˇ … ˇ1—X– . 332 Chapter 3 Cohomology Proof: As noted earlier, a bundle of groups E!X with ﬁber G is equivalent to an action of ˇ on G . In more explicit terms this means that if eX is the universal cover of X , then E is identiﬁable with the quotient of eX \u0002 G by the diagonal action of ˇ , γ— ex; g– … —γ ex; γg– where the action in the ﬁrst coordinate is by deck trans- formations of eX . For a chain P i ni˙i 2 Cn—X; E– , the coefﬁcient ni gives a lift of ˙i to E , and ni in turn has various lifts to eX \u0002 G . Thus we have natural surjec- tions Cn— eX \u0002 G–!Cn—E–!Cn—X; E– expressing each of these groups as a quotient of the preceding one. More precisely, identifying Cn— eX \u0002 G– with Cn— eX– ⊗ ZƒG⁄ in the obvious way, then Cn—E– is the quotient of Cn— eX– ⊗ ZƒG⁄ under the identiﬁcations e˙ ⊗ g ˘ γ e˙ ⊗ γ g . This quotient is the tensor product Cn— eX– ⊗ˇ ZƒG⁄ . To pass to the quotient Cn—X; E– of Cn—E– … Cn— eX– ⊗ˇ ZƒG⁄ we need to take into account the sum operation in Cn—X; E– , addition of lifts ni : Ñ n!E . This means that in sums e˙ ⊗ g1 ‡ e˙ ⊗ g2 … e˙ ⊗ —g1 ‡ g2– , the term g1 ‡ g2 should be interpreted not in ZƒG⁄ but in the natural quotient G of ZƒG⁄ . Hence Cn—X; E– is identiﬁed with the quo- tient Cn— eX– ⊗ˇ G of Cn— eX– ⊗ˇ ZƒG⁄ . This natural identiﬁcation commutes with the boundary homomorphisms, so the homology groups are also identiﬁed. tu More generally, if X has a number of path-components X\u000b with universal covers eX\u000b , then Cn—X; E– … L \u000b ( Cn— eX\u000b– ⊗Zƒˇ1—X\u000b–⁄ G\u0001 ,so Hn—X; E– splits accordingly as a direct sum of the local coefﬁcient homology groups for the path-components X\u000b . We turn now to the question of whether homology with local coefﬁcients satisﬁes axioms similar to those for ordinary homology. The main novelty is with the behav- ior of induced homomorphisms. In order for a map f : X!X0 to induce a map on homology with local coefﬁcients we must have bundles of groups E!X and E0!X0 that are related in some way. The natural assumption to make is that there is a com- mutative diagram as at the right, such that ef restricts to a homo-¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! E p f f p XX E 0 0 0 » morphism in each ﬁber. With this hypothesis there is then a chain homomorphism f] : Cn—X; E–!Cn—X0; E0– obtained by composing singular simplices with f and their lifts with ef , hence there is an in- duced homomorphism f\u0003 : Hn—X; E–!Hn—X0; E0– . The ﬁbers of E and E0 need not be isomorphic groups, so change-of-coefﬁcient homomorphisms Hn—X; G1–!Hn—X; G2– for ordinary homology are a special case. To avoid this extra complication we shall consider only the case that ef restricts to an isomorphism on each ﬁber. With this condition, a commutative diagram as above will be called a bundle map. Here is a method for constructing bundle maps. Starting with a map f : X!X0 and a bundle of groups p0 : E0!X0 , let E … \b —x; e0– 2 X \u0002 E0 jjjj f—x– … p0—e0– }: This ﬁts into a commutative diagram as above if we deﬁne p—x; e0– … x and ef—x; e0– … e0 . In particular, the ﬁber p−1—x– consists of pairs —x; e0– with p0—e0– … f—x– ,so ef is a bijection of this ﬁber with the ﬁber of E0!X0 over f—x– . We use this bijection Local Coefﬁcients Section 3.H 333 to give p−1—x– a group structure. To check that p : E!X is a bundle of groups, let h0 : —p0– −1—U 0–!U 0 \u0002 G be an isomorphism as in the deﬁnition of a bundle of groups. Deﬁne h : p−1—U–!U \u0002 G over U … f −1—U 0– by h—x; e0– … —x; h0 2—e0–– where h0 2 is the second coordinate of h0 . An inverse for h is —x; g– 2 —x; —h 0–−1—f —x–; g–– , and h is clearly an isomorphism on each ﬁber. Thus p : E!X is a bundle of groups, called the pullback of E0!X0 via f , or the induced bundle. The notation f \u0003—E0– is often used for the pullback bundle. Given any bundle map E!E0 as in the diagram above, it is routine to check that the map E!f \u0003—E0– , e , —p—e–; ef—e–– , is an isomorphism of bundles over X , so the pullback construction produces all bundle maps. Thus we see one reason why homology with local coefﬁcients is somewhat complicated: Hn—X; E– is really a functor of two variables, covariant in X and contravariant in E . Viewing bundles of groups over X as Zƒˇ1X⁄ modules, the pullback construc- tion corresponds to making a Zƒˇ1X0⁄ module into a Zƒˇ1X⁄ module by deﬁning γg … f\u0003—γ–g for f\u0003 : ˇ1—X–!ˇ1—X0– . This follows easily from the deﬁnitions. In particular, this implies that homotopic maps f0;f1 : X!X0 induce isomorphic pull- back bundles f \u0003 0 —E0–; f \u0003 1 —E0– . Hence the map f\u0003 : Hn—X; E–!Hn—X0; E0– induced by a bundle map depends only on the homotopy class of f . Generalizing the deﬁnition of Hn—X; E– to pairs —X; A– is straightforward, starting with the deﬁnition of Hn—X; A; E– as the n th homology group of the chain complex of quotients Cn—X; E–=Cn—A; E– where p : E!X becomes a bundle of groups over A by restriction to p−1—A– . Associated to the pair —X; A– there is then a long exact sequence of homology groups with local coefﬁcients in the bundle E . The excision property is proved just as for ordinary homology, via iterated barycentric subdivision. The ﬁnal axiom for homology, involving disjoint unions, extends trivially to homology with local coefﬁcients. Simplicial and cellular homology also extend without difﬁculty to the case of local coefﬁcients, as do the proofs that these forms of homology agree with singular homology for Ñ complexes and CW complexes, respectively. We leave the veriﬁcations of all these statements to the energetic reader. Now we turn to cohomology. One might try deﬁning Hn—X; E– by simply dual- izing, taking Hom—Cn—X–; E– , but this makes no sense since E is not a group. In- stead, the cochain group C n—X; E– is deﬁned to consist of all functions ' assigning to each singular simplex ˙ : Ñ n!X a lift '—˙ – : Ñ n!E . In case E is the product X \u0002 G , this amounts to assigning an element of G to each ˙ , so this deﬁnition gen- eralizes ordinary cohomology. Coboundary maps \u000e : C n—X; E–!C n‡1—X; E– are de- ﬁned just as with ordinary cohomology, and satisfy \u000e 2 … 0 , so we have cohomology groups Hn—X; E– , and in the relative case, Hn—X; A; E– , deﬁned via relative cochains C n—X; A; E– … Ker ( C n—X; E–!C n—A; E–\u0001 . For a path-connected space X with universal cover eX and fundamental group ˇ , we can identify Hn—X; E– with Hn—X; G– , cohomology with local coefﬁcients in the 334 Chapter 3 Cohomology Zƒˇ ⁄ module G corresponding to E , by identifying C n—X; E– with HomZƒˇ ⁄—Cn— eX–; G– in the following way. An element ' 2 C n—X; E– assigns to each ˙ : Ñ n!X a lift to E . Regarding E as the quotient of eX \u0002 G under the diagonal action of ˇ , a lift of ˙ to E is the same as an orbit of a lift to eX \u0002 G . Such an orbit is a function f assigning to each lift e˙ : Ñ n! eX an element f— e˙– 2 G such that f—γ e˙– … γf — e˙– for all γ 2 G , that is, an element of HomZƒˇ ⁄—Cn— eX–; G– . The basic properties of ordinary cohomology in x3.1 extend without great dif- ﬁculty to cohomology groups with local coefﬁcients. In order to deﬁne the map f \u0003 : Hn—X0; E0–!Hn—X; E– induced by a bundle map as before, it sufﬁces to observe that a singular simplex ˙ : Ñ n!X and a lift e˙ 0 : Ñ n!E0 of f˙ deﬁne a lift e˙ … —˙ ; e˙ 0– : Ñ n!f \u0003—E– of ˙ . To show that f ' g implies f \u0003 … g\u0003 requires some mod- iﬁcation of the proof of the corresponding result for ordinary cohomology in x3.1, which proceeded by dualizing the proof for homology. In the local coefﬁcient case one constructs a chain homotopy P \u0003 satisfying g] −f ] … P \u0003\u000e‡\u000eP \u0003 directly from the subdivision of Ñn \u0002 I used in the proof of the homology result. Similar remarks apply to proving excision and Mayer–Vietoris sequences for cohomology with local coefﬁ- cients. To prove the equivalence of simplicial and cellular cohomology with singular cohomology in the local coefﬁcient context, one should use the telescope argument from the proof of Lemma 2.34 to show that Hn—Xk; E– ˇ Hn—X; E– for k>n . Once again details will be left to the reader. The difference between homology with local coefﬁcients and cohomology with lo- cal coefﬁcients is illuminated by comparing the following proposition with our earlier identiﬁcation of H\u0003—X; Zƒˇ1X⁄– with the ordinary homology of the universal cover of X . Proposition 3H.5. If X is a ﬁnite CW complex with universal cover eX and funda- mental group ˇ , then for all n , Hn—X; Zƒˇ ⁄– is isomorphic to Hn c — eX; Z– , cohomology of eX with compact supports and ordinary integer coefﬁcients. For example, consider the n dimensional torus T n , the product of n circles, with fundamental group ˇ … Zn and universal cover R n . We have Hi—T n; Zƒˇ ⁄– ˇ Hi—R n– , which is zero except for a Z in dimension 0 , but Hi—T n; Zƒˇ ⁄– ˇ Hi c—R n– vanishes except for a Z in dimension n , as we saw in Example 3.34. To prove the proposition we shall use a few general facts about cohomology with compact supports. One signiﬁcant difference between ordinary cohomology and cohomology with compact supports is in induced maps. A map f : X!Y in- duces f ] : C n c —Y ; G–!C n c —X; G– and hence f \u0003 : Hn c —Y ; G–!Hn c —X; G– provided that f is proper: The preimage f −1—K– of each compact set K in Y is compact in X . Thus if ' 2 C n—Y ; G– vanishes on chains in Y − K then f ]—'– 2 C n—X; G– vanishes on chains in X − f −1—K– . Further, to guarantee that f ' g implies f \u0003 … g\u0003 we should restrict attention to homotopies that are proper as maps X \u0002 I!Y . Relative groups Local Coefﬁcients Section 3.H 335 Hn c —X; A; G– are deﬁned when A is a closed subset of X , which guarantees that the inclusion A > X is a proper map. With these constraints the basic theory of x3.1 translates without difﬁculty to cohomology with compact supports. In particular, for a locally compact CW complex X one can compute H\u0003 c —X; G– using ﬁnite cellular cochains, the cellular cochains vanishing on all but ﬁnitely many cells. Namely, to compute Hn c —Xn;Xn−1; G– using excision one ﬁrst has to identify this group with Hn c —Xn;N—Xn−1–; G– where N—Xn−1– is a closed neighborhood of Xn−1 in Xn obtained by deleting an open n disk from the interior of each n cell. If X is locally compact, the obvious deformation retraction of N—Xn−1– onto Xn−1 is a proper homotopy equivalence. Hence via long exact sequences and the ﬁve-lemma we obtain isomorphisms Hn c —Xn;Xn−1; G– ˇ Hn c —Xn;N—Xn−1–; G– , and by excision the latter group can be identiﬁed with the ﬁnite cochains. Proof of 3H.5: As noted above, we can compute H\u0003 c — eX; Z– using the groups C n f — eX; Z– of ﬁnite cellular cochains ' : Cn!Z , where Cn … Hn— eXn; eXn−1– . Giving eX the CW structure lifting the CW structure on X , then since X is compact, ﬁnite cellular cochains are exactly homomorphisms ' : Cn!Z such that for each cell en of eX , '—γen– is nonzero for only ﬁnitely many covering transformations γ 2 ˇ . Such a ' determines a map b' : Cn!Zƒˇ ⁄ by setting b'—en– … P γ '—γ−1en–γ . The map b' is a Zƒˇ ⁄ homomorphism since if we replace the summation index γ in the right side of '—\u0011en– … Pγ '—γ−1\u0011en–γ by \u0011γ , we get P γ '—γ−1en–\u0011γ . The function ' , b' deﬁnes a homomorphism C n f — eX; Z–!HomZƒˇ ⁄—Cn; Zƒˇ ⁄– which is injective since ' is recoverable from b' as the coefﬁcient of γ … 1 . Furthermore, this ho- momorphism is surjective since a Zƒˇ ⁄ homomorphism : M!Zƒˇ ⁄ has the form —x– … Pγ γ—x–γ with γ 2 HomZ—M; Z– satisfying γ—x– … 1—γ−1x– ,so 1 de- termines . The isomorphisms C n f — eX; Z– ˇ HomZƒˇ ⁄—Cn; Zƒˇ ⁄– are isomorphisms of cochain complexes, so the respective cohomology groups Hn c — eX; Z– and Hn—X; Zƒˇ ⁄– are isomorphic. tu Cup and cap product work easily with local coefﬁcients in a bundle of rings, the latter concept being deﬁned in the obvious way. The cap product can be used to give a version of Poincar´e duality for a closed n manifold M using coefﬁcients in a bundle of rings E under the same assumption as with ordinary coefﬁcients that there exists a fundamental class ƒM⁄ 2 Hn—M; E– restricting to a generator of Hn—M; M −fxg; E– for all x 2 M . By excision the latter group is isomorphic to the ﬁber ring R of E . The same proof as for ordinary coefﬁcients then shows that ƒM⁄a : Hk—M; E–!Hn−k—M; E– is an isomorphism for all k . Taking R to be one of the standard rings Z , Q ,or Zp does not give anything new since the only ring automorphism these rings have is the identity, so the bundle of rings E must be the product M \u0002 R . To get something more interesting, suppose we take R to be the ring Zƒi⁄ of Gaussian integers, the complex numbers a ‡ bi with 336 Chapter 3 Cohomology a; b 2 Z . This has complex conjugation a ‡ bi , a − bi as a ring isomorphism. If M is nonorientable and connected we can use the homomorphism ! : ˇ1—M–!f\u00061g that deﬁnes the bundle of groups MZ to build a bundle of rings E corresponding to the action of ˇ1—M– on Zƒi⁄ given by γ—a ‡ bi– … a ‡ !—γ–bi . The homology and cohomology groups of M with coefﬁcients in E depend only on the additive structure of Zƒi⁄ so they split as the direct sum of their real and imaginary parts, which are just the homology or cohomology groups with ordinary coefﬁcients Z and twisted coefﬁcients eZ , respectively. The fundamental class in Hn—M; eZ– constructed in Exam- ple 3H.3 can be viewed as a pure imaginary fundamental class ƒM⁄ 2 Hn—M; E– . Since cap product with ƒM⁄ interchanges real and imaginary parts, we obtain: Theorem 3H.6. If M is a nonorientable closed connected n manifold then cap prod- uct with the pure imaginary fundamental class ƒM⁄ gives isomorphisms Hk—M; Z– ˇ Hn−k—M; eZ– and Hk—M; eZ– ˇ Hn−k—M; Z– . tu More generally this holds with Z replaced by other rings such as Q or Zp . There is also a version for noncompact manifolds using cohomology with compact supports. Exercises 1. Compute H\u0003—S 1; E– and H\u0003—S 1; E– for E!S 1 the nontrivial bundle with ﬁber Z . 2.

Show that homology groups H`f n —X; G– can be deﬁned using locally ﬁnite chains, which are formal sums P ˙ g˙ ˙ of singular simplices ˙ : Ñ n!X with coefﬁcients g˙ 2 G , such that each x 2 X has a neighborhood meeting the images of only ﬁnitely many ˙ ’s with g˙ ﬂ 0 . Develop this homology theory far enough to show that for a locally compact CW complex X , H`f n —X; G– can be computed using inﬁnite cellular chains P\u000b g\u000ben \u000b . Homotopy theory begins with the homotopy groups ˇn—X– , which are the nat- ural higher-dimensional analogs of the fundamental group. These higher homotopy groups have certain formal similarities with homology groups. For example, ˇn—X– turns out to be always abelian for n \u0015 2 , and there are relative homotopy groups ﬁt- ting into a long exact sequence just like the long exact sequence of homology groups. However, the higher homotopy groups are much harder to compute than either ho- mology groups or the fundamental group, due to the fact that neither the excision property for homology nor van Kampen’s theorem for ˇ1 holds for higher homotopy groups. In spite of these computational difﬁculties, homotopy groups are of great theo- retical signiﬁcance. One reason for this is Whitehead’s theorem that a map between CW complexes which induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups is a homotopy equivalence. The stronger statement that two CW complexes with isomorphic homo- topy groups are homotopy equivalent is usually false, however. One of the rare cases when a CW complex does have its homotopy type uniquely determined by its homo- topy groups is when it has just a single nontrivial homotopy group. Such spaces, known as Eilenberg–MacLane spaces, turn out to play a fundamental role in algebraic topology for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the most important is their close connec- tion with cohomology: Cohomology classes in a CW complex correspond bijectively with homotopy classes of maps from the complex into an Eilenberg–MacLane space. 338 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Thus cohomology has a strictly homotopy-theoretic interpretation, and there is an analogous but more subtle homotopy-theoretic interpretation of homology, explained in x4.F. A more elementary and direct connection between homotopy and homology is the Hurewicz theorem, asserting that the ﬁrst nonzero homotopy group ˇn—X– of a simply-connected space X is isomorphic to the ﬁrst nonzero homology group eHn—X– . This result, along with its relative version, is one of the cornerstones of algebraic topology. Though the excision property does not always hold for homotopy groups, in some important special cases there is a range of dimensions in which it does hold. This leads to the idea of stable homotopy groups, the beginning of stable homotopy theory. Perhaps the major unsolved problem in algebraic topology is the computation of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. Near the end of x4.2 we give some tables of known calculations that show quite clearly the complexity of the problem. Included in x4.2 is a brief introduction to ﬁber bundles, which generalize covering spaces and play a somewhat analogous role for higher homotopy groups. It would easily be possible to devote a whole book to the subject of ﬁber bundles, even the special case of vector bundles, but here we use ﬁber bundles only to provide a few basic examples and to motivate their more ﬂexible homotopy-theoretic generalization, ﬁbrations, which play a large role in x4.3. Among other things, ﬁbrations allow one to describe, in theory at least, how the homotopy type of an arbitrary CW complex is built up from its homotopy groups by an inductive procedure of forming ‘twisted products’ of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces. This is the notion of a Postnikov tower. In favorable cases, including all simply-connected CW complexes, the additional data beyond homotopy groups needed to determine a homotopy type can also be described, in the form of a sequence of cohomology classes called the k invariants of a space. If these are all zero, the space is homotopy equivalent to a product of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces, and otherwise not. Unfortunately the k invariants are cohomology classes in rather complicated spaces in general, so this is not a practical way of classifying homotopy types, but it is useful for various more theoretical purposes. This chapter is arranged so that it begins with purely homotopy-theoretic notions, largely independent of homology and cohomology theory, whose roles gradually in- crease in later sections of the chapter. It should therefore be possible to read a good portion of this chapter immediately after reading Chapter 1, with just an occasional glimpse at Chapter 2 for algebraic deﬁnitions, particularly the notion of an exact se- quence which is just as important in homotopy theory as in homology and cohomology theory. Homotopy Groups Section 4.1 339 Perhaps the simplest noncontractible spaces are spheres, so to get a glimpse of the subtlety inherent in homotopy groups let us look at some of the calculations of the groups ˇi—S n– that have been made. A small sample is shown in the table below, extracted from [Toda 1962]. ˇi—S n– i -! 1234 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 n 1 Z 0 0 000 0 0 0 0 0 0 # 2 0 ZZZ2 Z2 Z12 Z2 Z2 Z3 Z15 Z2 Z2 \u0002 Z2 3 00 ZZ2 Z2 Z12 Z2 Z2 Z3 Z15 Z2 Z2 \u0002 Z2 4 000 ZZ2 Z2 Z \u0002 Z12 Z2 \u0002 Z2 Z2 \u0002 Z2 Z24 \u0002 Z3 Z15 Z2 5 0000 ZZ2 Z2 Z24 Z2 Z2 Z2 Z30 6 0000 0 ZZ2 Z2 Z24 0 ZZ2 7 0000 0 0 ZZ2 Z2 Z24 00 8 0000 0 0 0 ZZ2 Z2 Z24 0 This is an intriguing mixture of pattern and chaos. The most obvious feature is the large region of zeros below the diagonal, and indeed ˇi—S n– … 0 for all i<n as we show in Corollary 4.9. There is also the sequence of zeros in the ﬁrst row, suggesting that ˇi—S 1– … 0 for all i> 1 . This too is a fairly elementary fact, a special case of Proposition 4.1, following easily from covering space theory. The coincidences in the second and third rows can hardly be overlooked. These are the case n … 1 of isomorphisms ˇi—S 2n– ˇ ˇi−1—S 2n−1–\u0002 ˇi—S 4n−1– that hold for n … 1; 2; 4 and all i . The next case n … 2 says that each entry in the fourth row is the product of the entry diagonally above it to the left and the entry three units below it. Actually, these isomorphisms ˇi—S 2n– ˇ ˇi−1—S 2n−1–\u0002 ˇi—S 4n−1– hold for all n if one factors out 2 torsion, the elements of order a power of 2 . This is a theorem of James that will be proved in [SSAT]. The next regular feature in the table is the sequence of Z ’s down the diagonal. This is an illustration of the Hurewicz theorem, which asserts that for a simply-connected space X , the ﬁrst nonzero homotopy group ˇn—X– is isomorphic to the ﬁrst nonzero homology group Hn—X– . One may observe that all the groups above the diagonal are ﬁnite except for ˇ3—S 2– , ˇ7—S 4– , and ˇ11—S 6– .In x4.C we use cup products in cohomology to show that ˇ4k−1—S 2k– contains a Z direct summand for all k \u0015 1 . It is a theorem of Serre proved in [SSAT] that ˇi—S n– is ﬁnite for i>n except for ˇ4k−1—S 2k– , which is the direct sum of Z with a ﬁnite group. So all the complexity of the homotopy groups of spheres resides in ﬁnite abelian groups. The problem thus reduces to computing the p torsion in ˇi—S n– for each prime p . 340 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory An especially interesting feature of the table is that along each diagonal the groups ˇn‡k—S n– with k ﬁxed and varying n eventually become independent of n for large enough n . This stability property is the Freudenthal suspension theorem, proved in x4.2 where we give more extensive tables of these stable homotopy groups of spheres. Deﬁnitions and Basic Constructions Let In be the n dimensional unit cube, the product of n copies of the interval ƒ0; 1⁄ . The boundary @In of In is the subspace consisting of points with at least one coordinate equal to 0 or 1 . For a space X with basepoint x0 2 X , deﬁne ˇn—X; x0– to be the set of homotopy classes of maps f : —In;@In–!—X; x0– , where homotopies ft are required to satisfy ft—@In– … x0 for all t . The deﬁnition extends to the case n … 0 by taking I0 to be a point and @I0 to be empty, so ˇ0—X; x0– is just the set of path-components of X . When n \u0015 2 , a sum operation in ˇn—X; x0– , generalizing the composition opera- tion in ˇ1 , is deﬁned by —f ‡ g–—s1;s2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;sn– … ˆ f—2s1;s2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;sn–; s1 2 ƒ0; 1=2⁄ g—2s1 − 1;s2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;sn–; s1 2 ƒ1=2; 1⁄ It is evident that this sum is well-deﬁned on homotopy classes. Since only the ﬁrst coordinate is involved in the sum operation, the same arguments as for ˇ1 show that ˇn—X; x0– is a group, with identity element the constant map sending In to x0 and with inverses given by −f—s1;s2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;sn– … f—1 − s1;s2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;sn– . The additive notation for the group operation is used because ˇn—X; x0– is abelian for n \u0015 2 . Namely, f ‡ g ' g ‡ f via the homotopy indicated in the following ﬁgures. f g f g f g fg'' fg'' The homotopy begins by shrinking the domains of f and g to smaller subcubes of In , with the region outside these subcubes mapping to the basepoint. After this has been done, there is room to slide the two subcubes around anywhere in In as long as they stay disjoint, so if n \u0015 2 they can be slid past each other, interchanging their positions. Then to ﬁnish the homotopy, the domains of f and g can be enlarged back to their original size. If one likes, the whole process can be done using just the coordinates s1 and s2 , keeping the other coordinates ﬁxed. Maps —In;@In–!—X; x0– are the same as maps of the quotient In=@In … S n to X taking the basepoint s0 … @In=@In to x0 . This means that we can also view ˇn—X; x0– as homotopy classes of maps —S n;s0–!—X; x0– , where homotopies are through maps Homotopy Groups Section 4.1 341 of the same form —S n;s0–!—X; x0– . In this interpretation of ˇn—X; x0– , the sum f ‡ g is the composition S n c-----! S n _ S n f _g ------------! X X g f c¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! where c collapses the equator S n−1 in S n to a point and we choose the basepoint s0 to lie in this S n−1 . We will show next that if X is path-connected, different choices of the base- point x0 always produce isomorphic groups ˇn—X; x0– , just as for ˇ1 , so one is justiﬁed in writing ˇn—X– for ˇn—X; x0– in these cases. Given a path γ : I!X from x0 … γ—0– to another basepoint x1 … γ—1– , we may associate to each map f : —In;@In–!—X; x1– a new map γf : —In;@In–!—X; x0– by shrinking the domain of f to a smaller fx1 x1 x1 x1 x0 x0 x0 x0 concentric cube in In , then inserting the path γ on each radial segment in the shell between this smaller cube and @In . When n … 1 the map γf is the composition of the three paths γ , f , and the inverse of γ , so the notation γf conﬂicts with the notation for composition of paths. Since we are mainly interested in the cases n> 1 , we leave it to the reader to make the necessary notational adjustments when n … 1. A homotopy of γ or f through maps ﬁxing @I or @In , respectively, yields a homo- topy of γf through maps —In;@In–!—X; x0– . Here are three other basic properties: (1) γ—f ‡ g– ' γf ‡ γg . (2) —γ\u0011–f ' γ—\u0011f – . (3) 1f ' f , where 1 denotes the constant path. The homotopies in (2) and (3) are obvious. For (1), we ﬁrst deform f and g to be constant on the right and left halves of In , respectively, producing maps we may call f ‡ 0 and 0 ‡ g , then we excise a progressively wider symmetric middle slab of γ—f ‡ 0– ‡ γ—0 ‡ g– until it becomes γ—f ‡ g– : f f fgg gx 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 '' An explicit formula for this homotopy is ht—s1;s2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;sn– … ˆ γ—f ‡ 0–( —2 − t–s1;s2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;sn\u0001 ;s1 2 ƒ0; 1=2⁄ γ—0 ‡ g– ( —2 − t–s1 ‡ t − 1;s2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;sn\u0001 ;s1 2 ƒ1=2; 1⁄ Thus we have γ—f ‡ g– ' γ—f ‡ 0– ‡ γ—0 ‡ g– ' γf ‡ γg . If we deﬁne a change-of-basepoint transformation \fγ : ˇn—X; x1–!ˇn—X; x0– by \fγ—ƒf ⁄– … ƒγf ⁄ , then (1) shows that \fγ is a homomorphism, while (2) and (3) im- ply that \fγ is an isomorphism with inverse \fγ where γ is the inverse path of γ , 342 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory γ—s– … γ—1 − s– . Thus if X is path-connected, different choices of basepoint x0 yield isomorphic groups ˇn—X; x0– , which may then be written simply as ˇn—X– . Now let us restrict attention to loops γ at the basepoint x0 . Since \fγ\u0011 … \fγ\f\u0011 , the association ƒγ⁄ , \fγ deﬁnes a homomorphism from ˇ1—X; x0– to Aut—ˇn—X; x0–– , the group of automorphisms of ˇn—X; x0– . This is called the action of ˇ1 on ˇn , each element of ˇ1 acting as an automorphism ƒf ⁄ , ƒγf ⁄ of ˇn . When n … 1 this is the action of ˇ1 on itself by inner automorphisms. When n> 1 , the action makes the abelian group ˇn—X; x0– into a module over the group ring Zƒˇ1—X; x0–⁄ . Elements of Zƒˇ1⁄ are ﬁnite sums P i niγi with ni 2 Z and γi 2 ˇ1 , multiplication being deﬁned by distributivity and the multiplication in ˇ1 . The module structure on ˇn is given by (P i niγi\u0001 \u000b … P i ni—γi\u000b– for \u000b 2 ˇn . For brevity one sometimes says ˇn is a ˇ1 module rather than a Zƒˇ1⁄ module. In the literature, a space with trivial ˇ1 action on ˇn is called ‘ n simple,’ and ‘simple’ means ‘ n simple for all n .’ It would be nice to have more descriptive terms for these properties. In this book we will call a space abelian if it has trivial action of ˇ1 on all homotopy groups ˇn , since when n … 1 this is the condition that ˇ1 be abelian. This terminology is consistent with a long-established usage of the term ‘nilpotent’ to refer to spaces with nilpotent ˇ1 and nilpotent action of ˇ1 on all higher homotopy groups; see [Hilton, Mislin, & Roitberg 1975]. We next observe that ˇn is a functor. Namely, a map ' : —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– in- duces '\u0003 : ˇn—X; x0–!ˇn—Y ; y0– deﬁned by '\u0003—ƒf ⁄– … ƒ'f ⁄ . It is immediate from the deﬁnitions that '\u0003 is well-deﬁned and a homomorphism for n \u0015 1 . The func- tor properties —' –\u0003 … '\u0003 \u0003 and 11\u0003 … 11 are also evident, as is the fact that if 't : —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– is a homotopy then '0\u0003 … '1\u0003 . In particular, a homotopy equivalence —X; x0– ' —Y ; y0– in the basepointed sense induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups ˇn . This is true even if basepoints are not required to be stationary during homotopies. We showed this for ˇ1 in Proposi- tion 1.18, and the generalization to higher n ’s is an exercise at the end of this section. Homotopy groups behave very nicely with respect to covering spaces: Proposition 4.1. A covering space projection p : — eX; ex0–!—X; x0– induces isomor- phisms p\u0003 : ˇn— eX; ex0–!ˇn—X; x0– for all n \u0015 2 . Proof: For surjectivity of p\u0003 we apply the lifting criterion in Proposition 1.33, which implies that every map —S n;s0–!—X; x0– lifts to — eX; ex0– provided that n \u0015 2 so that S n is simply-connected. Injectivity of p\u0003 is immediate from the covering homotopy property, just as in Proposition 1.31 which treated the case n … 1. tu In particular, ˇn—X; x0– … 0 for n \u0015 2 whenever X has a contractible universal cover. This applies for example to S 1 , so we obtain the ﬁrst row of the table of homo- topy groups of spheres shown earlier. More generally, the n dimensional torus T n , Homotopy Groups Section 4.1 343 the product of n circles, has universal cover R n ,so ˇi—T n– … 0 for i> 1 . This is in marked contrast to the homology groups Hi—T n– which are nonzero for all i \u0014 n . Spaces with ˇn … 0 for all n \u0015 2 are sometimes called aspherical. The behavior of homotopy groups with respect to products is very simple: Proposition 4.2. For a product Q \u000b X\u000b of an arbitrary collection of path-connected spaces X\u000b there are isomorphisms ˇn(Q \u000b X\u000b\u0001 ˇ Q \u000b ˇn—X\u000b– for all n . Proof: A map f : Y! Q \u000b X\u000b is the same thing as a collection of maps f\u000b : Y!X\u000b . Taking Y to be S n and S n \u0002 I gives the result. tu Very useful generalizations of the homotopy groups ˇn—X; x0– are the relative homotopy groups ˇn—X;A;x0– for a pair —X; A– with a basepoint x0 2 A . To deﬁne these, regard In−1 as the face of In with the last coordinate sn … 0 and let Jn−1 be the closure of @In − In−1 , the union of the remaining faces of In . Then ˇn—X;A;x0– for n \u0015 1 is deﬁned to be the set of homotopy classes of maps —In;@In;Jn−1–!—X;A;x0– , with homotopies through maps of the same form. There does not seem to be a com- pletely satisfactory way of deﬁning ˇ0—X;A;x0– , so we shall leave this undeﬁned (but see the exercises for one possible deﬁnition). Note that ˇn—X; x0;x0– … ˇn—X; x0– ,so absolute homotopy groups are a special case of relative homotopy groups. A sum operation is deﬁned in ˇn—X;A;x0– by the same formulas as for ˇn—X; x0– , except that the coordinate sn now plays a special role and is no longer available for the sum operation. Thus ˇn—X;A;x0– is a group for n \u0015 2 , and this group is abelian for n \u0015 3 . For n … 1 we have I1 … ƒ0; 1⁄ , I0 …f0g , and J0 …f1g ,so ˇ1—X;A;x0– is the set of homotopy classes of paths in X from a varying point in A to the ﬁxed basepoint x0 2 A . In general this is not a group in any natural way. Just as elements of ˇn—X; x0– can be regarded as homotopy classes of maps —S n;s0–!—X; x0– , there is an alternative deﬁnition of ˇn—X;A;x0– as the set of ho- motopy classes of maps —Dn;S n−1;s0–!—X;A;x0– , since collapsing Jn−1 to a point converts —In;@In;Jn−1– into —Dn;S n−1;s0– . From this viewpoint, addition is done via the map c : Dn!Dn _ Dn collapsing Dn−1 ˆ Dn to a point. A useful and conceptually enlightening reformulation of what it means for an element of ˇn—X;A;x0– to be trivial is given by the following compression criterion: A map f : —Dn;S n−1;s0–!—X;A;x0– represents zero in ˇn—X;A;x0– iff it is ho- motopic rel S n−1 to a map with image contained in A . For if we have such a homotopy to a map g , then ƒf ⁄ … ƒg⁄ in ˇn—X;A;x0– , and ƒg⁄ … 0 via the homotopy obtained by composing g with a deformation retraction of Dn onto s0 . Conversely, if ƒf ⁄ … 0 via a homotopy F : Dn \u0002 I!X , then by restricting F to a family of n disks in Dn \u0002 I starting with Dn \u0002f0g and ending with the disk Dn \u0002f1g[ S n−1 \u0002 I , all the disks in the family having the same boundary, then we get a homotopy from f to a map into A , stationary on S n−1 . 344 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory A map ' : —X;A;x0–!—Y ;B;y0– induces maps '\u0003 : ˇn—X;A;x0–!ˇn—Y ;B;y0– which are homomorphisms for n \u0015 2 and have properties analogous to those in the absolute case: —' –\u0003 … '\u0003 \u0003 , 11\u0003 … 11 , and '\u0003 … \u0003 if ' ' through maps —X;A;x0–!—Y ;B;y0– . Probably the most useful feature of the relative groups ˇn—X;A;x0– is that they ﬁt into a long exact sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! ˇn—A; x0– i\u0003-----! ˇn—X; x0– j\u0003-----! ˇn—X;A;x0– @-----! ˇn−1—A; x0– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! ˇ0—X; x0– Here i and j are the inclusions —A; x0– > —X; x0– and —X; x0;x0– > —X;A;x0– . The map @ comes from restricting maps —In;@In;Jn−1–!—X;A;x0– to In−1 , or by restrict- ing maps —Dn;S n−1;s0–!—X;A;x0– to S n−1 . The map @ , called the boundary map, is a homomorphism when n> 1. Theorem 4.3. This sequence is exact. Near the end of the sequence, where group structures are not deﬁned, exactness still makes sense: The image of one map is the kernel of the next, those elements mapping to the homotopy class of the constant map. Proof: With only a little more effort we can derive the long exact sequence of a triple —X;A;B;x0– with x0 2 B ˆ A ˆ X : \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! ˇn—A; B; x0– i\u0003-----! ˇn—X;B;x0– j\u0003-----! ˇn—X;A;x0– @-----! ˇn−1—A; B; x0– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! ˇ1—X;A;x0– When B … x0 this reduces to the exact sequence for the pair —X;A;x0– , though the lat- ter sequence continues on two more steps to ˇ0—X; x0– . The veriﬁcation of exactness at these last two steps is left as a simple exercise. Exactness at ˇn—X;B;x0– : First note that the composition j\u0003i\u0003 is zero since every map —In;@In;Jn−1–!—A; B; x0– represents zero in ˇn—X;A;x0– by the compression criterion. To see that Ker j\u0003 ˆ Im i\u0003 , let f : —In;@In;Jn−1–!—X;B;x0– represent zero in ˇn—X;A;x0– . Then by the compression criterion again, f is homotopic rel @In to a map with image in A , hence the class ƒf ⁄ 2 ˇn—X;B;x0– is in the image of i\u0003 . Exactness at ˇn—X;A;x0– : The composition @j\u0003 is zero since the restriction of a map —In;@In;Jn−1–!—X;B;x0– to In−1 has image lying in B , and hence represents zero in ˇn−1—A; B; x0– . Conversely, suppose the restriction of f : —In;@In;Jn−1–!—X;A;x0– to In−1 represents zero in ˇn−1—A; B; x0– . Then f jj In−1 is homotopic to a map with im- age in B via a homotopy F : In−1 \u0002 I!A rel @In−1 . We can tack F onto f to get a new map —In;@In;Jn−1–!—X;B;x0– which, as a map —In;@In;Jn−1–!—X;A;x0– , is homotopic to f by the homotopy that tacks on increasingly longer initial segments of F .So ƒf ⁄ 2 Im j\u0003 . f F x 0 x 0 x 0 0x x 0 A B Homotopy Groups Section 4.1 345 Exactness at ˇn—A; B; x0– : The composition i\u0003@ is zero since the restriction of a map f : —In‡1;@In‡1;Jn–!—X;A;x0– to In is homotopic rel @In to a constant map via f itself. The converse is easy if B is a point, since a nullhomotopy ft : —In;@In–!—X; x0– of f0 : —In;@In–!—A; x0– gives a map F : —In‡1;@In‡1;Jn–!—X;A;x0– with @—ƒF ⁄– … ƒf0⁄ . Thus the proof is ﬁnished in this case. For a general B , let F be a nullhomo- topy of f : —In;@In;Jn−1–!—A; B; x0– through maps —In;@In;Jn−1–!—X;B;x0– , and let g be the restriction of F to In−1 \u0002 I , as in the ﬁrst of the two pictures below. Reparametrizing the n th and —n ‡ 1– st coor- dinates as shown in the second picture, we see that f with g tacked on is in the image of @ . But as we noted in the preceding paragraph, tacking g onto f gives the same element of ˇn—A; B; x0– . tu f g g f x 0 x 0 x 0 x 0 x 0 Example 4.4. Let CX be the cone on a path-connected space X , the quotient space of X \u0002 I obtained by collapsing X \u0002f0g to a point. We can view X as the subspace X \u0002f1gˆ CX . Since CX is contractible, the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair —CX; X– gives isomorphisms ˇn—CX; X; x0– ˇ ˇn−1—X; x0– for all n \u0015 1. Taking n … 2 , we can thus realize any group G , abelian or not, as a relative ˇ2 by choosing X to have ˇ1—X– ˇ G . The long exact sequence of homotopy groups is clearly natural: A map of base- pointed triples —X;A;B;x0–!—Y ;C;D;y0– induces a map between the associated long exact sequences, with commuting squares. There are change-of-basepoint isomorphisms \fγ for relative homotopy groups analogous to those in the absolute case. One starts with a path γ in A ˆ X from x0 to x1 , and this induces \fγ : ˇn—X;A;x1–!ˇn—X;A;x0– by setting \fγ—ƒf ⁄– … ƒγf ⁄ where γf is deﬁned as in the picture, by placing A°° f a copy of f in a smaller cube with its face In−1 centered in the corresponding face of the larger cube. This construction satisﬁes the same basic properties as in the absolute case, with very similar proofs that we leave to the exercises. Separate proofs must be given in the two cases since the deﬁnition of γf in the relative case does not specialize to the deﬁnition of γf in the absolute case. The isomorphisms \fγ show that ˇn—X;A;x0– is independent of x0 when A is path-connected. In this case ˇn—X;A;x0– is often written simply as ˇn—X; A– . Restricting to loops at the basepoint, the association γ , \fγ deﬁnes an action of ˇ1—A; x0– on ˇn—X;A;x0– analogous to the action of ˇ1—X; x0– on ˇn—X; x0– in the absolute case. In fact, it is clear from the deﬁnitions that ˇ1—A; x0– acts on the whole long exact sequence of homotopy groups for —X;A;x0– , the action commuting with the various maps in the sequence. 346 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory A space X with basepoint x0 is said to be n connected if ˇi—X; x0– … 0 for i \u0014 n . Thus 0 connected means path-connected and 1 connected means simply- connected. Since n connected implies 0 connected, the choice of the basepoint x0 is not signiﬁcant. The condition of being n connected can be expressed without mention of a basepoint since it is an easy exercise to check that the following three conditions are equivalent. (1) Every map S i!X is homotopic to a constant map. (2) Every map S i!X extends to a map Di‡1!X . (3) ˇi—X; x0– … 0 for all x0 2 X . Thus X is n connected if any one of these three conditions holds for all i \u0014 n . Similarly, in the relative case it is not hard to see that the following four conditions are equivalent, for i> 0: (1) Every map —Di;@Di–!—X; A– is homotopic rel @Di to a map Di!A . (2) Every map —Di;@Di–!—X; A– is homotopic through such maps to a map Di!A . (3) Every map —Di;@Di–!—X; A– is homotopic through such maps to a constant map Di!A . (4) ˇi—X;A;x0– … 0 for all x0 2 A . When i … 0 we did not deﬁne the relative ˇ0 , and (1)–(3) are each equivalent to saying that each path-component of X contains points in A since D0 is a point and @D0 is empty. The pair —X; A– is called n connected if (1)–(4) hold for all i \u0014 n , i> 0 , and (1)–(3) hold for i … 0. Note that X is n connected iff —X; x0– is n connected for some x0 and hence for all x0 . Whitehead’s Theorem Since CW complexes are built using attaching maps whose domains are spheres, it is perhaps not too surprising that homotopy groups of CW complexes carry a lot of information. Whitehead’s theorem makes this explicit: Theorem 4.5. If a map f : X!Y between connected CW complexes induces isomor- phisms f\u0003 : ˇn—X–!ˇn—Y – for all n , then f is a homotopy equivalence. In case f is the inclusion of a subcomplex X > Y , the conclusion is stronger: X is a deformation retract of Y . The proof will follow rather easily from a more technical result that turns out to be very useful in quite a number of arguments. For convenient reference we call this the compression lemma. Lemma 4.6. Let —X; A– be a CW pair and let —Y ; B– be any pair with B ﬂ ; . For each n such that X − A has cells of dimension n , assume that ˇn—Y ;B;y0– … 0 for all y0 2 B . Then every map f : —X; A–!—Y ; B– is homotopic rel A to a map X!B . Homotopy Groups Section 4.1 347 When n … 0 the condition that ˇn—Y ;B;y0– … 0 for all y0 2 B is to be regarded as saying that —Y ; B– is 0 connected. Proof: Assume inductively that f has already been homotoped to take the skeleton Xk−1 to B .If Ø is the characteristic map of a cell ek of X − A , the composition f Ø : —Dk;@Dk–!—Y ; B– can be homotoped into B rel @Dk in view of the hypothesis that ˇk—Y ;B;y0– … 0if k> 0 , or that —Y ; B– is 0 connected if k … 0 . This homotopy of f Ø induces a homotopy of f on the quotient space Xk−1 [ ek of Xk−1 q Dk ,a homotopy rel Xk−1 . Doing this for all k cells of X − A simultaneously, and taking the constant homotopy on A , we obtain a homotopy of f jj Xk [ A to a map into B . By the homotopy extension property in Proposition 0.16, this homotopy extends to a homotopy deﬁned on all of X , and the induction step is completed. Finitely many applications of the induction step ﬁnish the proof if the cells of X − A are of bounded dimension. In the general case we perform the homotopy of the induction step during the t interval ƒ1 − 1=2 k; 1 − 1=2 k‡1⁄ . Any ﬁnite skeleton Xk is eventually stationary under these homotopies, hence we have a well-deﬁned homotopy ft , t 2 ƒ0; 1⁄ , with f1—X– ˆ B . tu Proof of Whitehead’s Theorem: In the special case that f is the inclusion of a sub- complex, consider the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair —Y ; X– . Since f induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups, the relative groups ˇn—Y ; X– are zero. Applying the lemma to the identity map —Y ; X–!—Y ; X– then yields a de- formation retraction of Y onto X . The general case can be proved using mapping cylinders. Recall that the mapping cylinder Mf of a map f : X!Y is the quotient space of the disjoint union of X \u0002 I and Y under the identiﬁcations —x; 1– ˘ f—x– . Thus Mf contains both X … X \u0002f0g and Y as subspaces, and Mf deformation retracts onto Y . The map f becomes the composition of the inclusion X>Mf with the retraction Mf !Y . Since this retraction is a homotopy equivalence, it sufﬁces to show that Mf deformation retracts onto X if f induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups, or equivalently, if the relative groups ˇn—Mf ;X– are all zero. If the map f happens to be cellular, taking the n skeleton of X to the n skeleton of Y for all n , then —Mf ;X– is a CW pair and so we are done by the ﬁrst paragraph of the proof. If f is not cellular, we can either appeal to Theorem 4.8 which says that f is homotopic to a cellular map, or we can use the following argument. First apply the preceding lemma to obtain a homotopy rel X of the inclusion —X [Y; X–>—Mf ;X– to a map into X . Since the pair —Mf ;X [ Y– obviously satisﬁes the homotopy extension property, this homotopy extends to a homotopy from the identity map of Mf to a map g : Mf !Mf taking X [ Y into X . Then apply the lemma again to the composition —X \u0002 I q Y; X \u0002 @I q Y– -! —Mf ;X [ Y– g -----! —Mf ;X– to ﬁnish the construction of a deformation retraction of Mf onto X . tu 348 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Whitehead’s theorem does not say that two CW complexes X and Y with iso- morphic homotopy groups are homotopy equivalent, since there is a big difference between saying that X and Y have isomorphic homotopy groups and saying that there is a map X!Y inducing isomorphisms on homotopy groups. For example, consider X … RP2 and Y … S 2 \u0002 RP1 . These both have fundamental group Z2 , and Proposition 4.1 implies that their higher homotopy groups are isomorphic since their universal covers S 2 and S 2 \u0002 S 1 are homotopy equivalent, S 1 being contractible. But RP2 and S 2 \u0002 RP1 are not homotopy equivalent since their homology groups are vastly different, S 2 \u0002 RP1 having nonvanishing homology in inﬁnitely many dimen- sions since it retracts onto RP1 . Another pair of CW complexes that are not homotopy equivalent but have isomorphic homotopy groups is S 2 and S 3 \u0002 CP1 , as we shall see in Example 4.51. One very special case when the homotopy type of a CW complex is determined by its homotopy groups is when all the homotopy groups are trivial, for then the inclusion map of a 0 cell into the complex induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups, so the complex deformation retracts to the 0 cell. Somewhat similar in spirit to the compression lemma is the following rather basic extension lemma: Lemma 4.7. Given a CW pair —X; A– and a map f : A!Y with Y path-connected, then f can be extended to a map X!Y if ˇn−1—Y – … 0 for all n such that X − A has cells of dimension n . Proof: Assume inductively that f has been extended over the —n − 1– skeleton. Then an extension over an n cell exists iff the composition of the cell’s attaching map S n−1!Xn−1 with f : Xn−1!Y is nullhomotopic. tu Cellular Approximation When we showed that ˇ1—S k– … 0 for k> 1 in Proposition 1.14, we ﬁrst showed that every loop in S k can be deformed to miss at least one point if k> 1 , then we used the fact that the complement of a point in S k is contractible to ﬁnish the proof. The same strategy could be used to show that ˇn—S k– … 0 for n<k if we could do the ﬁrst step of deforming a map S n!S k to be nonsurjective. One might at ﬁrst think this step was unnecessary, that no continuous map S n!S k could be surjective when n<k , but it is not hard to use space-ﬁlling curves from point-set topology to produce such maps. Some work must then be done to construct homotopies eliminating this rather strange behavior. For maps between CW complexes it turns out to be sufﬁcient for this and many other purposes in homotopy theory to require just that cells map to cells of the same or lower dimension. Such a map f : X!Y , satisfying f—Xn– ˆ Y n for all n , is called Homotopy Groups Section 4.1 349 a cellular map. It is a fundamental fact that arbitrary maps can always be deformed to be cellular. This is the cellular approximation theorem: Theorem 4.8. Every map f : X!Y of CW complexes is homotopic to a cellular map. If f is already cellular on a subcomplex A ˆ X , the homotopy may be taken to be stationary on A . Corollary 4.9. ˇn—S k– … 0 for n<k . Proof:If S n and S k are given their usual CW structures, with the 0 cells as basepoints, then every basepoint-preserving map S n!S k can be homotoped, ﬁxing the basepoint, to be cellular, and hence constant if n<k . tu Linear maps cannot increase dimension, so one might to try to show that arbi- trary maps can be homotoped to maps with some sort of linearity properties. One of the oldest results of this sort is the simplicial approximation theorem in x2.C. Cellular approximation can be regarded as an analog for CW complexes of simplicial approximation for simplicial complexes since simplicial maps are cellular. However, simplicial maps are much more rigid than cellular maps, which perhaps explains why subdivision of the domain is required for simplicial approximation but not for cellular approximation. The core of the proof of cellular approximation will be a weak form of simplicial approximation that can be proved by a rather elementary direct argument. Proof of 4.8: Suppose inductively that f : X!Y is already cellular on the skeleton Xn−1 , and let en be an n cell of X . The closure of en in X is compact, being the image of a characteristic map for en ,so f takes the closure of en to a compact set in Y . Since a compact set in a CW complex can meet only ﬁnitely many cells by Proposition A.1 in the Appendix, it follows that f—en– meets only ﬁnitely many cells of Y . Let ek ˆ Y be a cell of highest dimension meeting f—en– . We may assume k>n , otherwise f is already cellular on en . We will show below that it is possible to deform f jj Xn−1 [ en , staying ﬁxed on Xn−1 , so that f—en– misses some point p 2 ek . Then we can deform f jj Xn−1 [ en rel Xn−1 so that f—en– misses the whole cell ek by composing with a deformation retraction of Y k −fpg onto Y k − ek . By ﬁnitely many iterations of this process we eventually make f—en– miss all cells of dimension greater than n . Doing this for all n cells, staying ﬁxed on n cells in A where f is already cellular, we obtain a homotopy of f jj Xn rel Xn−1 [ A n to a cellular map. The induction step is then completed by appealing to the homotopy extension property in Proposition 0.16 to extend this homotopy, together with the constant homotopy on A , to a homotopy deﬁned on all of X . Letting n go to 1 , the resulting possibly inﬁnite string of homotopies can be realized as a single homotopy by performing the n th homotopy during the t interval ƒ1 − 1=2 n; 1 − 1=2n‡1⁄ . This makes sense since each point of X lies in some Xn , which is eventually stationary in the inﬁnite chain of homotopies. 350 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory To ﬁll in the missing step in this argument we will use the following technical statement: Lemma 4.10. Let f : In!Z be a map, where Z is obtained from a subspace W by attaching a cell ek . Then f is homotopic rel f −1—W – to a map f1 for which there is a simplex Ñk ˆ ek with f −1 1 —Ñ k– a union (possibly empty) of ﬁnitely many convex polyhedra, on each of which f1 is the restriction of a linear surjection R n!R k . Here a convex polyhedron in In ˆ R n is any subspace that can be obtained as the intersection of a ﬁnite number of half-spaces deﬁned by linear inequalities of the form Pi aixi \u0014 b . Before proving the lemma, let us see how it ﬁnishes the proof of the cellular approximation theorem. Composing the given map f : Xn−1 [ en!Y k with a char- acteristic map In!X for en , we obtain a map f as in the lemma, with Z … Y k and W … Y k − ek . The homotopy given by the lemma is ﬁxed on @In , hence induces a homotopy ft of f jj Xn−1 [ en ﬁxed on Xn−1 .If k>n , there are no surjective linear maps Rn!R k ,so f −1 1 —Ñ k– must be empty, and we can choose p to be any point of Ñk . tu Proof of 4.10: Identifying ek with R k , let B1;B2 ˆ ek be the closed balls of radius 1 and 2 centered at the origin. Since f −1—B2– is closed and therefore compact in In ,it follows that f is uniformly continuous on f −1—B2– . Thus there exists \"> 0 such that jx − yj <\" implies jf—x– − f—y–j < 1=2 for all x; y 2 f −1—B2– . Subdivide the interval I so that the induced subdivision of In into cubes has each cube lying in a ball of diameter less than \" . Let K1 be the union of all the closed cubes meeting f −1—B1– , and let K2 be the union of all the closed cubes meeting K1 . Then we have inclusions f −1—B1– ˆ K1 ˆ K2 ˆ f −1—B2– , the last one because points of f—K2– have distance less than 1=2 from f—K1– and points of f—K1– have distance less than 1=2 from B1 . K K 1 K1f 2 B B 1 2 f 1_ ( ) () K2f () B1 f 1_ ( )B2 We can view K2 as a CW complex whose i cells are i dimensional open cubes, the interiors of the i dimensional faces of the k dimensional cubes of K2 for i \u0014 k . The barycentric subdivision of this cubical cell structure is a simplicial complex structure on K2 whose vertices are the center points of the cells. One can build this simplicial structure inductively over skeleta of the cubical cell structure, the induction step being Homotopy Groups Section 4.1 351 to cone off the simplicial structure on the boundary of each cubical cell to the center point of the cell. Let g : K2!ek … R k be the map that equals f on all vertices of simplices of the subdivision and is linear on each simplex. Deﬁne a homotopy ft : K2!ek by the formula —1 − t'–f ‡ —t'–g where ' : K2!ƒ0; 1⁄ is a map with '—@K2– … 0 and '—K1– … 1 . Thus f0 … f and f1 jj K1 … g jj K1 . Since ft is the constant homotopy on @K2 , we may extend ft to be the constant homotopy of f on the rest of In . We claim that there is a neighborhood N of 0 in B1 such that f −1 1 —N– ˆ K1 . This is equivalent to saying that f1 sends the complement of K1 to the complement of N . Points in the complement of K2 are no problem since f1 … f on such points and f sends the complement of K2 to the complement of B1 . For points of K2 − K1 consider a simplex ˙ of the subdivision of K2 . This is mapped by f into a ball B˙ of radius 1=2. Since B˙ is convex, g also maps ˙ into B˙ , and therefore so does f1 . If ˙ is not contained in K1 , then B˙ meets the exterior of B1 and hence is disjoint from a neighborhood of 0 in B1 . Since there are only ﬁnitely many ˙ ’s, there is a neighborhood N of0in B1 disjoint from f1—˙ – for all ˙ not contained in K1 . For this N we have f −1 1 —N– ˆ K1 . For a simplex Ñk ˆ N , the preimage f −1 1 —Ñ k– ˆ K1 is the union of its intersections with simplices ˙ of K1 , and each such intersection is a convex polyhedron since it is the intersection of ˙ with the convex polyhedron L −1 ˙ —Ñ k– where L˙ : R n!R k is the linear map restricting to g on ˙ . (Recall that f1 … g on K1 .) To ﬁnish the proof it therefore sufﬁces to choose Ñk to be disjoint from the images of all the nonsurjective L˙ ’s, which is certainly possible since these images consist of ﬁnitely many hyperplanes of dimension less than k . tu Example 4.11: Cellular Approximation for Pairs. Every map f : —X; A–!—Y ; B– of CW pairs can be deformed through maps —X; A–!—Y ; B– to a cellular map. This follows from the theorem by ﬁrst deforming the restriction f : A!B to be cellular, then extending this to a homotopy of f on all of X , then deforming the resulting map to be cellular staying ﬁxed on A . As a further reﬁnement, the homotopy of f can be taken to be stationary on any subcomplex of X where f is already cellular. An easy consequence of this is: Corollary 4.12. A CW pair —X; A– is n connected if all the cells in X − A have dimension greater than n . In particular the pair —X; Xn– is n connected, hence the inclusion Xn > X induces isomorphisms on ˇi for i<n and a surjection on ˇn . Proof: Applying cellular approximation to maps —Di;@Di–!—X; A– with i \u0014 n gives the ﬁrst statement. The last statement comes from the long exact sequence of the pair —X; Xn– . tu 352 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory CW Approximation A map f : X!Y is called a weak homotopy equivalence if it induces isomor- phisms ˇn—X; x0–!ˇn( Y; f—x0–\u0001 for all n \u0015 0 and all choices of basepoint x0 . Whitehead’s theorem can be restated as saying that a weak homotopy equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence. It follows easily that this holds also for spaces homotopy equivalent to CW complexes. In general, however, weak homotopy equivalence is strictly weaker than homotopy equivalence. For example, there exist noncontractible spaces whose homotopy groups are all trivial, such as the ‘quasi-circle’ according to an exercise at the end of this section, and for such spaces a map to a point is a weak homotopy equivalence that is not a homotopy equivalence. One of the more important results in this subsection is that for every space X there is a CW complex Z and a weak homotopy equivalence f : Z!X . Such a map f : Z!X is called a CW approximation to X . A weak homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms on all homology and cohomology groups, as we will show, so CW ap- proximations allow many general statements in algebraic topology to be reduced to the case of CW complexes, where one can often make cell-by-cell arguments. The technique for constructing CW approximations can be used to do other things as well. For a start, one could try for a relative version in which X is assumed to contain a subspace A which is already a CW complex and Z is constructed to contain A as a subcomplex, with f : Z!X restricting to the identity map on A . Next, if —X; A– is n connected, one could try to make —Z; A– n connected in the strong geometric sense that all cells of Z − A have dimension greater than n . In fact, it turns out to be possible to do a construction satisfying the latter condition even if —X; A– is not n connected, but in this case ˇi—Z– for i<n will be isomorphic to ˇi—A– rather than to ˇi—X– . Here is a deﬁnition that is sufﬁciently general to cover all these situations. Given a pair —X; A– where the subspace A ˆ X is a nonempty CW complex, an n connected CW model for —X; A– is an n connected CW pair —Z; A– and a map f : Z!X with f jj A the identity, such that f\u0003 : ˇi—Z–!ˇi—X– is an isomorphism for i>n and an injection for i … n , for all choices of basepoint. Since —Z; A– is n connected, the map ˇi—A–!ˇi—Z– is an isomorphism for i<n and a surjection for i … n . In the critical dimension n , the maps A > Z f -----! X induce a composition ˇn—A–!ˇn—Z–!ˇn—X– factoring the map ˇn—A–!ˇn—X– as a surjection followed by an injection, just as any homomorphism ' : G!H can be factored (uniquely) as a surjection ' : G! Im ' followed by an injection Im ' > H . One can think of Z as a sort of homotopy- theoretic hybrid of A and X .As n increases, the hybrid looks more and more like A , and less and less like X . This deﬁnition specializes to the earlier notion of a CW approximation by taking n … 0 and letting A consist of one point in each path-component of X . This forces f\u0003 : ˇ0—Z–!ˇ0—X– to be surjective as well as injective. Homotopy Groups Section 4.1 353 Proposition 4.13. For every pair —X; A– with A a nonempty CW complex there exist n connected CW models f : —Z; A–!—X; A– for all n \u0015 0 , and these models can be chosen to have the additional property that Z is obtained from A by attaching cells of dimension greater than n . Note that the condition that Z − A consists of cells of dimension greater than n automatically implies that —Z; A– is n connected, by cellular approximation. Proof: We will construct Z as a union of subcomplexes A … Zn ˆ Zn‡1 ˆ \u0001\u0001\u0001 with Zk obtained from Zk−1 by attaching k cells. Suppose inductively that we have already constructed Zk and a map f : Zk!X restricting to the identity on A and such that the induced map on ˇi is an injection for n \u0014 i<k and a surjection for n<i \u0014 k , with respect to a choice of basepoint 0 cell xγ in each component Aγ of A . The induction begins with k … n and Zn … A , when these conditions are vacuous. For the induction step, choose cellular maps '\u000b : S k!Zk representing generators for the kernel of f\u0003 : ˇk—Zk;xγ–!ˇk—X; xγ– , for all γ . Attach cells ek‡1 \u000b to Zk via these maps '\u000b , and call the resulting complex Yk‡1 . Since the compositions f'\u000b are nullhomotopic, we can extend f over Yk‡1 . The map f\u0003 : ˇk—Yk‡1;xγ–!ˇk—X; xγ– is then injective since each element of the kernel is represented by a cellular map, with image in Zk , and such maps are nullhomotopic in Yk‡1 by construction. The extended f still induces a surjection on ˇk since the composition ˇk—Zk–!ˇk—Yk‡1–!ˇk—X– is surjective. The homotopy groups ˇi for i<k are not affected by attaching the cells ek‡1 \u000b . When k … 0 the construction needs to be done differently since ˇ0 has no group structure. Instead, we form Y1 by attaching 1 cells joining all basepoint 0 cells xγ lying in the same path-component of X . Next, choose maps \f : S k‡1!X generating ˇk‡1—X; xγ– for all γ . Let Zk‡1 be the wedge sum of Yk‡1 with spheres S k‡1 \f at the appropriate basepoints xγ , and ex- tend f over Zk‡1 by letting it equal \f on S k‡1 \f . This guarantees that the induced map f\u0003 : ˇk‡1—Zk‡1;xγ–!ˇk‡1—X; xγ– is surjective. The inclusion Yk‡1 > Zk‡1 induces an isomorphism on ˇi for i \u0014 k , surjectivity coming from cellular approximation and injectivity from a retraction of Zk‡1 onto Yk‡1 . This ﬁnishes the induction step. Since the maps f\u0003 : ˇi—Z; xγ–!ˇi—X; xγ– depend only on the —i ‡ 1– skeleton of Z , they are isomorphisms for all i>n and injective for i … n . This holds in fact for all basepoints in Z , not just the xγ ’s, since every point in Z is joined by a path to some xγ . tu Example 4.14. When X is path-connected and A is a point, the construction of a 0 connected CW model for —X; A– gives a CW approximation to X with a single 0 cell and all higher cells attached by basepoint-preserving maps. In particular, any con- nected CW complex is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex with these properties. Example 4.15. One can also apply the proposition to obtain a CW approximation to an arbitrary pair —X; X0– . First construct a CW approximation f0 : Z0!X0 , then form 354 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory a0 connected CW model —Z; Z0–!—M; Z0– where M is the mapping cylinder of the composition of f0 with the inclusion X0 > X . Composing the map Z!M with the retraction of M onto X , we obtain an extension of f0 to a CW approximation f : Z!X . It follows from the ﬁve-lemma that the map —Z; Z0–!—X; X0– induces isomorphisms on relative as well as absolute homotopy groups. Here is a rather different application of the preceding proposition, giving a more geometric interpretation to n connectedness: Corollary 4.16. If —X; A– is an n connected CW pair, then there exists a CW pair —Z; A– ' —X; A– rel A such that all cells of Z − A have dimension greater than n . Proof:An n connected CW approximation f : —Z; A–!—X; A– given by the preceding proposition will do the trick. First we check that f induces isomorphisms ˇi—Z– ˇ ˇi—X– for all i . This is true for i>n by deﬁnition, and for i<n it holds since both inclusions A>Z and A>X induce isomorphisms on these lower homotopy groups. For i … n , f induces an injection on ˇn by deﬁnition, and since the inclusion A > X induces a surjection on ˇn , so does f via the composition ˇn—A–!ˇn—Z–!ˇn—X– . Since f induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups, it is a homotopy equiv- alence. To see that it is a homotopy equivalence rel A , form a quotient space W of the mapping cylinder Mf by collapsing each segment fag\u0002 I to a point, for a 2 A . Assuming f has been made cellular, W is a CW complex containing X and Z as sub- complexes, and W deformation retracts to X just as Mf does. Also, ˇi—W ; Z– … 0 for all i since f induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups, so W deformation retracts onto Z . These two deformation retractions of W onto X and Z are stationary on A , hence give a homotopy equivalence X ' Z rel A . tu Example 4.17: Postnikov Towers. For a CW complex X , which we may as well take to be connected, let us construct a sequence of spaces Xn such that ˇi—Xn– ˇ ˇi—X– for i \u0014 n and ˇi—Xn– … 0 for i>n . Choose cellular maps '\u000b : S n‡1!X generating ˇn‡1 and use these to attach cells en‡2 \u000b to X , forming a CW complex Y . By cellular approximation the inclusion X > Y induces isomorphisms on ˇi for i \u0014 n , and ˇn‡1—Y – … 0 since any element of ˇn‡1—Y – is represented by a map to X by cellular approximation, and such maps are nullhomotopic in Y by construction. Now the process can be be repeated with Y in place of X and n replaced by n ‡ 1 to make a space with ˇn‡2 zero as well as ˇn‡1 , by attaching —n ‡ 3– cells. After inﬁnitely many iterations we have enlarged X to a CW complex Xn such that the inclusion X > Xn induces an isomorphism on ˇi for i \u0014 n and ˇi—Xn– … 0 for i>n . This construction is in fact a special case of the construction of CW models, with —Xn;X– an —n ‡ 1– connected CW model for —CX; X– with CX the cone on X . The inclusion X > Xn extends to a map Xn‡1!Xn since Xn‡1 is obtained from X by attaching cells of dimension n ‡ 3 and greater, and ˇi—Xn– … 0 for i>n so we Homotopy Groups Section 4.1 355 can apply Lemma 4.7, the extension lemma. Thus we have a commu- tative diagram as at the right. This is a called a Postnikov tower for X . One can regard the spaces Xn as truncations of X which provide suc-¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! XX1 X2 X3... cessively better approximations to X as n increases. Postnikov towers turn out to be quite powerful tools for proving general theorems, and we will study them further in x4.3. After this example one may wonder whether n connected CW models —Zn;A– for an arbitrary pair —X; A– always ﬁt into a tower. The following proposition will allow us to construct such towers, among other things. Proposition 4.18. Suppose we are given : (i) an n connected CW model f : —Z; A–!—X; A– , (ii) an n0 connected CW model f 0 : —Z 0;A 0–!—X0;A 0– , (iii) a map g : —X; A–!—X0;A 0– . Then if n \u0015 n0 , there is a map h : Z!Z 0 such that h jj A … g and gf ' f 0h rel A ,so¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! Z ZX X 00 0 f h g f the diagram above is commutative up to homotopy rel A . Furthermore, such a map h is unique up to homotopy rel A . Proof: By Corollary 4.16 we may assume all cells of Z − A have dimension greater than n . Let W be the quotient space of the mapping cylinder of f 0 obtained by collapsing each line segment fa0g\u0002 I to a point, for a 0 2 A0 . We can think of W as a relative mapping cylinder, and like the ordinary mapping cylinder, W contains copies of Z 0 and X0 , the latter as a deformation retract. The assumption that —Z 0;A 0– is an n0 connected CW model for —X0;A 0– implies that the relative groups ˇi—W ; Z 0– are zero for i>n0 . Via the inclusion X0 > W we can view gf as a map Z!W . As a map of pairs —Z; A–!—W ; Z 0– , gf is homotopic rel A to a map h with image in Z 0 , by the com- pression lemma and the hypothesis n \u0015 n0 . This proves the ﬁrst assertion. For the second, suppose h0 and h1 are two maps Z!Z 0 whose compositions with f 0 are homotopic to gf rel A . Thus if we regard h0 and h1 as maps to W , they are homo- topic rel A . Such a homotopy gives a map —Z \u0002 I; Z \u0002 @I [ A\u0002 I–!—W ; Z 0– , and by the compression lemma again this map can be deformed rel Z \u0002 @I [ A\u0002 I to a map with image in Z 0 , which gives the desired homotopy h0 ' h1 rel A . tu Corollary 4.19. An n connected CW model for —X; A– is unique up to homotopy equivalence rel A . In particular, CW approximations to spaces are unique up to ho- motopy equivalence. Proof: Given two n connected CW models —Z; A– and —Z 0;A– for —X; A– , we apply the proposition twice with g the identity map to obtain maps h : Z!Z 0 and h 0 : Z 0!Z . The uniqueness statement gives homotopies hh0 ' 11 and h0h ' 11 rel A . tu 356 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Taking n … n 0 in the proposition, we obtain also a functoriality property for n connected CW models. For example, a map X!X0 induces a map of CW approxi- mations Z!Z 0 , which is unique up to homotopy. The proposition allows us to relate n connected CW models —Zn;A– for —X; A– for varying n , by means of maps Zn!Zn−1 that form a tower as shown in the diagram, with commutative triangles on the left and homotopy-commutative triangles on¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! AZ X0 Z 1 Z 2... the right. We can make the triangles on the right strictly com- mutative by replacing the maps Zn!X by the compositions through Z0 . Example 4.20: Whitehead Towers . If we take X to be an arbitrary CW complex with the subspace A a point, then the resulting tower of n connected CW models amounts to a sequence of maps \u0001\u0001\u0001 !Z2!Z1!Z0!X with Zn n connected and the map Zn!X inducing an isomorphism on all homotopy groups ˇi with i>n . The space Z0 is path-connected and homotopy equivalent to the component of X containing A , so one may as well assume Z0 equals this component. The next space Z1 is simply-connected, and the map Z1!X has the homotopy properties of the universal cover of the component Z0 of X . For larger values of n one can by analogy view the map Zn!X as an ‘ n connected cover’ of X . For n> 1 these do not seem to arise so frequently in nature as in the case n … 1 . A rare exception is the Hopf map S 3!S 2 deﬁned in Example 4.45, which is a 2 connected cover. Now let us show that CW approximations behave well with respect to homology and cohomology: Proposition 4.21. A weak homotopy equivalence f : X!Y induces isomorphisms f\u0003 : Hn—X; G–!Hn—Y ; G– and f \u0003 : Hn—Y ; G–!Hn—X; G– for all n and all coefﬁcient groups G . Proof: Replacing Y by the mapping cylinder Mf and looking at the long exact se- quences of homotopy, homology, and cohomology groups for —Mf ;X– , we see that it sufﬁces to show: If —Z; X– is an n connected pair of path-connected spaces, then Hi—Z; X; G– … 0 and Hi—Z; X; G– … 0 for all i \u0014 n and all G . Let \u000b … P j nj˙j be a relative cycle representing an element of Hk—Z; X; G– , for sin- gular k simplices ˙j : Ñ k!Z . Build a ﬁnite Ñ complex K from a disjoint union of k simplices, one for each ˙j , by identifying all —k − 1– dimensional faces of these k simplices for which the corresponding restrictions of the ˙j ’s are equal. Thus the ˙j ’s induce a map ˙ : K!Z . Since \u000b is a relative cycle, @\u000b is a chain in X . Let Homotopy Groups Section 4.1 357 L ˆ K be the subcomplex consisting of —k − 1– simplices corresponding to the sin- gular —k − 1– simplices in @\u000b ,so ˙ —L– ˆ X . The chain \u000b is the image under the chain map ˙] of a chain e\u000b in K , with @ e\u000b a chain in L . In relative homology we then have ˙\u0003ƒ e\u000b⁄ … ƒ\u000b⁄ . If we assume ˇi—Z; X– … 0 for i \u0014 k , then ˙ : —K; L–!—Z; X– is homotopic rel L to a map with image in X , by the compression lemma. Hence ˙\u0003ƒ e\u000b⁄ is in the image of the map Hk—X; X; G–!Hk—Z; X; G– , and since Hk—X; X; G– … 0we conclude that ƒ\u000b⁄ … ˙\u0003ƒ e\u000b⁄ … 0 . This proves the result for homology, and the result for cohomology then follows by the universal coefﬁcient theorem. tu CW approximations can be used to reduce many statements about general spaces to the special case of CW complexes. For example, the cup product version of the K¨unneth formula in Theorem 3.16, asserting that H\u0003—X \u0002 Y ; R– ˇ H\u0003—X; R– ⊗ H\u0003—Y ; R– under certain conditions, can now be extended to non-CW spaces since if X and Y are CW approximations to spaces Z and W , respectively, then X \u0002 Y is a CW approx- imation to Z \u0002 W . Here we are giving X \u0002 Y the CW topology rather than the product topology, but this has no effect on homotopy groups since the two topologies have the same compact sets, as explained in the Appendix. Similarly, the general K¨unneth formula for homology in x3.B holds for arbitrary products X \u0002 Y . The condition for a map Y!Z to be a weak homotopy equivalence involves only maps of spheres into Y and Z , but in fact weak homotopy equivalences Y!Z behave nicely with respect to maps of arbitrary CW complexes into Y and Z , not just spheres. The following proposition gives a precise statement, using the notations ƒX; Y ⁄ for the set of homotopy classes of maps X!Y and hX; Y i for the set of basepoint- preserving-homotopy classes of basepoint-preserving maps X!Y . (The notation hX; Y i is not standard, but is intended to suggest ‘pointed homotopy classes.’) Proposition 4.22. A weak homotopy equivalence f : Y -! Z induces bijections ƒX; Y ⁄!ƒX; Z⁄ and hX; Y i!hX; Zi for all CW complexes X . Proof: Consider ﬁrst ƒX; Y ⁄!ƒX; Z⁄ . We may assume f is an inclusion by replacing Z by the mapping cylinder Mf as usual. The groups ˇn—Z;Y ;y0– are then zero for all n and all basepoints y0 2 Y , so the compression lemma implies that any map X!Z can be homotoped to have image in Y . This gives surjectivity of ƒX; Y ⁄!ƒX; Z⁄ . A relative version of this argument shows injectivity since we can deform a homotopy —X \u0002 I; X \u0002 @I–!—Z; Y – to have image in Y . In the case of hX; Y i!hX; Zi the same argument applies if Mf is replaced by the reduced mapping cylinder, the quotient of Mf obtained by collapsing the segment fy0g\u0002 I to a point, for y0 the basepoint of Y . This collapsed segment then serves as the common basepoint of Y , Z , and the reduced mapping cylinder. The reduced mapping cylinder deformation retracts to Z just as the unreduced one does, but with the advantage that the basepoint does not move. tu 358 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Exercises 1. Suppose a sum f ‡ 0g of maps f; g : —In;@In–!—X; x0– is deﬁned using a coordinate of In other than the ﬁrst coordinate as in the usual sum f ‡ g . Verify the formula —f ‡ g– ‡0 —h ‡ k– … —f ‡ 0 h– ‡ —g ‡ 0 k– , and deduce that f ‡ 0 k ' f ‡ k so the two sums agree on ˇn—X; x0– , and also that g ‡0 h ' h ‡ g so the addition is abelian. 2. Show that if ' : X!Y is a homotopy equivalence, then the induced homomor- phisms '\u0003 : ˇn—X; x0–!ˇn—Y ; '—x0–– are isomorphisms for all n . [The case n … 1 is Proposition 1.18.] 3. For an H–space —X; x0– with multiplication \u0016 : X \u0002 X!X , show that the group operation in ˇn—X; x0– can also be deﬁned by the rule —f ‡ g–—x– … \u0016( f —x–; g—x–\u0001 . 4. Let p : eX!X be the universal cover of a path-connected space X . Show that under the isomorphism ˇn—X– ˇ ˇn— eX– , which holds for n \u0015 2 , the action of ˇ1—X– on ˇn—X– corresponds to the action of ˇ1—X– on ˇn— eX– induced by the ac- tion of ˇ1—X– on eX as deck transformations. More precisely, prove a formula like γp\u0003—\u000b– … p\u0003( \f eγ—γ\u0003—\u000b––\u0001 where γ 2 ˇ1—X; x0– , \u000b 2 ˇn— eX; ex0– , and γ\u0003 denotes the homomorphism induced by the action of γ on eX . 5. For a pair —X; A– of path-connected spaces, show that ˇ1—X;A;x0– can be identiﬁed in a natural way with the set of cosets \u000bH of the subgroup H ˆ ˇ1—X; x0– represented by loops in A at x0 . 6.If p : — eX; eA; ex0–!—X;A;x0– is a covering space with eA … p−1—A– , show that the map p\u0003 : ˇn— eX; eA; ex0–!ˇn—X;A;x0– is an isomorphism for all n> 1. 7. Extend the results proved near the beginning of this section for the change-of- basepoint maps \fγ to the case of relative homotopy groups. 8. Show the sequence ˇ1—X; x0– -! ˇ1—X;A;x0– @-----! ˇ0—A; x0– -! ˇ0—X; x0– is exact. 9. Suppose we deﬁne ˇ0—X;A;x0– to be the quotient set ˇ0—X; x0–=ˇ0—A; x0– ,so that the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair —X; A– extends to \u0001\u0001\u0001 !ˇ0—X; x0–!ˇ0—X;A;x0–!0. (a) Show that with this extension, the ﬁve-lemma holds for the map of long exact sequences induced by a map —X;A;x0–!—Y ;B;y0– , in the following form: One of the maps between the two sequences is a bijection if the four surrounding maps are bijections for all choices of x0 . (b) Show that the long exact sequence of a triple —X;A;B;x0– can be extended only to the term ˇ0—A; B; x0– in general, and that the ﬁve-lemma holds for this extension. 10. Show the ‘quasi-circle’ described in Exercise 7 in x1.3 has trivial homotopy groups but is not contractible, hence does not have the homotopy type of a CW complex. 11. Show that a CW complex is contractible if it is the union of an increasing sequence of subcomplexes X1 ˆ X2 ˆ\u0001\u0001\u0001 such that each inclusion Xi > Xi‡1 is nullhomotopic, a condition sometimes expressed by saying Xi is contractible in Xi‡1 . An example is Homotopy Groups Section 4.1 359 S 1 , or more generally the inﬁnite suspension S 1X of any CW complex X , the union of the iterated suspensions S nX . 12. Show that an n connected, n dimensional CW complex is contractible. 13. Use the extension lemma to show that a CW complex retracts onto any contractible subcomplex. 14. Use cellular approximation to show that the n skeletons of homotopy equivalent CW complexes without cells of dimension n ‡ 1 are also homotopy equivalent. 15. Show that every map f : S n!S n is homotopic to a multiple of the identity map by the following steps. (a) Use Lemma 4.10 (or simplicial approximation, Theorem 2C.1) to reduce to the case that there exists a point q 2 S n with f −1—q– …fp1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;pkg and f is an invertible linear map near each pi . (b) For f as in (a), consider the composition gf where g : Sn!S n collapses the complement of a small ball about q to the basepoint. Use this to reduce (a) further to the case k … 1. (c) Finish the argument by showing that an invertible n\u0002 n matrix can be joined by a path of such matrices to either the identity matrix or the matrix of a reﬂection. (Use Gaussian elimination, for example.) 16. Show that a map f : X!Y between connected CW complexes factors as a com- position X!Zn!Y where the ﬁrst map induces isomorphisms on ˇi for i \u0014 n and the second map induces isomorphisms on ˇi for i \u0015 n ‡ 1. 17. Show that if X and Y are CW complexes with Xm connected and Yn connected, then —X \u0002 Y; X _ Y– is —m ‡ n ‡ 1– connected, as is the smash product X ^ Y . 18. Give an example of a weak homotopy equivalence X!Y for which there does not exist a weak homotopy equivalence Y!X . 19. Consider the equivalence relation 'w generated by weak homotopy equivalence: X 'w Y if there are spaces X … X1;X2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;Xn … Y with weak homotopy equivalences Xi!Xi‡1 or Xi Xi‡1 for each i . Show that X 'w Y iff X and Y have a common CW approximation. 20. Show that ƒX; Y ⁄ is ﬁnite if X is a ﬁnite connected CW complex and ˇi—Y – is ﬁnite for i \u0014 dim X . 21. For this problem it is convenient to use the notations Xn for the n th stage in a Postnikov tower for X and Xm for an —m − 1– connected covering of X , where X is a connected CW complex. Show that —Xn–m ' —Xm–n , so the notation¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! X XX X n mm n Xn m is unambiguous. Thus ˇi—Xn m– ˇ ˇi—X– for m \u0014 i \u0014 n and all other homotopy groups of Xn m are zero. 22. Show that a path-connected space X is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex with countably many cells iff ˇn—X– is countable for all n . [Use the results on simplicial approximations to maps and spaces in x2.C.] 360 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory 23.If f : X!Y is a map with X and Y homotopy equivalent to CW complexes, show that the pair —Mf ;X– is homotopy equivalent to a CW pair, where Mf is the mapping cylinder. Deduce that the mapping cone Cf has the homotopy type of a CW complex. We have not yet computed any nonzero homotopy groups ˇn—X– with n \u0015 2. In Chapter 1 the two main tools we used for computing fundamental groups were van Kampen’s theorem and covering spaces. In the present section we will study the higher-dimensional analogs of these: the excision theorem for homotopy groups, and ﬁber bundles. Both of these are quite a bit weaker than their fundamental group analogs, in that they do not directly compute homotopy groups but only give relations between the homotopy groups of different spaces. Their applicability is thus more limited, but sufﬁces for a number of interesting calculations, such as ˇn—S n– and more generally the Hurewicz theorem relating the ﬁrst nonzero homotopy and homology groups of a space. Another noteworthy application is the Freudenthal suspension theorem, which leads to stable homotopy groups and in fact the whole subject of stable homotopy theory. Excision for Homotopy Groups What makes homotopy groups so much harder to compute than homology groups is the failure of the excision property. However, there is a certain dimension range, depending on connectivities, in which excision does hold for homotopy groups: Theorem 4.23. Let X be a CW complex decomposed as the union of subcomplexes A and B with nonempty connected intersection C … A \\ B .If —A; C– is m connected and —B; C– is n connected, m; n \u0015 0 , then the map ˇi—A; C–!ˇi—X; B– induced by inclusion is an isomorphism for i<m ‡ n and a surjection for i … m ‡ n . This yields the Freudenthal suspension theorem: Corollary 4.24. The suspension map ˇi—S n–!ˇi‡1—S n‡1– is an isomorphism for i< 2n − 1 and a surjection for i … 2n − 1 . More generally this holds for the suspension ˇi—X–!ˇi‡1—SX– whenever X is an —n − 1– connected CW complex. Proof: Decompose the suspension SX as the union of two cones C‡X and C−X intersecting in a copy of X . The suspension map is the same as the map ˇi—X– ˇ ˇi‡1—C‡X; X– -! ˇi‡1—SX; C−X– ˇ ˇi‡1—SX– Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 361 where the two isomorphisms come from long exact sequences of pairs and the middle map is induced by inclusion. From the long exact sequence of the pair —C\u0006X; X– we see that this pair is n connected if X is —n − 1– connected. The preceding theorem then says that the middle map is an isomorphism for i ‡ 1 < 2n and surjective for i ‡ 1 … 2n . tu Corollary 4.25. ˇn—S n– ˇ Z , generated by the identity map, for all n \u0015 1 .In particular, the degree map ˇn—S n–!Z is an isomorphism. Proof: From the preceding corollary we know that in the suspension sequence ˇ1—S 1–!ˇ2—S 2–!ˇ3—S 3–! \u0001\u0001\u0001 the ﬁrst map is surjective and all the subsequent maps are isomorphisms. Since ˇ1—S 1– is Z generated by the identity map, it follows that ˇn—S n– for n \u0015 2is a ﬁnite or inﬁnite cyclic group independent of n , generated by the identity map. The fact that this cyclic group is inﬁnite can be deduced from homology theory since there exist basepoint-preserving maps S n!S n of arbitrary degree, and degree is a homotopy invariant. Alternatively, if one wants to avoid appealing to homology theory one can use the Hopf bundle S 1!S 3!S 2 described in Example 4.45, whose long exact sequence of homotopy groups gives an isomorphism ˇ1—S 1– ˇ ˇ2—S 2– . The degree map ˇn—S n–!Z is an isomorphism since the map z , zk of S 1 has degree k , as do its iterated suspensions by Proposition 2.33. tu Proof of 4.23: We proceed by proving successively more general cases. The ﬁrst case contains the heart of the argument, and sufﬁces for the calculation of ˇn—S n– . Case 1: A is obtained from C by attaching cells em‡1 \u000b and B is obtained from C by attaching a cell en‡1 . To show surjectivity of ˇi—A; C–!ˇi—X; B– we start with a map f : —Ii;@Ii;Ji−1–!—X;B;x0– . The image of f is compact and therefore meets only ﬁnitely many of these cells em‡1 \u000b and en‡1 . By repeated applications of Lemma 4.10 we may homotope f , through maps —Ii;@Ii;Ji−1–!—X;B;x0– , so that the preimages f −1—Ñ m‡1 \u000b – and f −1—Ñ n‡1– of simplices in em‡1 \u000b and en‡1 are ﬁnite unions of convex polyhedra, on each of which f is the restriction of a linear surjection from Ri onto Rm‡1 or Rn‡1 . I I i 1 f 1 q _ () f 1 p _ ( )® _ ' Claim:If i \u0014 m‡n , then there exist points p\u000b 2 Ñ m‡1 \u000b , q 2 Ñn‡1 , and a map ' : Ii−1!ƒ0; 1– such that: (a) f −1—q– lies below the graph of ' in Ii−1 \u0002 I … Ii . (b) f −1—p\u000b– lies above the graph of ' for each \u000b . (c) ' … 0on @Ii−1 . Granting this, let ft be a homotopy of f excising the region under the graph of ' by restricting f to the region above the graph of t' for 0 \u0014 t \u0014 1 . By (b), ft—Ii−1– is disjoint from P … S\u000bfp\u000bg for all t , and by (a), f1—Ii– is disjoint from Q …fqg . This 362 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory means that in the commutative diagram at the right the given element ƒf ⁄ in¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡! i¼ ( )C,A i¼ ( ),XQ Q P P¡¡¡¡¡!i¼ ( )B,X ¡ X ¡¡ i¼ ( ),XX ¡ ¼¼ the upper-right group, when regarded as an element of the lower-right group, is equal to the element ƒf1⁄ in the image of the lower horizontal map. Since the vertical maps are isomorphisms, this proves the surjectivity statement. Now we prove the Claim. For any q 2 Ñn‡1 , f −1—q– is a ﬁnite union of convex polyhedra of dimension \u0014 i − n − 1 since f −1—Ñ n‡1– is a ﬁnite union of convex polyhedra on each of which f is the restriction of a linear surjection R i!R n‡1 . We wish to choose the points p\u000b 2 Ñ m‡1 \u000b so that not only is f −1—q– disjoint from f −1—p\u000b– for each \u000b , but also so that f −1—q– and f −1—p\u000b– have disjoint images under the projection ˇ : Ii!Ii−1 . This is equivalent to saying that f −1—p\u000b– is disjoint from T … ˇ −1( ˇ—f −1—q–– \u0001 , the union of all segments fxg\u0002 I meeting f −1—q– . This set T is a ﬁnite union of convex polyhedra of dimension \u0014 i − n since f −1—q– is a ﬁnite union of convex polyhedra of dimension \u0014 i − n − 1 . Since linear maps cannot increase dimension, f—T – \\ Ñm‡1 \u000b is also a ﬁnite union of convex polyhedra of dimension \u0014 i − n . Thus if m ‡ 1 >i − n , there is a point p\u000b 2 Ñm‡1 \u000b not in f—T – . This gives f −1—p\u000b– \\ T …; if i \u0014 m ‡ n . Hence we can choose a neighborhood U of ˇ ( f −1—q– \u0001 in In−1 disjoint from ˇ ( f −1—p\u000b–\u0001 for all \u000b . Then there exists ' : Ii−1!ƒ0; 1– having support in U , with f −1—q– lying under the graph of ' . This veriﬁes the Claim, and so ﬁnishes the proof of surjectivity in Case 1. For injectivity in Case 1 the argument is very similar. Suppose we have two maps f0;f1 : —Ii;@Ii;Ji−1–!—A; C; x0– representing elements of ˇi—A; C; x0– having the same image in ˇi—X;B;x0– . Thus there is a homotopy from f0 to f1 in the form of a map F : —Ii;@Ii;Ji−1–\u0002 ƒ0; 1⁄!—X;B;x0– . After a preliminary deformation of F via Lemma 4.10, we construct a function ' : Ii−1 \u0002 I!ƒ0; 1– separating F −1—q– from the sets F −1—p\u000b– as before. This allows us to excise F −1—q– from the domain of F , from which it follows that f0 and f1 represent the same element of ˇi—A; C; x0– . Since Ii \u0002 I now plays the role of Ii , the dimension i is replaced by i ‡ 1 and the dimension restriction i \u0014 m ‡ n becomes i ‡ 1 \u0014 m ‡ n ,or i<m ‡ n . Case 2: A is obtained from C by attaching —m ‡ 1– cells as in Case 1 and B is obtained from C by attaching cells of dimension \u0015 n ‡ 1 . To show surjectivity of ˇi—A; C–!ˇi—X; B– , consider a map f : —Ii;@Ii;Ji−1–!—X;B;x0– representing an ele- ment of ˇi—X; B– . The image of f is compact, meeting only ﬁnitely many cells, and by repeated applications of Case 1 we can push f off the cells of B − C one at a time, in order of decreasing dimension. Injectivity is quite similar, starting with a homotopy F : —Ii;@Ii;Ji−1–\u0002 ƒ0; 1⁄!—X;B;x0– and pushing this off cells of B − C . Case 3: A is obtained from C by attaching cells of dimension \u0015 m ‡ 1 and B is as in Case 2. We may assume all cells of A − C have dimension \u0014 m ‡ n ‡ 1 since higher- dimensional cells have no effect on ˇi for i \u0014 m ‡ n , by cellular approximation. Let Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 363 Ak ˆ A be the union of C with the cells of A of dimension \u0014 k and let Xk … Ak [ B . We prove the result for ˇi—Ak;C–!ˇi—Xk;B– by induction on k . The induction starts with k … m ‡ 1 , which is Case 2. For the induction step consider the following commutative diagram formed by the exact sequences of the triples —Ak;Ak−1;C– and —Xk;Xk−1;B– :¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!ik ¼ ( )C,AA¼ ( ),i 1+ -k 1 A -k 1¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!k ¼ ( C,AA¼ ( )),i -k 1 -k 1A-i 1i¼ ( )C,Ak ¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!ik ¼ ( )B,XX¼ ( ),i 1+ -k 1 X -k 1 k ¼ ( B,XX¼ ( )),i -k 1 -k 1X-i 1i¼ ( )B,X k When i<m ‡ n the ﬁrst and fourth vertical maps are isomorphisms by Case 2, while by induction the second and ﬁfth maps are isomorphisms, so the middle map is an isomorphism by the ﬁve-lemma. Similarly, when i … m ‡ n the second and fourth maps are surjective and the ﬁfth map is injective, which is enough to imply the middle map is surjective by one half of the ﬁve-lemma. When i … 2 the diagram may contain nonabelian groups and the two terms on the right may not be groups, but the ﬁve- lemma remains valid in this generality, with trivial modiﬁcations to the proof in x2.1. When i … 1 the assertion about ˇ1—A; C–!ˇ1—X; B– follows by a direct argument: If m \u0015 1 then both terms are trivial, while if m … 0 then n \u0015 1 and the result follows by cellular approximation. After these special cases we can now easily deal with the general case. The con- nectivity assumptions on the pairs —A; C– and —B; C– imply by Corollary 4.16 that they are homotopy equivalent to pairs —A0;C– and —B0;C– as in Case 3, via homotopy equiv- alences ﬁxed on C , so these homotopy equivalences ﬁt together to give a homotopy equivalence A [ B ' A0 [ B0 . Thus the general case reduces to Case 3. tu Example 4.26. The calculation of ˇn—S n– can be extended to show that ˇn—W \u000b S n \u000b – for n \u0015 2 is free abelian with basis the homotopy classes of the inclusions S n \u000b > W \u000b S n \u000b . Suppose ﬁrst that there are only ﬁnitely many summands S n \u000b . We can regard W \u000b S n \u000b as the n skeleton of the product Q \u000b S n \u000b , where S n \u000b is given its usual CW structure and Q \u000b S n \u000b has the product CW structure. Since Q \u000b S n \u000b has cells only in dimen- sions a multiple of n , the pair —Q \u000b S n \u000b ; W \u000b S n \u000b – is —2n − 1– connected. Hence from the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for this pair we see that the inclusion W \u000b S n \u000b > Q \u000b S n \u000b induces an isomorphism on ˇn if n \u0015 2 . By Proposition 4.2 we have ˇn—Q \u000b S n \u000b – ˇ L \u000b ˇn—S n \u000b – , a free abelian group with basis the inclusions S n \u000b > Q \u000b S n \u000b , so the same is true for W \u000b S n \u000b . This takes care of the case of ﬁnitely many S n \u000b ’s. To reduce the case of inﬁnitely many summands S n \u000b to the ﬁnite case, consider the homomorphism Ø : L \u000b ˇn—S n \u000b –!ˇn—W \u000b S n \u000b – induced by the inclusions S n \u000b > W \u000b S n \u000b . Then Ø is surjective since any map f : S n! W \u000b S n \u000b has compact image contained in the wedge sum of ﬁnitely many S n \u000b ’s, so by the ﬁnite case already proved, ƒf ⁄ is in the image of Ø . Similarly, a nullhomotopy of f has compact image contained in a ﬁnite wedge sum of S n \u000b ’s, so the ﬁnite case also implies that Ø is injective. 364 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Example 4.27. Let us show that ˇn—S 1 _ S n– for n \u0015 2 is free abelian on a countably inﬁnite number of generators. By Proposition 4.1 we may compute ˇi—S 1 _ S n– for i \u0015 2 by passing to the universal cover. This consists of a copy of R with a sphere S n k attached at each integer point k 2 R , so it is homotopy equivalent to W k S n k . The preceding Example 4.26 says that ˇn—W k S n k – is free abelian with basis represented by the inclusions of the wedge summands. So a basis for ˇn of the universal cover of S 1 _ S n is represented by maps that lift the maps obtained from the inclusion S n > S 1 _ S n by the action of the various elements of ˇ1—S 1 _ S n– ˇ Z . This means that ˇn—S 1 _ S n– is a free Zƒˇ1—S 1 _ S n–⁄ module on a single basis element, the homotopy class of the inclusion S n > S 1 _ S n . Writing a generator of ˇ1—S 1 _ S n– as t , the group ring Zƒˇ1—S 1 _ S n–⁄ becomes Zƒt; t−1⁄ , the Laurent polynomials in t and t−1 with Z coefﬁcients, and we have ˇn—S 1 _ S n– ˇ Zƒt; t−1⁄ . This example shows that the homotopy groups of a ﬁnite CW complex need not be ﬁnitely generated, in contrast to the homology groups. However, if we restrict attention to spaces with trivial action of ˇ1 on all ˇn ’s, then a theorem of Serre, proved in [SSAT], says that the homotopy groups of such a space are ﬁnitely generated iff the homology groups are ﬁnitely generated. In this example, ˇn—S 1 _ S n– is ﬁnitely generated as a Zƒˇ1⁄ module, but there are ﬁnite CW complexes where even this fails. This happens in fact for ˇ3—S 1 _ S 2– , according to Exercise 38 at the end of this section. In x4.A we construct more com- plicated examples for each ˇn with n> 1 , in particular for ˇ2 . A useful tool for more complicated calculations is the following general result: Proposition 4.28. If a CW pair —X; A– is r connected and A is s connected, with r; s \u0015 0 , then the map ˇi—X; A–!ˇi—X=A– induced by the quotient map X!X=A is an isomorphism for i \u0014 r ‡ s and a surjection for i … r ‡ s ‡ 1 . Proof: Consider X [ CA , the complex obtained from X by attaching a cone CA along A ˆ X . Since CA is a contractible subcomplex of X [ CA , the quotient map X [ CA!—X [ CA–=CA … X=A is a homotopy equivalence by Proposition 0.17. So we have a commutative diagram¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! i X¼ ()AX¼i (), CA CA,[ i X¼ ()CA[ i X¼ ()CA CA[ / i X¼ ()A/= ¼ ¼ where the vertical isomorphism comes from a long exact sequence. Now apply the excision theorem to the ﬁrst map in the diagram, using the fact that —CA; A– is —s ‡ 1– connected if A is s connected, which comes from the exact sequence for the pair —CA; A– . tu Example 4.29. Suppose X is obtained from a wedge of spheres W \u000b S n \u000b by attaching cells en‡1 \f via basepoint-preserving maps '\f : S n!W \u000b S n \u000b , with n \u0015 2 . By cellular Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 365 approximation we know that ˇi—X– … 0 for i<n , and we shall show that ˇn—X– is the quotient of the free abelian group ˇn(W \u000b S n \u000b \u0001 ˇ L \u000b Z by the subgroup generated by the classes ƒ'\f⁄ . Any subgroup can be realized in this way, by choosing maps '\f to represent a set of generators for the subgroup, so it follows that every abelian group can be realized as ˇn—X– for such a space X … (W \u000b S n \u000b \u0001 S \f en‡1 \f . This is the higher-dimensional analog of the construction in Corollary 1.28 of a 2 dimensional CW complex with prescribed fundamental group. To see that ˇn—X– is as claimed, consider the following portion of the long exact sequence of the pair —X; W \u000b S n \u000b – : ˇn‡1—X; W \u000b S n \u000b – @-------------! ˇn—W \u000b S n \u000b – --------! ˇn—X– ----! 0 The quotient X=W \u000b S n \u000b is a wedge of spheres S n‡1 \f , so the preceding proposition and Example 4.26 imply that ˇn‡1—X; W \u000b S n \u000b – is free with basis the characteristic maps of the cells en‡1 \f . The boundary map @ takes these to the classes ƒ'\f⁄ , and the result follows. Eilenberg–MacLane Spaces A space X having just one nontrivial homotopy group ˇn—X– ˇ G is called an Eilenberg–MacLane space K—G; n– . The case n … 1 was considered in x1.B, where the condition that ˇi—X– … 0 for i> 1 was replaced by the condition that X have a contractible universal cover, which is equivalent for spaces that have a universal cover of the homotopy type of a CW complex. We can build a CW complex K—G; n– for arbitrary G and n , assuming G is abelian if n> 1 , in the following way. To begin, let X be an —n − 1– connected CW complex of dimension n ‡ 1 such that ˇn—X– ˇ G , as was constructed in Example 4.29 above when n> 1 and in Corollary 1.28 when n … 1 . Then we showed in Example 4.17 how to attach higher-dimensional cells to X to make ˇi trivial for i>n without affecting ˇn or the lower homotopy groups. By taking products of K—G; n– ’s for varying n we can then realize any sequence of groups Gn , abelian for n> 1 , as the homotopy groups ˇn of a space. A fair number of K—G; 1– ’s arise naturally in a variety of contexts, and a few of these are mentioned in x1.B. By contrast, naturally occurring K—G; n– ’s for n \u0015 2 are rare. It seems the only real example is CP1 , which is a K—Z; 2– as we shall see in Example 4.50. One could of course trivially generalize this example by taking a product of CP1 ’s to get a K—G; 2– with G a product of Z ’s. Actually there is a fairly natural construction of a K—Z;n– for arbitrary n , the inﬁnite symmetric product SP —S n– deﬁned in x3.C. In x4.K we prove that the functor SP has the surprising property of converting homology groups into homotopy groups, namely ˇi( SP —X– \u0001 ˇ Hi—X; Z– for all i> 0 and all connected CW complexes X . Taking X to be a sphere, we deduce that SP —S n– is a K—Z;n– . More generally, SP ( M—G; n–\u0001 is a K—G; n– for each Moore space M—G; n– . 366 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Having shown the existence of K—G; n– ’s, we now consider the uniqueness ques- tion, which has the nicest possible answer: Proposition 4.30. The homotopy type of a CW complex K—G; n– is uniquely deter- mined by G and n . The proof will be based on a more technical statement: Lemma 4.31. Let X be a CW complex of the form (W \u000b S n \u000b \u0001 S \f en‡1 \f for some n \u0015 1 . Then for every homomorphism : ˇn—X–!ˇn—Y – with Y path-connected there ex- ists a map f : X!Y with f\u0003 … . Proof: To begin, let f send the natural basepoint of W \u000b S n \u000b to a chosen basepoint y0 2 Y . Extend f over each sphere S n \u000b via a map representing —ƒi\u000b⁄– where i\u000b is the inclusion S n \u000b > X . Thus for the map f : Xn!Y constructed so far we have f\u0003—ƒi\u000b⁄– … —ƒi\u000b⁄– for all \u000b , hence f\u0003—ƒ'⁄– … —ƒ'⁄– for all basepoint-preserving maps ' : S n!Xn since the i\u000b ’s generate ˇn—Xn– . To extend f over a cell en‡1 \f all we need is that the composition of the attaching map '\f : S n!Xn for this cell with f be nullhomotopic in Y . But this composition f'\f represents f\u0003—ƒ'\f⁄– … —ƒ'\f⁄– , and —ƒ'\f⁄– … 0 because ƒ'\f⁄ is zero in ˇn—X– since '\f is nullhomotopic in X via the characteristic map of en‡1 \f . Thus we obtain an extension f : X!Y . This has f\u0003 … since the elements ƒi\u000b⁄ generate ˇn—Xn– and hence also ˇn—X– by cellular approximation. tu Proof of 4.30: Suppose K and K0 are K—G; n– CW complexes. Since homotopy equiv- alence is an equivalence relation, there is no loss of generality if we assume K is a particular K—G; n– , namely one constructed from a space X as in the lemma by at- taching cells of dimension n ‡ 2 and greater. By the lemma there is a map f : X!K0 inducing an isomorphism on ˇn . To extend this f over K we proceed inductively. For each cell en‡2 , the composition of its attaching map with f is nullhomotopic in K0 since ˇn‡1—K0– … 0, so f extends over this cell. The same argument applies for all the higher-dimensional cells in turn. The resulting f : K!K0 is a homotopy equivalence since it induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups. tu The Hurewicz Theorem Using the calculations of homotopy groups done above we can easily prove the simplest and most often used cases of the Hurewicz theorem: Theorem 4.32. If a space X is —n − 1– connected, n \u0015 2 , then eHi—X– … 0 for i<n and ˇn—X– ˇ Hn—X– . If a pair —X; A– is —n − 1– connected, n \u0015 2 , with A simply- connected and nonempty, then Hi—X; A– … 0 for i<n and ˇn—X; A– ˇ Hn—X; A– . Thus the ﬁrst nonzero homotopy and homology groups of a simply-connected space occur in the same dimension and are isomorphic. One cannot expect any nice Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 367 relationship between ˇi—X– and Hi—X– beyond this. For example, S n has trivial ho- mology groups above dimension n but many nontrivial homotopy groups in this range when n \u0015 2 . In the other direction, Eilenberg–MacLane spaces such as CP1 have triv- ial higher homotopy groups but many nontrivial homology groups. The theorem can sometimes be used to compute ˇ2—X– if X is a path-connected space that is nice enough to have a universal cover. For if eX is the universal cover, then ˇ2—X– ˇ ˇ2— eX– and the latter group is isomorphic to H2— eX– by the Hurewicz theorem. So if one can understand eX well enough to compute H2— eX– , one can compute ˇ2—X– . In the part of the theorem dealing with relative groups, notice that X must be simply-connected as well as A since —X; A– is 1 connected by hypothesis. There is a more general version of the relative Hurewicz theorem given later in Theorem 4.37 that allows A and X to be nonsimply-connected, but this requires ˇn—X; A– to be replaced by a certain quotient group. Proof: We may assume X is a CW complex and —X; A– is a CW pair by taking CW approximations to X and —X; A– . For CW pairs the relative case then reduces to the absolute case since ˇi—X; A– ˇ ˇi—X=A– for i \u0014 n by Proposition 4.28, while Hi—X; A– ˇ eHi—X=A– for all i by Proposition 2.22. In the absolute case we can apply Corollary 4.16 to replace X by a homotopy equivalent CW complex with —n − 1– skeleton a point, hence eHi—X– … 0 for i<n . To show ˇn—X– ˇ Hn—X– , we can further simplify by throwing away cells of dimen- sion greater than n ‡ 1 since these have no effect on ˇn or Hn . Thus X has the form (W \u000b S n \u000b \u0001 S \f en‡1 \f . We may assume the attaching maps '\f of the cells en‡1 \f are basepoint-preserving since this is what the proof of Corollary 4.16 gives. Ex- ample 4.29 then applies to compute ˇn—X– as the cokernel of the boundary map ˇn‡1—X; Xn–!ˇn—Xn– , a map L \f Z!L \u000b Z . This is the same as the cellular bound- ary map d : Hn‡1—Xn‡1;Xn–!Hn—Xn;Xn−1– since for a cell en‡1 \f , the coefﬁcients of den‡1 \f are the degrees of the compositions q\u000b'\f where q\u000b collapses all n cells ex- cept en \u000b to a point, and the isomorphism ˇn—S n– ˇ Z in Corollary 4.25 is given by degree. Since there are no —n − 1– cells, we have Hn—X– ˇ Coker d . tu Since homology groups are usually more computable than homotopy groups, the following version of Whitehead’s theorem is often easier to apply: Corollary 4.33. A map f : X!Y between simply-connected CW complexes is a ho- motopy equivalence if f\u0003 : Hn—X–!Hn—Y – is an isomorphism for each n . Proof: After replacing Y by the mapping cylinder Mf we may take f to be an inclusion X > Y . Since X and Y are simply-connected, we have ˇ1—Y ; X– … 0 . The relative Hurewicz theorem then says that the ﬁrst nonzero ˇn—Y ; X– is isomorphic to the ﬁrst nonzero Hn—Y ; X– . All the groups Hn—Y ; X– are zero from the long exact sequence of homology, so all the groups ˇn—Y ; X– also vanish. This means that the inclusion 368 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory X > Y induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups, and therefore this inclusion is a homotopy equivalence. tu Example 4.34: Uniqueness of Moore Spaces. Let us show that the homotopy type of a CW complex Moore space M—G; n– is uniquely determined by G and n if n> 1, so M—G; n– is simply-connected. Let X be an M—G; n– as constructed in Example 2.40 by attaching —n ‡ 1– cells to a wedge sum of n spheres, and let Y be any other M—G; n– CW complex. By Lemma 4.31 there is a map f : X!Y inducing an isomorphism on ˇn . If we can show that f also induces an isomorphism on Hn , then the preceding corollary will imply the result. One way to show that f induces an isomorphism on Hn would be to use a more reﬁned version of the Hurewicz theorem giving an isomorphism between ˇn and Hn that is natural with respect to maps between spaces, as in Theorem 4.37 below. However, here is a direct argument which avoids naturality questions. For the mapping cylinder Mf we know that ˇi—Mf ;X– … 0 for i \u0014 n . If this held also for i … n ‡ 1 then the relative Hurewicz theorem would say that Hi—Mf ;X– … 0 for i \u0014 n ‡ 1 and hence that f\u0003 would be an isomorphism on Hn . To make this argument work, let us temporarily enlarge Y by attaching —n ‡ 2– cells to make ˇn‡1 zero. The new mapping cylinder Mf then has ˇn‡1—Mf ;X– … 0 from the long exact sequence of the pair. So for the enlarged Y the map f induces an isomorphism on Hn . But attaching —n ‡ 2– cells has no effect on Hn , so the original f : X!Y had to be an isomorphism on Hn . It is certainly possible for a map of nonsimply-connected spaces to induce isomor- phisms on all homology groups but not on homotopy groups. Nonsimply-connected acyclic spaces, for which the inclusion of a point induces an isomorphism on ho- mology, exhibit this phenomenon in its purest form. Perhaps the simplest nontrivial acyclic space is the 2 dimensional complex constructed in Example 2.38 with funda- mental group a; b jjjj a5 … b3 … —ab– 2 \u000b of order 120. It is also possible for a map between spaces with abelian fundamental groups to induce isomorphisms on homology but not on higher homotopy groups, as the next example shows. Example 4.35. We construct a space X … —S 1 _ S n– [ en‡1 , for arbitrary n> 1 , such that the inclusion S 1 > X induces an isomorphism on all homology groups and on ˇi for i<n , but not on ˇn . From Example 4.27 we have ˇn—S 1 _ S n– ˇ Zƒt; t−1⁄ . Let X be obtained from S 1 _ S n by attaching a cell en‡1 via a map S n!S 1 _ S n corresponding to 2t − 1 2 Zƒt; t−1⁄ . By looking in the universal cover we see that ˇn—X– ˇ Zƒt; t−1⁄=—2t − 1– , where —2t − 1– denotes the ideal in Zƒt; t−1⁄ generated by 2t − 1 . Note that setting t … 1=2 embeds Zƒt; t−1⁄=—2t − 1– in Q as the subring Zƒ1=2⁄ consisting of rationals with denominator a power of 2 . From the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the —n − 1– connected pair —X; S 1– we see that the inclusion Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 369 S 1 > X induces an isomorphism on ˇi for i<n . The fact that this inclusion also in- duces isomorphisms on all homology groups can be deduced from cellular homology. The key point is that the cellular boundary map Hn‡1—Xn‡1;Xn–!Hn—Xn;Xn−1– is an isomorphism since the degree of the composition of the attaching map S n!S 1 _ S n of en‡1 with the collapse S 1 _ S n!S n is 2 − 1 … 1. This example relies heavily on the nontriviality of the action of ˇ1—X– on ˇn—X– , so one might ask whether the simple-connectivity assumption in Corollary 4.33 can be weakened to trivial action of ˇ1 on all ˇn ’s. This is indeed the case, as we will show in Proposition 4.74. The form of the Hurewicz theorem given above asserts merely the existence of an isomorphism between homotopy and homology groups, but one might want a more precise statement which says that a particular map is an isomorphism. In fact, there are always natural maps from homotopy groups to homology groups, deﬁned in the following way. Thinking of ˇn—X;A;x0– for n> 0 as homotopy classes of maps f : —Dn;@Dn;s0–!—X;A;x0– , the Hurewicz map h : ˇn—X;A;x0–!Hn—X; A– is de- ﬁned by h—ƒf ⁄– … f\u0003—\u000b– where \u000b is a ﬁxed generator of Hn—Dn;@Dn– ˇ Z and f\u0003 : Hn—Dn;@Dn–!Hn—X; A– is induced by f . If we have a homotopy f ' g through maps —Dn;@Dn;s0–!—X;A;x0– , or even through maps —Dn;@Dn–!—X; A– not pre- serving the basepoint, then f\u0003 … g\u0003 ,so h is well-deﬁned. Proposition 4.36. The Hurewicz map h : ˇn—X;A;x0–!Hn—X; A– is a homomor- phism, assuming n> 1 so that ˇn—X;A;x0– is a group. Proof: It sufﬁces to show that for maps f; g : —Dn;@Dn–!—X; A– , the induced maps on homology satisfy —f ‡ g–\u0003 … f\u0003 ‡ g\u0003 , for if this is the case then h—ƒf ‡ g⁄– … —f ‡ g–\u0003—\u000b– … f\u0003—\u000b– ‡ g\u0003—\u000b– … h—ƒf ⁄– ‡ h—ƒg⁄– . Our proof that —f ‡ g–\u0003 … f\u0003 ‡ g\u0003 will in fact work for any homology theory. Let c : Dn!Dn _ Dn be the map collapsing the equatorial Dn−1 to a point, and let q1;q2 : Dn _ Dn!Dn be the quotient maps onto the two summands, collapsing the other summand to a point. We then have a diagram () __ _ ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! © © ¤ ¤ ¤ cf g qq 1 ¤2 ¼ DH ()n n D n , @ DH ()n n D n , @ DH ()n n D n , @ XH ()n A,DH ()n n D n D n , @D n @ The map q1\u0003 \b q2\u0003 is an isomorphism with inverse i1\u0003 ‡ i2\u0003 where i1 and i2 are the inclusions of the two summands Dn > Dn _ Dn . Since q1c and q2c are homotopic to the identity through maps —Dn;@Dn–!—Dn;@Dn– , the composition —q1\u0003 \b q2\u0003–c\u0003 is the diagonal map x , —x; x– . From the equalities —f _ g–i1 … f and —f _ g–i2 … g we deduce that —f _ g–\u0003—i1\u0003 ‡ i2\u0003– sends —x; 0– to f\u0003—x– and —0;x– to g\u0003—x– , hence —x; x– to f\u0003—x– ‡ g\u0003—x– . Thus the composition across the top of the diagram is 370 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory x , f\u0003—x– ‡ g\u0003—x– . On the other hand, f ‡ g … —f _ g–c , so this composition is also —f ‡ g–\u0003 . tu There is also an absolute Hurewicz map h : ˇn—X; x0–!Hn—X– deﬁned in a simi- lar way by setting h—ƒf ⁄– … f\u0003—\u000b– for f : —S n;s0–!—X; x0– and \u000b a chosen generator of Hn—S n– . For example, if X … S n then f\u0003—\u000b– is —deg f–\u000b by the deﬁnition of de- gree, so we can view h in this case as the degree map ˇn—S n–!Z , which we know is an isomorphism by Corollary 4.25. The proof of the preceding proposition is readily modiﬁed to show that the absolute h is a homomorphism for n \u0015 1. The absolute and relative Hurewicz maps can be combined in a diagram of long exact sequences hh h h -n 1... ...¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!AAH ()¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! XHnnn ()XH () , ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!

With more care in the choice of the generators \u000b it can be made to commute exactly. Another elementary property of Hurewicz maps is that they are natural: A map f : —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– h¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡!nnXH () ¡¡¡!X()n ,¼ 0x h¡¡¡¡¡! YH () Y()n ,¼ 0y f¤ f¤induces a commutative diagram as at the right, and similarly in the relative case. It is easy to construct nontrivial elements of the kernel of the Hurewicz homo- morphism h : ˇn—X; x0–!Hn—X– if ˇ1—X; x0– acts nontrivially on ˇn—X; x0– , namely elements of the form ƒγ⁄ƒf ⁄−ƒf ⁄ . This is because γf and f , viewed as maps S n!X , are homotopic if we do not require the basepoint to be ﬁxed during the homotopy, so —γf –\u0003—\u000b– … f\u0003—\u000b– for \u000b a generator of Hn—S n– . Similarly in the relative case the kernel of h : ˇn—X;A;x0–!Hn—X; A– contains the elements of the form ƒγ⁄ƒf ⁄ − ƒf ⁄ for ƒγ⁄ 2 ˇ1—A; x0– . For example the Hurewicz map ˇn—S 1 _ S n;S 1–!Hn—S 1 _ S n;S 1– is the homomorphism Zƒt; t−1⁄!Z sending all powers of t to 1 . Since the pair —S 1 _ S n;S 1– is —n − 1– connected, this example shows that the hypothesis ˇ1—A; x0– … 0 in the relative form of the Hurewicz theorem proved earlier cannot be dropped. If we deﬁne ˇ 0 n—X;A;x0– to be the quotient group of ˇn—X;A;x0– obtained by factoring out the subgroup generated by all elements of the form ƒγ⁄ƒf ⁄ − ƒf ⁄ , or the normal subgroup generated by such elements in the case n … 2 when ˇ2—X;A;x0– may not be abelian, then h induces a homomorphism h0 : ˇ 0 n—X;A;x0–!Hn—X; A– . The general form of the Hurewicz theorem deals with this homomorphism: Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 371 Theorem 4.37. If —X; A– is an —n − 1– connected pair of path-connected spaces with n \u0015 2 and A ﬂ ; , then h 0 : ˇ 0 n—X;A;x0–!Hn—X; A– is an isomorphism and Hi—X; A– … 0 for i<n . Note that this statement includes the absolute form of the theorem by taking A to be the basepoint. Before starting the proof of this general Hurewicz theorem we have a preliminary step: Lemma 4.38. If X is a connected CW complex to which cells en \u000b are attached for a ﬁxed n \u0015 2 , forming a CW complex W … X S \u000b en \u000b , then ˇn—W ; X– is a free ˇ1—X– module with basis the homotopy classes of the characteristic maps Ø\u000b of the cells en \u000b , provided that the map ˇ1—X–!ˇ1—W – induced by inclusion is an isomor- phism. In particular, this is always the case if n \u0015 3 . In the general n … 2 case, ˇ2—W ; X– is generated by the classes of the characteristic maps of the cells e2 \u000b to- gether with their images under the action of ˇ1—X– . If the characteristic maps Ø\u000b : —Dn;@Dn–!—W ; X– do not take a basepoint s0 in @Dn to the basepoint x0 in X , then they will deﬁne elements of ˇn—W ;X;x0– only after we choose change-of-basepoint paths from the points Ø\u000b—s0– to x0 . Differ- ent choices of such paths yield elements of ˇn—W ;X;x0– related by the action of ˇ1—X; x0– , so the basis for ˇn—W ;X;x0– is well-deﬁned up to multiplication by in- vertible elements of Zƒˇ1—X–⁄ . The situation when n … 2 and the map ˇ1—X–!ˇ1—W – is not an isomorphism is more complicated because the relative ˇ2 can be nonabelian in this case. Whitehead analyzed what happens here and showed that ˇ2—W ; X– has the structure of a ‘free crossed ˇ1—X– module.’ See [Whitehead 1949] or [Sieradski 1993]. Proof: Since W=X … W \u000b S n \u000b , we have ˇn—W ; X– ˇ ˇn—W \u000b S n \u000b – when X is simply- connected, by Proposition 4.28. The conclusion of the lemma in this case is then immediate from Example 4.26. When X is not simply-connected but the inclusion X>W induces an isomorphism on ˇ1 , then the universal cover of W is obtained from the universal cover of X by attaching n cells lifting the cells en \u000b . If we choose one such lift ee n \u000b of en \u000b , then all the other lifts are the images γ ee n \u000b of ee n \u000b under the deck transformations γ 2 ˇ1—X– . The special case proved in the preceding paragraph shows that the relative ˇn for the universal cover is the free abelian group with basis corresponding to the cells γ ee n \u000b .By the relative version of Proposition 4.1, the projection of the universal cover of W onto W induces an isomorphism on relative ˇn ’s, so ˇn—W ; X– is free abelian with basis the classes ƒγen \u000b⁄ as γ ranges over ˇ1—X– , or in other words the free ˇ1—X– module with basis the cells en \u000b . It remains to consider the n … 2 case in general. Since both of the pairs —W ; X1– and —X1 S \u000b e2 \u000b;X1– are 1 connected, the homotopy excision theorem implies that the 372 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory map ˇ2—X1 S\u000b e2 \u000b;X1–!ˇ2—W ; X– is surjective. This gives a reduction to the case that X is 1 dimensional. We may also assume the 2 cells e2 \u000b are attached along loops passing through the basepoint 0 cell x0 , since this can be achieved by homotopy of the attaching maps, which does not affect the homotopy type of the pair —W ; X– . In the closure of each 2 cell e2 \u000b choose an embedded disk D2 \u000b which contains x0 but is otherwise contained entirely in the interior of e2 \u000b . Let Y … X S\u000b D2 \u000b , the wedge sum of X with the disks D2 \u000b , and let Z … W − S \u000b int—D2 \u000b– ,so Y and Z are 2 dimensional CW complexes with a common 1 skeleton Y 1 … Z 1 … Y \\Z … X W \u000b @D2 \u000b . The inclusion —W ; X–>—W ; Z– is a homotopy equivalence of pairs. Homotopy excision gives a surjection ˇ2—Y ; Y 1–!ˇ2—W ; Z– . The universal cover eY of Y is obtained from the universal cover eX of X by taking the wedge sum with lifts eD2 \u000b\f of the disks D2 \u000b . Hence we have isomorphisms ˇ2—Y ; Y 1– ˇ ˇ2— eY; eY 1– where eY 1 is the 1 skeleton of eY ˇ ˇ2—W \u000b\f eD2 \u000b\f; W \u000b\f @ eD2 \u000b\f– since eX is contractible ˇ ˇ1—W \u000b\f @ eD2 \u000b\f– since W \u000b\f eD2 \u000b\f is contractible This last group is free with basis the loops @ eD2 \u000b\f , so the inclusions eD2 \u000b\f > W \u000b\f eD2 \u000b\f form a basis for ˇ2—W \u000b\f eD2 \u000b\f; W \u000b\f @ eD2 \u000b\f– . This implies that ˇ2—Y ; Y 1– is generated by the inclusions D2 \u000b > Y and their images under the action of loops in X . The same is true for ˇ2—W ; Z– via the surjection ˇ2—Y ; Y 1–!ˇ2—W ; Z– . Using the isomorphism ˇ2—W ; Z– ˇ ˇ2—W ; X– , we conclude that ˇ2—W ; X– is generated by the characteristic maps of the cells e2 \u000b and their images under the action of ˇ1—X– . tu Proof of the general Hurewicz Theorem: As in the earlier form of the theorem we may assume —X; A– is a CW pair such that the cells of X − A have dimension \u0015 n . We ﬁrst prove the theorem assuming that ˇ1—A–!ˇ1—X– is an isomorphism. This is always the case if n \u0015 3 , so this case will ﬁnish the proof except when n … 2. We may assume also that X … Xn‡1 since higher-dimensional cells have no effect on ˇn or Hn . Consider the commutative diagram hh h¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! A 0¡¡¡¡¡!

The left- hand h0 is an isomorphism since by the preceding lemma, ˇn‡1—X; Xn [ A– is a free ˇ1 module with basis the characteristic maps of the —n ‡ 1– cells of X − A , so ˇ 0 n‡1—X; Xn [ A– is a free abelian group with the same basis, and Hn‡1—X; Xn [ A– is also free with basis the —n ‡ 1– cells of X − A . Similarly, the lemma implies that Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 373 the middle h 0 is an isomorphism since the assumption that ˇ1—A–!ˇ1—X– is an isomorphism implies that ˇ1—A–!ˇ1—Xn [ A– is injective, hence an isomorphism if n \u0015 2. A simple diagram chase now shows that the right-hand h 0 is an isomorphism. Namely, surjectivity follows since Hn—Xn [ A; A–!Hn—X; A– is surjective and the middle h0 is an isomorphism. For injectivity, take an element x 2 ˇ 0 n—X; A– with h0—x– … 0 . The map i 0 \u0003 is surjective since i\u0003 is, so x … i0 \u0003—y– for some element y 2 ˇ 0 n—Xn [ A; A– . Since the ﬁrst two maps h 0 are isomorphisms and the bottom row is exact, there is a z 2 ˇ 0 n‡1—X; Xn [ A– with @0—z– … y . Hence x … 0 since i\u0003@ … 0 implies i 0 \u0003@0 … 0. It remains to prove the theorem when n … 2 and ˇ1—A–!ˇ1—X– is not an isomor- phism. The proof above will apply once we show that the middle h0 in the diagram is an isomorphism. The preceding lemma implies that ˇ 0 2—X2 [ A; A– is generated by characteristic maps of the 2 cells of X − A . The images of these generators under h 0 form a basis for H2—X2 [ A; A– . Thus h 0 is a homomorphism from a group which, by the lemma below, is abelian to a free abelian group taking a set of generators to a basis, hence h0 is an isomorphism. tu Lemma 4.39. For any —X;A;x0– , the formula a ‡ b − a … —@a–b holds for all a; b 2 ˇ2—X;A;x0– , where @ : ˇ2—X;A;x0–!ˇ1—A; x0– is the usual boundary map and —@a–b denotes the action of @a on b . Hence ˇ 0 2—X;A;x0– is abelian. Here the ‘ ‡ ’ and ‘ − ’in a ‡ b − a refer to the group operation in the nonabelian group ˇ2—X;A;x0– . Proof: The formula is obtained by constructing a homotopy from a ‡ b − a to —@a–b as indicated in the pictures below. tu a aa b bb b a a ax0 @a @a @a @a @a@a _ _ _ The Plus Construction There are quite a few situations in algebraic topology where having a nontriv- ial fundamental group complicates matters considerably. We shall next describe a construction which in certain circumstances allows one to modify a space so as to eliminate its fundamental group, or at least simplify it, without affecting homology or cohomology. Here is the simplest case: 374 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Proposition 4.40. Let X be a connected CW complex with H1—X– … 0 . Then there is a simply-connected CW complex X‡ and a map X!X‡ inducing isomorphisms on all homology groups. Proof: Choose loops '\u000b : S 1!X1 generating ˇ1—X– and use these to attach cells e2 \u000b to X to form a simply-connected CW complex X0 . The homology exact sequence 0 -! H2—X– -! H2—X0– -! H2—X0;X– -! 0 … H1—X– splits since H2—X0;X– is free with basis the cells e2 \u000b . Thus we have an isomorphism H2—X0– ˇ H2—X–\b H2—X0;X– . Since X0 is simply-connected, the Hurewicz theorem gives an isomorphism H2—X0– ˇ ˇ2—X0– , and so we may represent a basis for the free summand H2—X0;X– by maps \u000b : S 2!X0 . We may assume these are cellular maps, and then use them to attach cells e3 \u000b to X0 forming a simply-connected CW complex X‡ , with the inclusion X > X‡ an isomorphism on all homology groups. tu In the preceding proposition, the condition H1—X– … 0 means that ˇ1—X– is equal to its commutator subgroup, that is, ˇ1—X– is a perfect group. Suppose more gen- erally that X is a connected CW complex and H ˆ ˇ1—X– is a perfect subgroup. Let p : eX!X be the covering space corresponding to H ,so ˇ1— eX– ˇ H is per- fect and H1— eX– … 0 . From the previous proposition we get an inclusion eX > eX‡ . Let X‡ be obtained from the disjoint union of eX‡ and the mapping cylinder Mp by identifying the copies of eX in these two spaces. Thus we have the commutative diagram of inclusion maps shown¡!¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!X MXX X p + +»» ' at the right. From the van Kampen theorem, the induced map ˇ1—X–!ˇ1—X‡– is surjective with kernel the normal subgroup generated by H . Further, since X‡=Mp is homeomorphic to eX‡= eX we have H\u0003—X‡;Mp– … H\u0003— eX‡; eX– … 0 , so the map X!X‡ induces an isomorphism on homology. This construction X!X‡ , killing a perfect subgroup of ˇ1—X– while preserving homology, is known as the Quillen plus construction. In some of the main applica- tions X is a K—G; 1– where G has perfect commutator subgroup, so the map X!X‡ abelianizes ˇ1 while preserving homology. The space X‡ need no longer be a K—ˇ ; 1– , and in fact its homotopy groups can be quite interesting. The most striking example is G … Ö1 , the inﬁnite symmetric group consisting of permutations of 1; 2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ﬁxing all but ﬁnitely many n ’s, with commutator subgroup the inﬁnite alternating group A1 , which is perfect. In this case a famous theorem of Barratt-Kahn-Priddy and Quillen says that the homotopy groups ˇi—K—Ö1; 1– ‡– are the stable homotopy groups of spheres! There are limits, however, on which subgroups of ˇ1—X– can be killed without affecting the homology of X . For example, for X … S 1 _ S 1 it is impossible to kill the commutator subgroup of ˇ1—X– while preserving homology. In fact, by Exercise 23 Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 375 at the end of this section every space with fundamental group Z\u0002 Z must have H2 nontrivial. Fiber Bundles A ‘short exact sequence of spaces’ A > X!X=A gives rise to a long exact se- quence of homology groups, but not to a long exact sequence of homotopy groups due to the failure of excision. However, there is a different sort of ‘short exact sequence of spaces’ that does give a long exact sequence of homotopy groups. This sort of short exact sequence F -! E p -----! B , called a ﬁber bundle, is distinguished from the type A > X!X=A in that it has more homogeneity: All the subspaces p−1—b– ˆ E , which are called ﬁbers, are homeomorphic. For example, E could be the product F \u0002 B with p : E!B the projection. General ﬁber bundles can be thought of as twisted products. Familiar examples are the M¨obius band, which is a twisted annulus with line segments as ﬁbers, and the Klein bottle, which is a twisted torus with circles as ﬁbers. The topological homogeneity of all the ﬁbers of a ﬁber bundle is rather like the algebraic homogeneity in a short exact sequence of groups 0!K -! G p -----! H!0 where the ‘ﬁbers’ p−1—h– are the cosets of K in G . In a few ﬁber bundles F!E!B the space E is actually a group, F is a subgroup (though seldom a normal subgroup), and B is the space of left or right cosets. One of the nicest such examples is the Hopf bundle S 1!S 3!S 2 where S 3 is the group of quaternions of unit norm and S 1 is the subgroup of unit complex numbers. For this bundle, the long exact sequence of homotopy groups takes the form \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! ˇi—S 1– -! ˇi—S 3– -! ˇi—S 2– -! ˇi−1—S 1– -! ˇi−1—S 3– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 In particular, the exact sequence gives an isomorphism ˇ2—S 2– ˇ ˇ1—S 1– since the two adjacent terms ˇ2—S 3– and ˇ1—S 3– are zero by cellular approximation. Thus we have a direct homotopy-theoretic proof that ˇ2—S 2– ˇ Z . Also, since ˇi—S 1– … 0 for i> 1 by Proposition 4.1, the exact sequence implies that there are isomorphisms ˇi—S 3– ˇ ˇi—S 2– for all i \u0015 3 , so in particular ˇ3—S 2– ˇ ˇ3—S 3– , and by Corollary 4.25 the latter group is Z . After these preliminary remarks, let us begin by deﬁning the property that leads to a long exact sequence of homotopy groups. A map p : E!B is said to have the homotopy lifting property with respect to a space X if, given a homotopy gt : X!B and a map eg0 : X!E lifting g0 ,so p eg0 … g0 , then there exists a homotopy egt : X!E lifting gt . From a formal point of view, this can be regarded as a special case of the lift extension property for a pair —Z; A– , which asserts that every map Z!B has a lift Z!E extending a given lift deﬁned on the subspace A ˆ Z . The case —Z; A– … —X \u0002 I; X \u0002f0g– is the homotopy lifting property. A ﬁbration is a map p : E!B having the homotopy lifting property with respect to all spaces X . For example, a projection B \u0002 F!B is a ﬁbration since we can choose lifts of the form egt—x– … —gt—x–; h—x–– where eg0—x– … —g0—x–; h—x–– . 376 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Theorem 4.41. Suppose p : E!B has the homotopy lifting property with respect to disks Dk for all k \u0015 0 . Choose basepoints b0 2 B and x0 2 F … p−1—b0– . Then the map p\u0003 : ˇn—E;F ;x0–!ˇn—B; b0– is an isomorphism for all n \u0015 1 . Hence if B is path-connected, there is a long exact sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 !ˇn—F ; x0–!ˇn—E; x0– p\u0003-----! ˇn—B; b0–!ˇn−1—F ; x0–! \u0001\u0001\u0001 !ˇ0—E; x0–!0 The proof will use a relative form of the homotopy lifting property. The map p : E!B is said to have the homotopy lifting property for a pair —X; A– if each ho- motopy ft : X!B lifts to a homotopy egt : X!E starting with a given lift eg0 and extending a given lift egt : A!E . In other words, the homotopy lifting property for —X; A– is the lift extension property for —X \u0002 I; X \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I– . The homotopy lifting property for Dk is equivalent to the homotopy lifting prop- erty for —Dk;@Dk– since the pairs —Dk \u0002 I; Dk \u0002f0g– and —Dk \u0002 I; Dk \u0002f0g[@Dk \u0002 I– are homeomorphic. This implies that the homotopy lifting property for disks is equiva- lent to the homotopy lifting property for all CW pairs —X; A– . For by induction over the skeleta of X it sufﬁces to construct a lifting egt one cell of X − A at a time. Com- posing with the characteristic map Ø : Dk!X of a cell then gives a reduction to the case —X; A– … —Dk;@Dk– . A map p : E!B satisfying the homotopy lifting property for disks is sometimes called a Serre ﬁbration. Proof: First we show that p\u0003 is onto. Represent an element of ˇn—B; b0– by a map f : —In;@In–!—B; b0– . The constant map to x0 provides a lift of f to E over the sub- space Jn−1 ˆ In , so the relative homotopy lifting property for —In−1;@In−1– extends this to a lift ef : In!E , and this lift satisﬁes ef—@In– ˆ F since f—@In– … b0 . Then ef represents an element of ˇn—E;F ;x0– with p\u0003—ƒ ef⁄– … ƒf ⁄ since p ef … f . Injectivity of p\u0003 is similar. Given ef0; ef1 : —In;@In;Jn−1–!—E;F ;x0– such that p\u0003—ƒ ef0⁄– … p\u0003—ƒ ef1⁄– , let G : —In \u0002 I; @In \u0002 I–!—B; b0– be a homotopy from p ef0 to p ef1 . We have a partial lift eG given by ef0 on In \u0002f0g , ef1 on In \u0002f1g , and the constant map to x0 on Jn−1 \u0002 I . After permuting the last two coordinates of In \u0002 I , the relative ho- motopy lifting property gives an extension of this partial lift to a full lift eG : In \u0002 I!E . This is a homotopy eft : —In;@In;Jn−1–!—E;F ;x0– from ef0 to ef1 .So p\u0003 is injective. For the last statement of the theorem we plug ˇn—B; b0– in for ˇn—E;F ;x0– in the long exact sequence for the pair —E; F – . The map ˇn—E; x0–!ˇn—E;F ;x0– in the ex- act sequence then becomes the composition ˇn—E; x0–!ˇn—E;F ;x0– p\u0003-----! ˇn—B; b0– , which is just p\u0003 : ˇn—E; x0–!ˇn—B; b0– . The 0 at the end of the sequence, surjectivity of ˇ0—F ; x0–!ˇ0—E; x0– , comes from the hypothesis that B is path-connected since a path in E from an arbitrary point x 2 E to F can be obtained by lifting a path in B from p—x– to b0 . tu A ﬁber bundle structure on a space E , with ﬁber F , consists of a projection map p : E!B such that each point of B has a neighborhood U for which there is a Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 377 homeomorphism h : p−1—U–!U \u0002 F making the diagram at ¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!U U UF()p h p £ - 1 the right commute, where the unlabeled map is projection onto the ﬁrst factor. Commutativity of the diagram means that h carries each ﬁber Fb … p−1—b– homeomorphically onto the copy fbg\u0002 F of F . Thus the ﬁbers Fb are arranged locally as in the product B \u0002 F , though not necessarily globally. An h as above is called a local trivialization of the bundle. Since the ﬁrst coordinate of h is just p , h is determined by its second coordinate, a map p−1—U–!F which is a homeomorphism on each ﬁber Fb . The ﬁber bundle structure is determined by the projection map p : E!B , but to indicate what the ﬁber is we sometimes write a ﬁber bundle as F!E!B , a ‘short exact sequence of spaces.’ The space B is called the base space of the bundle, and E is the total space. Example 4.42. A ﬁber bundle with ﬁber a discrete space is a covering space. Con- versely, a covering space whose ﬁbers all have the same cardinality, for example a covering space over a connected base space, is a ﬁber bundle with discrete ﬁber. Example 4.43. One of the simplest nontrivial ﬁber bundles is the M¨obius band, which is a bundle over S 1 with ﬁber an interval. Speciﬁcally, take E to be the quotient of I \u0002 ƒ−1; 1⁄ under the identiﬁcations —0;v– ˘ —1; −v– , with p : E!S 1 induced by the projection I \u0002 ƒ−1; 1⁄!I , so the ﬁber is ƒ−1; 1⁄ . Glueing two copies of E together by the identity map between their boundary circles produces a Klein bottle, a bundle over S 1 with ﬁber S 1 . Example 4.44. Projective spaces yield interesting ﬁber bundles. In the real case we have the familiar covering spaces S n!RPn with ﬁber S 0 . Over the complex num- bers the analog of this is a ﬁber bundle S 1!S 2n‡1!CPn . Here S 2n‡1 is the unit sphere in Cn‡1 and CPn is viewed as the quotient space of S 2n‡1 under the equiv- alence relation —z0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn– ˘ \u0015—z0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn– for \u0015 2 S 1 , the unit circle in C . The projection p : S 2n‡1!CPn sends —z0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn– to its equivalence class ƒz0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn⁄ , so the ﬁbers are copies of S 1 . To see that the local triviality condition for ﬁber bun- dles is satisﬁed, let Ui ˆ CPn be the open set of equivalence classes ƒz0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn⁄ with zi ﬂ 0 . Deﬁne hi : p−1—Ui–!Ui \u0002 S 1 by hi—z0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn– … —ƒz0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn⁄; zi=jzij– . This takes ﬁbers to ﬁbers, and is a homeomorphism since its inverse is the map —ƒz0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn⁄; \u0015– , \u0015jzijz−1 i —z0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn– , as one checks by calculation. The construction of the bundle S 1!S 2n‡1!CPn also works when n …1 ,so there is a ﬁber bundle S 1!S 1!CP1 . Example 4.45. The case n … 1 is particularly interesting since CP1 … S 2 and the bundle becomes S 1!S 3!S 2 with ﬁber, total space, and base all spheres. This is known as the Hopf bundle, and is of low enough dimension to be seen explicitly. The projection S 3!S 2 can be taken to be —z0;z1– , z0=z1 2 C [ f1g … S 2 . In polar coordinates we have p—r0ei\u00120 ;r1ei\u00121 – … —r0=r1–ei—\u00120−\u00121– where r 2 0 ‡ r 2 1 … 1 . For a 378 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory ﬁxed ratio ˆ … r0=r1 2 —0; 1– the angles \u00120 and \u00121 vary independently over S 1 ,so the points —r0ei\u00120 ;r1ei\u00121 – form a torus Tˆ ˆ S 3 . Letting ˆ vary, these disjoint tori Tˆ ﬁll up S 3 , if we include the limiting cases T0 and T1 where the radii r0 and r1 are zero, making the tori T0 and T1 degenerate to circles. These two circles are the unit circles in the two C factors of C 2 , so under stereographic projection of S 3 from the point —0; 1– onto R3 they correspond to the unit circle in the xy plane and the z axis. The concentric tori Tˆ are then arranged as in the following ﬁgure. Each torus Tˆ is a union of circle ﬁbers, the pairs —\u00120;\u00121– with \u00120 − \u00121 constant. These ﬁber circles have slope 1 on the torus, winding around once longitudinally and once meridionally. With respect to the ambient space it might be more accurate to say they have slope ˆ .As ˆ goes to 0 or 1 the ﬁber circles approach the circles T0 and T1 , which are also ﬁbers. The ﬁgure shows four of the tori decomposed into ﬁbers. Example 4.46. Replacing the ﬁeld C by the quaternions H , the same constructions yield ﬁber bundles S 3!S 4n‡3!HPn over quaternionic projective spaces HPn . Here the ﬁber S 3 is the unit quaternions, and S 4n‡3 is the unit sphere in H n‡1 . Taking n … 1 gives a second Hopf bundle S 3!S 7!S 4 … HP1 . Example 4.47. Another Hopf bundle S 7!S 15!S 8 can be deﬁned using the octonion algebra O . Elements of O are pairs of quaternions —a1;a2– with multiplication given by —a1;a2–—b1;b2– … —a1b1 − b2a2;a2b1 ‡ b2a1– . Regarding S 15 as the unit sphere in the 16 dimensional vector space O 2 , the projection map p : S 15!S 8 … O [ f1g is —z0;z1–, z0z−1 1 , just as for the other Hopf bundles, but because O is not associative, a little care is needed to show this is a ﬁber bundle with ﬁber S 7 , the unit octonions. Let U0 and U1 be the complements of 1 and 0 in the base space O [ f1g . Deﬁne hi : p−1—Ui–!Ui \u0002 S 7 and gi : Ui \u0002 S 7!p−1—Ui– by h0—z0;z1– … —z0z−1 1 ;z1=jz1j–; g0—z; w– … —zw; w–=j—zw; w–j h1—z0;z1– … —z0z−1 1 ;z0=jz0j–; g1—z; w– … —w; z−1w–=j—w; z−1w–j Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 379 If one assumes the known fact that any subalgebra of O generated by two elements is associative, then it is a simple matter to check that gi and hi are inverse home- omorphisms, so we have a ﬁber bundle S 7!S 15!S 8 . Actually, the calculation that gi and hi are inverses needs only the following more elementary facts about octo- nions z; w , where the conjugate z of z … —a1;a2– is deﬁned by the expected formula z … —a1; −a2– : (1) rz … zr for all r 2 R and z 2 O , where R ˆ O as the pairs —r ; 0– . (2) jzj2 … zz … zz , hence z−1 … z=jzj 2 . (3) jzwj…jzjjwj . (4) zw … w z , hence —zw–−1 … w −1z−1 . (5) z—zw– … —zz–w and —zw–w … z—ww– , hence z—z−1w– … w and —zw–w −1 … z . These facts can be checked by somewhat tedious direct calculation. More elegant derivations can be found in Chapter 8 of [Ebbinghaus 1991]. There is an octonion projective plane OP2 obtained by attaching a cell e16 to S 8 via the Hopf map S 15!S 8 , just as CP2 and HP2 are obtained from the other Hopf maps. However, there is no octonion analog of RPn , CPn , and HPn for n> 2 since associativity of multiplication is needed for the relation —z0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn– ˘ \u0015—z0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn– to be an equivalence relation. There are no ﬁber bundles with ﬁber, total space, and base space spheres of other dimensions than in these Hopf bundle examples. This is discussed in an exercise for x4.D, which reduces the question to the famous ‘Hopf invariant one’ problem. Proposition 4.48. A ﬁber bundle p : E!B has the homotopy lifting property with respect to all CW pairs —X; A– . A theorem of Huebsch and Hurewicz proved in x2.7 of [Spanier 1966] says that ﬁber bundles over paracompact base spaces are ﬁbrations, having the homotopy lift- ing property with respect to all spaces. This stronger result is not often needed in algebraic topology, however. Proof: As noted earlier, the homotopy lifting property for CW pairs is equivalent to the homotopy lifting property for disks, or equivalently, cubes. Let G : In \u0002 I!B , G—x; t– … gt—x– , be a homotopy we wish to lift, starting with a given lift eg0 of g0 . Choose an open cover fU\u000bg of B with local trivializations h\u000b : p−1—U\u000b–!U\u000b \u0002 F . Us- ing compactness of In \u0002 I , we may subdivide In into small cubes C and I into intervals Ij … ƒtj;tj‡1⁄ so that each product C \u0002 Ij is mapped by G into a single U\u000b . We may assume by induction on n that egt has already been constructed over @C for each of the subcubes C . To extend this egt over a cube C we may proceed in stages, construct- ing egt for t in each successive interval Ij . This in effect reduces us to the case that no subdivision of In \u0002 I is necessary, so G maps all of In \u0002 I to a single U\u000b . Then we have eG—In \u0002f0g[ @In \u0002 I– ˆ p−1—U\u000b– , and composing eG with the local trivialization 380 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory h\u000b reduces us to the case of a product bundle U\u000b \u0002 F . In this case the ﬁrst coordinate of a lift egt is just the given gt , so only the second coordinate needs to be constructed. This can be obtained as a composition In \u0002 I!In \u0002f0g[ @In \u0002 I!F where the ﬁrst map is a retraction and the second map is what we are given. tu Example 4.49. Applying this theorem to a covering space p : E!B with E and B path-connected, and discrete ﬁber F , the resulting long exact sequence of homotopy groups yields Proposition 4.1 that p\u0003 : ˇn—E–!ˇn—B– is an isomorphism for n \u0015 2. We also obtain a short exact sequence 0!ˇ1—E–!ˇ1—B–!ˇ0—F –!0 , consistent with the covering space theory facts that p\u0003 : ˇ1—E–!ˇ1—B– is injective and that the ﬁber F can be identiﬁed, via path-lifting, with the set of cosets of p\u0003ˇ1—E– in ˇ1—B– . Example 4.50. From the bundle S 1!S 1!CP1 we obtain ˇi—CP1– ˇ ˇi−1—S 1– for all i since S 1 is contractible. Thus CP1 is a K—Z; 2– . In similar fashion the bundle S 3!S 1!HP1 gives ˇi—HP1– ˇ ˇi−1—S 3– for all i , but these homotopy groups are far more complicated than for CP1 and S 1 . In particular, HP1 is not a K—Z; 3– . Example 4.51. The long exact sequence for the Hopf bundle S 1!S 3!S 2 gives iso- morphisms ˇ2—S 2– ˇ ˇ1—S 1– and ˇn—S 3– ˇ ˇn—S 2– for all n \u0015 3 . Taking n … 3, we see that ˇ3—S 2– is inﬁnite cyclic, generated by the Hopf map S 3!S 2 . From this example and the preceding one we see that S 2 and S 3 \u0002 CP1 are simply- connected CW complexes with isomorphic homotopy groups, though they are not homotopy equivalent since they have quite different homology groups. Example 4.52: Whitehead Products. Let us compute ˇ3—W \u000b S 2 \u000b– , showing that it is free abelian with basis consisting of the Hopf maps S 3!S 2 \u000b ˆ W \u000b S 2 \u000b together with the attaching maps S 3!S 2 \u000b _ S 2 \f ˆ W \u000b S 2 \u000b of the cells e2 \u000b \u0002 e2 \f in the products S 2 \u000b \u0002 S 2 \f for all unordered pairs \u000b ﬂ \f . Suppose ﬁrst that there are only ﬁnitely many summands S 2 \u000b . For a ﬁnite prod- uct Q \u000b X\u000b of path-connected spaces, the map ˇn—W \u000b X\u000b–!ˇn—Q \u000b X\u000b– induced by inclusion is surjective since the group ˇn—Q \u000b X\u000b– ˇ L \u000b ˇn—X\u000b– is generated by the subgroups ˇn—X\u000b– . Thus the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair —Q \u000b X\u000b; W \u000b X\u000b– breaks up into short exact sequences 0 -! ˇn‡1—Q \u000b X\u000b; W \u000b X\u000b– -! ˇn—W \u000b X\u000b– -! ˇn—Q \u000b X\u000b– -! 0 These short exact sequences split since the inclusions X\u000b > W \u000b X\u000b induce maps ˇn—X\u000b–!ˇn—W \u000b X\u000b– and hence a splitting homomorphism L \u000b ˇn—X\u000b–!ˇn—W \u000b X\u000b– . Taking X\u000b … S 2 \u000b and n … 3 , we get an isomorphism ˇ3—W \u000b S 2 \u000b– ˇ ˇ4—Q \u000b S 2 \u000b; W \u000b S 2 \u000b– \b (L \u000b ˇ3—S 2 \u000b–\u0001 The factor L \u000b ˇ3—S 2 \u000b– is free with basis the Hopf maps S 3!S 2 \u000b by the preceding ex- ample. For the other factor we have ˇ4—Q \u000b S 2 \u000b; W \u000b S 2 \u000b– ˇ ˇ4—Q \u000b S 2 \u000b= W \u000b S 2 \u000b– by Proposi- tion 4.28. The quotient Q \u000b S 2 \u000b= W \u000b S 2 \u000b has 5 skeleton a wedge of spheres S 4 \u000b\f for \u000b ﬂ \f , Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 381 so ˇ4—Q \u000b S 2 \u000b= W \u000b S 2 \u000b– ˇ ˇ4—W \u000b\f S 4 \u000b\f– is free with basis the inclusions S 4 \u000b\f > W \u000b\f S 4 \u000b\f . Hence ˇ4—Q \u000b S 2 \u000b; W \u000b S 2 \u000b– is free with basis the characteristic maps of the 4 cells e2 \u000b \u0002 e2 \f . Via the injection @ : ˇ4—Q \u000b S 2 \u000b; W \u000b S 2 \u000b–!ˇ3—W \u000b S 2 \u000b– this means that the attaching maps of the cells e2 \u000b \u0002 e2 \f form a basis for the summand Im @ of ˇ3—W \u000b S 2 \u000b– . This ﬁnishes the proof for the case of ﬁnitely many summands S 2 \u000b . The case of inﬁnitely many S 2 \u000b ’s follows immediately since any map S 3! W \u000b S 2 \u000b has compact image, lying in a ﬁnite union of summands, and similarly for any homotopy between such maps. The maps S 3!S 2 \u000b _ S 2 \f in this example are expressible in terms of a product in homotopy groups called the Whitehead product, deﬁned as follows. Given basepoint- preserving maps f : S k!X and g : S `!X , let ƒf ; g⁄ : S k‡`−1!X be the composition S k‡`−1 -! S k _ S ` f _g ------------! X where the ﬁrst map is the attaching map of the —k ‡ `– cell of S k \u0002 S ` with its usual CW structure. Since homotopies of f or g give rise to ho- motopies of ƒf ; g⁄ , we have a well-deﬁned product ˇk—X–\u0002 ˇ`—X–!ˇk‡`−1—X– . The notation ƒf ; g⁄ is used since for k … ` … 1 this is just the commutator product in ˇ1—X– . It is an exercise to show that when k … 1 and `> 1, ƒf ; g⁄ is the difference between g and its image under the ˇ1 action of f . In these terms the map S 3!S 2 \u000b _ S 2 \f in the preceding example is the Whitehead product ƒi\u000b;i\f⁄ of the two inclusions of S 2 into S 2 \u000b _ S 2 \f . Another example of a Whitehead product we have encountered previously is ƒ11; 11⁄ : S 2n−1!S n , which is the attaching map of the 2n cell of the space J—S n– considered in x3.2. The calculation of ˇ3—W \u000b S 2 \u000b– is the ﬁrst nontrivial case of a more general theo- rem of Hilton calculating all the homotopy groups of any wedge sum of spheres in terms of homotopy groups of spheres, using Whitehead products. A further general- ization by Milnor extends this to wedge sums of suspensions of arbitrary connected CW complexes. See [Whitehead 1978] for an exposition of these results and further information on Whitehead products. Example 4.53: Stiefel and Grassmann Manifolds. The ﬁber bundles with total space a sphere and base space a projective space considered above are the cases n … 1of families of ﬁber bundles in each of the real, complex, and quaternionic cases: O—n– -!Vn—R k– -! Gn—R k– O—n– -! Vn—R 1– -! Gn—R 1– U—n– -!Vn—C k– -! Gn—C k– U—n– -! Vn—C 1– -! Gn—C 1– Sp—n– -!Vn—H k– -! Gn—H k– Sp—n– -! Vn—H 1– -! Gn—H 1– Taking the real case ﬁrst, the Stiefel manifold Vn—R k– is the space of n frames in R k , that is, n tuples of orthonormal vectors in R k . This is topologized as a subspace of the product of n copies of the unit sphere in R k . The Grassmann manifold Gn—Rk– is the space of n dimensional vector subspaces of R k . There is a natural surjection p : Vn—R k–!Gn—R k– sending an n frame to the subspace it spans, and Gn—R k– is topologized as a quotient space of Vn—R k– via this projection. The ﬁbers of the map 382 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory p are the spaces of n frames in a ﬁxed n plane in R k and so are homeomorphic to Vn—Rn– .An n frame in Rn is the same as an orthogonal n\u0002 n matrix, regarding the columns of the matrix as an n frame, so the ﬁber can also be described as the orthogonal group O—n– . There is no difﬁculty in allowing k …1 in these deﬁnitions, and in fact Vn—R 1– … S k Vn—R k– and Gn—R 1– … S k Gn—R k– . The complex and quaternionic Stiefel manifolds and Grassmann manifolds are deﬁned in the same way using the usual Hermitian inner products in C k and H k . The unitary group U—n– consists of n\u0002 n matrices whose columns form orthonormal bases for Cn , and the symplectic group Sp—n– is the quaternionic analog of this. We should explain why the various projection maps Vn!Gn are ﬁber bundles. Let us take the real case for concreteness, though the argument is the same in all cases. If we ﬁx an n plane P 2 Gn—R k– and choose an orthonormal basis for P , then we ob- tain continuously varying orthonormal bases for all n planes P 0 in a neighborhood U of P by projecting the basis for P orthogonally onto P 0 to obtain a nonorthonor- mal basis for P 0 , then applying the Gram–Schmidt process to this basis to make it orthonormal. The formulas for the Gram–Schmidt process show that it is continuous. Having orthonormal bases for all n planes in U , we can use these to identify these n planes with R n , hence n frames in these n planes are identiﬁed with n frames in Rn , and so p−1—U– is identiﬁed with U \u0002 Vn—R n– . This argument works for k …1 as well as for ﬁnite k . In the case n … 1 the total spaces V1 are spheres, which are highly connected, and the same is true in general: Vn—R k– is —k − n − 1– connected. Vn—C k– is —2k − 2n– connected. Vn—H k– is —4k − 4n ‡ 2– connected. Vn—R 1– , Vn—C 1– , and Vn—H1– are contractible. The ﬁrst three statements will be proved in the next example. For the last statement the argument is the same in the three cases, so let us consider the real case. Deﬁne a homotopy ht : R 1!R 1 by ht—x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– … —1−t–—x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001–‡t—0;x1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . This is linear for each t , and its kernel is easily checked to be trivial. So if we apply ht to an n frame we get an n tuple of independent vectors, which can be made orthonormal by the Gram–Schmidt formulas. Thus we have a deformation retraction, in the weak sense, of Vn—R1– onto the subspace of n frames with ﬁrst coordinate zero. Iterating this n times, we deform into the subspace of n frames with ﬁrst n coordinates zero. For such an n frame —v1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn– deﬁne a homotopy —1−t–—v1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vn–‡t—e1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;en– where ei is the i th standard basis vector in R 1 . This homotopy preserves linear independence, so after again applying Gram–Schmidt we have a deformation through n frames, which ﬁnishes the construction of a contraction of Vn—R 1– . Since Vn—R1– is contractible, we obtain isomorphisms ˇiO—n– ˇ ˇi‡1Gn—R 1– for all i and n , and similarly in the complex and quaternionic cases. Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 383 Example 4.54. For m< n \u0014 k there are ﬁber bundles Vn−m—R k−m– -! Vn—R k– p -----! Vm—R k– where the projection p sends an n frame onto the m frame formed by its ﬁrst m vectors, so the ﬁber consists of —n − m– frames in the —k − m– plane orthogonal to a given m frame. Local trivializations can be constructed as follows. For an m frame F , choose an orthonormal basis for the —k − m– plane orthogonal to F . This determines orthonormal bases for the —k − m– planes orthogonal to all nearby m frames by orthogonal projection and Gram–Schmidt, as in the preceding example. This allows us to identify these —k−m– planes with R k−m , and in particular the ﬁbers near p−1—F – are identiﬁed with Vn−m—Rk−m– , giving a local trivialization. There are analogous bundles in the complex and quaternionic cases as well, with local triviality shown in the same way. Restricting to the case m … 1 , we have bundles Vn−1—R k−1–!Vn—R k–!S k−1 whose associated long exact sequence of homotopy groups allows us deduce that Vn—R k– is —k − n − 1– connected by induction on n . In the complex and quaternionic cases the same argument yields the other connectivity statements in the preceding example. Taking k … n we obtain ﬁber bundles O—k − m–!O—k–!Vm—R k– . The ﬁbers are in fact just the cosets \u000bO—k − m– for \u000b 2 O—k– , where O—k − m– is regarded as the subgroup of O—k– ﬁxing the ﬁrst m standard basis vectors. So we see that Vm—R k– is identiﬁable with the coset space O—k–=O—k − m– , or in other words the orbit space for the free action of O—k − m– on O—k– by right-multiplication. In similar fashion one can see that Gm—Rk– is the coset space O—k–= ( O—m–\u0002 O—k − m– \u0001 where the subgroup O—m–\u0002 O—k − m– ˆ O—k– consists of the orthogonal transformations taking the m plane spanned by the ﬁrst m standard basis vectors to itself. The corresponding observations apply also in the complex and quaternionic cases, with the unitary and symplectic groups. Example 4.55: Bott Periodicity. Specializing the preceding example by taking m … 1 and k … n we obtain bundles O—n − 1– -! O—n– p -----! S n−1 U—n − 1– -! U—n– p -----! S 2n−1 Sp—n − 1– -! Sp—n– p -----! S 4n−1 The map p can be described as evaluation of an orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic transformation on a ﬁxed unit vector. These bundles show that computing homotopy groups of O—n– , U—n– , and Sp—n– should be at least as difﬁcult as computing homo- topy groups of spheres. For example, if one knew the homotopy groups of O—n– and O—n − 1– , then from the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the ﬁrst bundle one could say quite a bit about the homotopy groups of S n−1 . 384 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory The bundles above imply a very interesting stability property. In the real case, the inclusion O—n−1–>O—n– induces an isomorphism on ˇi for i<n−2 , from the long exact sequence of the ﬁrst bundle. Hence the groups ˇiO—n– are independent of n if n is sufﬁciently large, and the same is true for the groups ˇiU—n– and ˇiSp—n– via the other two bundles. One of the most surprising results in all of algebraic topology is the Bott Periodicity Theorem which asserts that these stable groups repeat periodically, with a period of eight for O and Sp and a period of two for U . Their values are given in the following table: i mod 8 012 3 456 7 ˇiO—n– Z2 Z2 0 Z 000 Z ˇiU—n– 0 Z 0 Z 0 Z 0 Z ˇiSp—n– 000 ZZ2 Z2 0 Z Stable Homotopy Groups We showed in Corollary 4.24 that for an n connected CW complex X , the sus- pension map ˇi—X–!ˇi‡1—SX– is an isomorphism for i< 2n ‡ 1 . In particular this holds for i \u0014 n so SX is —n ‡ 1– connected. This implies that in the sequence of iterated suspensions ˇi—X– -! ˇi‡1—SX– -! ˇi‡2—S 2X– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 all maps are eventually isomorphisms, even without any connectivity assumption on X itself. The resulting stable homotopy group is denoted ˇ s i —X– . An especially interesting case is the group ˇ s i —S 0– , which equals ˇi‡n—S n– for n>i ‡ 1 . This stable homotopy group is often abbreviated to ˇ s i and called the stable i stem. It is a theorem of Serre which we prove in [SSAT] that ˇ s i is always ﬁnite for i> 0. These stable homotopy groups of spheres are among the most fundamental ob- jects in topology, and much effort has gone into their calculation. At the present time, complete calculations are known only for i up to around 60 or so. Here is a table for i \u0014 19 , taken from [Toda 1962]: ¼ i i s¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ 00 0 102 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 2ZZ 2Z 24Z ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ 1413 15 16 17 18 19 3Z 2Z 2Z 2Z240Z £ 2Z 2Z£ 8Z 2Z£2Z 2Z£ 2Z 2Z£ 2Z£ 2Z£480Z 2Z£ 264Z 2Z£ 2Z 6Z 504Z2Z£ 2Z£ Patterns in this apparent chaos begin to emerge only when one projects ˇ s i onto its p components, the quotient groups obtained by factoring out all elements of order relatively prime to the prime p . For i> 0 the p component pˇ s i is of course iso- morphic to the subgroup of ˇ s i consisting of elements of order a power of p , but the quotient viewpoint is in some ways preferable. Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 385 The ﬁgure below is a schematic diagram of the 2 components of ˇ s i for i \u0014 60 . A vertical chain of n dots in the i th column represents a Z2n summand of ˇ s i . The bottom dot of such a chain denotes a generator of this summand, and the vertical segments denote multiplication by 2 , so the second dot up is twice a generator, the next dot is four times a generator, and so on. The three generators \u0011 , \u0017 , and ˙ in dimensions 1 , 3 , and 7 are represented by the Hopf bundle maps S 3!S 2 , S 7!S 4 , S 15!S 8 deﬁned in Examples 4.45, 4.46, and 4.47. 1 3 7 11 15 19 23 27 31 35 39 43 47 51 55 59 ´ º ¾ º 2 2¾ ´ ´ 2 3 º 3 ¾ 3 The horizontal and diagonal lines in the diagram provide some information about compositions of maps between spheres. Namely, there are products ˇ s i \u0002 ˇ s j !ˇ s i‡j deﬁned by compositions S i‡j‡k!S j‡k!S k . Proposition 4.56. The composition products ˇ s i \u0002 ˇ s j !ˇ s i‡j induce a graded ring structure on ˇ s \u0003 … L i ˇ s i satisfying the commutativity relation \u000b\f … —−1– ij\f\u000b for \u000b 2 ˇ s i and \f 2 ˇ s j . This will be proved at the end of this subsection. It follows that pˇ s \u0003 , the direct sum of the p components pˇ s i , is also a graded ring satisfying the same commutativity property. In 2ˇ s i many of the compositions with suspensions of the Hopf maps \u0011 and \u0017 are nontrivial, and these nontrivial compositions are indicated in the diagram by segments extending 1 or 3 units to the right, diagonally for \u0011 and horizontally for \u0017 . Thus for example we see the relation \u0011 3 … 4\u0017 in 2ˇ s 3 . Remember that 2ˇ s 3 ˇ Z8 is a quotient of ˇ s 3 ˇ Z24 , where the actual relation is \u0011 3 … 12\u0017 since 2\u0011 … 0 implies 2\u00113 … 0, so \u0011 3 is the unique element of order two in this Z24 . Across the bottom of the diagram there is a repeated pattern of pairs of ‘teeth.’ This pattern continues to inﬁnity, though with the spikes in dimensions 8k − 1 not all of the same height, namely, the spike in dimension 2 m—2n ‡ 1– − 1 has height m ‡ 1. In the upper part of the diagram, however, there is considerably less regularity, and this complexity seems to persist in higher dimensions as well. The next diagram shows the 3 components of ˇ s i for i \u0014 100 , and the increase in regularity is quite noticeable. Here vertical segments denote multiplication by 3 and 386 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory the other solid segments denote composition with elements \u000b1 2 3ˇ s 3 and \f1 2 3ˇ s 10 . The meaning of the dashed lines will be explained below. The most regular part of the diagram is the ‘triadic ruler’ across the bottom. This continues in the same pattern forever, with spikes of height m ‡ 1 in dimension 4k − 1 for 3 m the highest power of 3 dividing 4k . Looking back at the p … 2 diagram, one can see that the vertical segments of the ‘teeth’ form a ‘dyadic ruler.’ ¯ ®1 1 ¯2 2 ¯3 ¯5 ° 2 ¯6 ¯3/ 3¯6/ 2¯6/ ¯2 2 3 7 11 15 19 23 27 31 35 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83 87 91 95 99 103 Even more regularity appears with larger primes, beginning with the case p … 5 shown in the next diagram. Again one has the inﬁnite ruler, this time a ‘pentadic’ ruler, but there is also much regularity in the rest of the diagram. The four dots with question marks below them near the right edge of the diagram are hypothetical: The calculations in [Ravenel 1986] do not decide whether these potential elements of 5ˇ s i for i … 932 , 933 , 970 , and 971 actually exist. 39 79 119 159 199 239 279 319 359 399 439 479 519 559 599 639 679 719 759 799 839 879 919 959 999 ? ? 1 2 3 4 5 5/2 5/3 5/4 10/2 10/3 10/4 15/2 15/3 15/4 20/2 20/3 20/4 2·19 2·9 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 2 10/5 15/5 20/5 2·14 2·4 ° ?? These three diagrams are drawn from tables published in [Kochman 1990] and [Kochman & Mahowald 1995] for p … 2 and [Ravenel 1986] for p … 3; 5. Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 387 For each p there is a similar inﬁnite ‘ p adic ruler,’ corresponding to cyclic sub- groups of order pm‡1 in pˇ s 2j—p−1–−1 for all j , where pm is the highest power of p dividing j . These subgroups are the p components of a certain cyclic subgroup of ˇ s 4k−1 known as Im J , the image of a homomorphism J : ˇ4k−1—O–!ˇ s 4k−1 . There are also Z2 subgroups of ˇ s i for i … 8k; 8k ‡ 1 forming Im J in these dimensions. In the diagram of 2ˇ s \u0003 these are the parts of the teeth connected to the spike in dimension 8k − 1 . The J homomorphism will be studied in some detail in [VBKT]. There are a few other known inﬁnite families in ˇ s \u0003 , notably a family of elements \fn 2 pˇ s 2—p2−1–n−2p for p \u0015 5 and a family γn 2 pˇ s 2—p3−1–n−2p2−2p‡1 for p \u0015 7 . The element \fn appears in the diagram for p … 5 as the element in the upper part of the diagram labeled by the number n . These \fn ’s generate the strips along the upward diagonal, except when n is a multiple of 5 and the strip is generated by \f2\fn−1 rather than \fn . There are also elements \fn for certain fractional values of n . The element γ2 generates the long strip starting in dimension 437 , but γ3 … 0 . The element γ4 in dimension 933 is one of the question marks. The theory behind these families \fn and γn and possible generalizations, as explained in [Ravenel 1986 & 1992], is one of the more esoteric branches of algebraic topology. In ˇ s \u0003 there are many compositions which are zero. One can get some idea of this from the diagrams above, where all sequences of edges break off after a short time. As a special instance of the vanishing of products, the commutativity formula in Proposition 4.56 implies that the square of an odd-dimensional element of odd order is zero. More generally, a theorem of Nishida says that every positive-dimensional element \u000b 2 ˇ s \u0003 is nilpotent, with \u000b n … 0 for some n . For example, for the element \f1 2 5ˇ s 38 the smallest such n is 18 . The widespread vanishing of products in ˇ s \u0003 can be seen as limiting their use- fulness in describing the structure of ˇ s \u0003 . But it can also be used to construct new elements of ˇ s \u0003 . Suppose one has maps W f -----! X g -----! Y h-----! Z such that the com- positions gf and hg are both homotopic to constant maps. A nullhomotopy of gf gives an extension of gf to a map F : CW!Y , and a nullhomotopy of hg gives an extension of hg to a map G : CX!Z . Regarding the suspension SW as the union of two cones CW , deﬁne the Toda bracket hf; g; hi : SW!Z to be the composition G—Cf – on one cone and hF on the other. f g h Cf G F X Y Z W The map hf; g; hi is not uniquely determined by f , g , and h since it depends on the choices of the nullhomotopies. In the case of ˇ s \u0003 , the various choices of hf; g; hi 388 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory range over a coset of a certain subgroup, described in an exercise at the end of the section. There are also higher-order Toda brackets hf1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;fni deﬁned in somewhat sim- ilar fashion. The dashed lines in the diagrams of 3ˇ s \u0003 and 5ˇ s \u0003 join an element x to a bracket element h\u000b1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u000b1;xi . Most of the unlabeled elements above the rulers in all three diagrams are obtained from the labeled elements by compositions and brackets. For example, in 2ˇ s \u0003 the 8 dimensional element is h\u0017; \u0011; \u0017i and the 14 dimensional elements are ˙ 2 and h\u0017; h\u0017; \u0011; \u0017i; 2;\u0011i . Proof of 4.56: Only distributivity and commutativity need to be checked. One dis- tributivity law is easy: Given f; g : S i‡j‡k!S j‡k and h : S j‡k!S k , then h—f ‡ g– … hf ‡ hg since both expressions equal hf and hg on the two hemispheres of S i‡j‡k . The other distributivity law will follow from this one and the commutativity relation. To prove the commutativity relation it will be convenient to express suspension in terms of smash product. The smash product S n ^ S 1 can be regarded as the quo- tient space of S n \u0002 I with S n \u0002 @I [fx0g\u0002 I collapsed to a point. This is the same as the quotient of the suspension S n‡1 of S n obtained by collapsing to a point the suspension of x0 . Collapsing this arc in S n‡1 to a point again yields S n‡1 ,so we obtain in this way a homeomorphism identifying S n ^ S 1 with S n‡1 . Under this iden- tiﬁcation the suspension Sf of a basepoint-preserving map f : S n!S n becomes the smash product f ^ 11: S n ^ S 1!S n ^ S 1 . By iteration, the k fold suspension S kf then corresponds to f ^ 11: S n ^ S k!S n ^ S k . Now we verify the commutativity relation. Let f : S i‡k!S k and g : S j‡k!S k be given. We may assume k is even. Consider the commutative diagram below, where ˙ and ˝ transpose the two factors.¡!¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!S k S k ¾ ¿ ^SS k^ j k+ ¡¡¡¡¡!S g k S k^ ^ g ^ SS j k^ +k¡¡¡¡¡! f^ SS j k^ +i k+ 11 11 11 Thinking of S j‡k and S k as smash prod- ucts of circles, ˙ is the composition of k—j ‡ k– transpositions of adjacent circle factors. Such a transposition has degree −1 since it is realized as a reﬂection of the S 2 … S 1 ^ S 1 involved. Hence ˙ has degree —−1– k—j‡k– , which is ‡1 since k is even. Thus ˙ is homotopic to the identity. Similarly, ˝ is homotopic to the identity. Hence f ^g … —11^g–—f ^11– is homotopic to the composition —g ^11–—f ^11– , which is stably equivalent to the composition gf . Symmetrically, fg is stably homotopic to g ^ f . So it sufﬁces to show f ^ g ' —−1– ijg ^ f . This we do by the commutative diagram at the right, where ˙ and¡!¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! S k S k ¾ ¿ ^SS i k^ +j k+ ¡¡¡¡¡! S fg k S k^ ^ gf^ SS j k^ +i k+ ˝ are again the transpositions of the two factors. As before, ˝ is homotopic to the identity, but now ˙ has degree —−1–—i‡k–—j‡k– , which equals —−1– ij since k is even. The composition —g ^f–˙ is homotopic to —−1–ij—g^f– since additive inverses in homotopy groups are obtained by precomposing with a reﬂection, of degree −1 . Thus from the commutativity of the diagram we obtain the relation f ^ g ' —−1– ijg ^ f . tu Elementary Methods of Calculation Section 4.2 389 Exercises 1.

Let p : S 3!S 2 be the Hopf bundle and let q : T 3!S 3 be the quotient map collaps- ing the complement of a ball in the 3 dimensional torus T 3 … S 1 \u0002 S 1 \u0002 S 1 to a point. Show that pq : T 3!S 2 induces the trivial map on ˇ\u0003 and eH\u0003 , but is not homotopic to a constant map. 35. Show that the ﬁber bundle S 3!S 4n‡3!HPn gives rise to a quotient ﬁber bundle S 2!CP2n‡1!HPn by factoring out the action of S 1 on S 4n‡3 by complex scalar multiplication. 36.

Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 393 The Hurewicz theorem provides a strong link between homotopy groups and ho- mology, and hence also an indirect relation with cohomology. But there is a more di- rect connection with cohomology of a quite different sort. We will show that for every CW complex X there is a natural bijection between Hn—X; G– and the set hX; K—G; n–i of basepoint-preserving homotopy classes of maps from X to a K—G; n– . We will also deﬁne a natural group structure on hX; K—G; n–i that makes the bijection a group iso- morphism. The mere fact that there is any connection at all between cohomology and homotopy classes of maps is the ﬁrst surprise here, and the second is that Eilenberg– MacLane spaces are involved, since their deﬁnition is entirely in terms of homotopy groups, which on the face of it have nothing to do with cohomology. After proving this basic isomorphism Hn—X; G– ˇhX; K—G; n–i and describing a few of its immediate applications, the later parts of this section aim toward a further study of Postnikov towers, which were introduced brieﬂy in x4.1. These provide a general theoretical method for realizing an arbitrary CW complex as a sort of twisted product of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces, up to homotopy equivalence. The most ge- ometric interpretation of the phrase ‘twisted product’ is the notion of ﬁber bundle introduced in the previous section, but here we need the more homotopy-theoretic notion of a ﬁbration, so before we begin the discussion of Postnikov towers we ﬁrst take a few pages to present some basic constructions and results about ﬁbrations. As we shall see, Postnikov towers can be expressed as sequences of ﬁbrations with ﬁbers Eilenberg–MacLane spaces, so we can again expect close connections with cohomology. One such connection is provided by k invariants, which describe, at least in principle, how Postnikov towers for a broad class of spaces are determined by a sequence of cohomology classes. Another application of these ideas, described at the end of the section, is a technique for factoring basic extension and lifting prob- lems in homotopy theory into a sequence of smaller problems whose solutions are equivalent to the vanishing of certain cohomology classes. This technique goes under the somewhat grandiose title of Obstruction Theory, though it is really quite a simple idea when expressed in terms of Postnikov towers. The Homotopy Construction of Cohomology The main result of this subsection is the following fundamental relationship be- tween singular cohomology and Eilenberg–MacLane spaces: Theorem 4.57. There are natural bijections T : hX; K—G; n–i!Hn—X; G– for all CW complexes X and all n> 0 , with G any abelian group. Such a T has the form T —ƒf ⁄– … f \u0003—\u000b– for a certain distinguished class \u000b 2 Hn—K—G; n–; G– . 394 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory In the course of the proof we will deﬁne a natural group structure on hX; K—G; n–i such that the transformation T is an isomorphism. A class \u000b 2 Hn—K—G; n–; G– with the property stated in the theorem is called a fundamental class. The proof of the theorem will yield an explicit fundamental class, namely the element of Hn—K—G; n–; G– ˇ Hom—Hn—K; Z–; G– given by the inverse of the Hurewicz isomorphism G … ˇn—K—G; n––!Hn—K; Z– . Concretely, if we choose K—G; n– to be a CW complex with —n − 1– skeleton a point, then a fundamental class is represented by the cellular cochain assigning to each n cell of K—G; n– the element of ˇn—K—G; n–– deﬁned by a characteristic map for the n cell. For connected CW complexes X the theorem also holds with hX; K—G; n–i re- placed by ƒX; K—G; n–⁄ , the nonbasepointed homotopy classes. This is easy to see when n> 1 since every map X!K—G; n– can be homotoped to take basepoint to basepoint, and every homotopy between basepoint-preserving maps can be homo- toped to be basepoint-preserving if the target space K—G; n– is simply-connected. When n … 1 the equality ƒX; K—G; n–⁄ …hX; K—G; n–i is an exercise for x4.A, using the assumption that G is abelian. It is possible to give a direct, bare-hands proof of the theorem, constructing maps and homotopies cell by cell. This provides much geometric insight into why the result is true, but unfortunately the technical details of this proof are rather tedious. So we shall take a different approach, one that has the advantage of placing the result in its natural context via general machinery that turns out to be quite useful in other situations as well. The two main steps will be the following assertions. (1) The functors h n—X– …hX; K—G; n–i deﬁne a reduced cohomology theory on the category of basepointed CW complexes. (2) If a reduced cohomology theory h \u0003 deﬁned on CW complexes has coefﬁcient groups hn—S 0– which are zero for n ﬂ 0 , then there are natural isomorphisms hn—X– ˇ eHn—X; h 0—S 0–– for all CW complexes X and all n . Towards proving (1) we will study a more general question: When does a sequence of spaces Kn deﬁne a cohomology theory by setting h n—X– …hX; Kni ? Note that this will be a reduced cohomology theory since hX; Kni is trivial when X is a point. The ﬁrst question to address is putting a group structure on the set hX; Ki . This requires that either X or K have some special structure. When X … S n we have hS n;Ki… ˇn—K– , which has a group structure when n> 0 . The deﬁnition of this group structure works more generally whenever S n is replaced by a suspension SX , with the sum of maps f; g : SX!K deﬁned as the composition SX!SX _ SX!K where the ﬁrst map collapses an ‘equatorial’ X ˆ SX to a point and the second map consists of f and g on the two summands. However, for this to make sense we must be talking about basepoint-preserving maps, and there is a problem with where to choose the basepoint in SX .If x0 is a basepoint of X , the basepoint of SX should be somewhere along the segment fx0g\u0002 I ˆ SX , most likely either an endpoint or the Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 395 midpoint, but no single choice of such a basepoint gives a well-deﬁned sum. The sum would be well-deﬁned if we restricted attention to maps sending the whole segment fx0g\u0002 I to the basepoint. This is equivalent to considering basepoint-preserving maps ÖX!K where ÖX … SX=—fx0g\u0002 I– and the image of fx0g\u0002 I in ÖX is taken to be the basepoint. If X is a CW complex with x0 a0 cell, the quotient map SX!ÖX is a homotopy equivalence since it collapses a contractible subcomplex of SX to a point, so we can identify hSX; Ki with hÖX; Ki . The space ÖX is called the reduced suspension of X when we want to distinguish it from the ordinary suspension SX . It is easy to check that hÖX; Ki is a group with respect to the sum deﬁned above, inverses being obtained by reﬂecting the I coordinate in the suspension. However, what we would really like to have is a group structure on hX; Ki arising from a special structure on K rather than on X . This can be obtained using the following basic adjoint relation: hÖX; Ki…hX; ÚKi where ÚK is the space of loops in K at its chosen basepoint and the constant loop is taken as the basepoint of ÚK . The space ÚK , called the loopspace of K , is topologized as a subspace of the space KI of all maps I!K , where KI is given the compact-open topology; see the Appendix for the deﬁnition and basic properties of this topology. The adjoint relation hÖX; Ki… hX; ÚKi holds because basepoint-preserving maps ÖX!K are exactly the same as basepoint-preserving maps X!ÚK , the correspondence being given by associating to f : ÖX!K the family of loops obtained by restricting f to the images of the segments fxg\u0002 I in ÖX . Taking X … S n in the adjoint relation, we see that ˇn‡1—K– … ˇn—ÚK– for all n \u0015 0 . Thus passing from a space to its loopspace has the effect of shifting homotopy groups down a dimension. In particular we see that ÚK—G; n– is a K—G; n − 1– . This fact will turn out to be important in what follows. Note that the association X , ÚX is a functor: A basepoint-preserving map f : X!Y induces a map Úf : ÚX!ÚY by composition with f . A homotopy f ' g induces a homotopy Úf ' Úg , so it follows formally that X ' Y implies ÚX ' ÚY . It is a theorem of [Milnor 1959] that the loopspace of a CW complex has the homotopy type of a CW complex. This may be a bit surprising since loopspaces are usually quite large spaces, though of course CW complexes can be quite large too, in terms of the number of cells. What often happens in practice is that if a CW complex X has only ﬁnitely many cells in each dimension, then ÚX is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex with the same property. We will see explicitly how this happens for X … S n in x4.J. Composition of loops deﬁnes a map ÚK \u0002 ÚK!ÚK , and this gives a sum oper- ation in hX; ÚKi by setting —f ‡ g–—x– … f—x– g—x– , the composition of the loops f—x– and g—x– . Under the adjoint relation this is the same as the sum in hÖX; Ki deﬁned previously. If we take the composition of loops as the sum operation then it 396 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory is perhaps somewhat easier to see that hX; ÚKi is a group since the same reasoning which shows that ˇ1—K– is a group can be applied. Since cohomology groups are abelian, we would like the group hX; ÚKi to be abelian. This can be achieved by iterating the operation of forming loopspaces. One has a double loopspace Ú 2K … Ú—ÚK– and inductively an n fold loopspace Ú nK … Ú—Ún−1K– . The evident bijection KY \u0002 Z ˇ —KY – Z is a homeomorphism for locally compact Hausdorff spaces Y and Z , as shown in Proposition A.16 in the Appendix, and from this it follows by induction that ÚnK can be regarded as the space of maps In!K sending @In to the basepoint. Taking n … 2 , we see that the argument that ˇ2—K– is abelian shows more generally that hX; Ú 2Ki is an abelian group. Iterating the adjoint relation gives hÖnX; Ki…hX; Ú nKi , so this is an abelian group for all n \u0015 2. Thus for a sequence of spaces Kn to deﬁne a cohomology theory h n—X– …hX; Kni we have been led to the assumption that each Kn should be a loopspace and in fact a double loopspace. Actually we do not need Kn to be literally a loopspace since it would sufﬁce for it to be homotopy equivalent to a loopspace, as hX; Kni depends only on the homotopy type of Kn . In fact it would sufﬁce to have just a weak homo- topy equivalence Kn!ÚLn for some space Ln since this would induce a bijection hX; Kni…hX; ÚLni by Proposition 4.22. In the special case that Kn … K—G; n– for all n , we can take Ln … Kn‡1 … K—G; n ‡ 1– by the earlier observation that ÚK—G; n ‡ 1– is a K—G; n– . Thus if we take the K—G; n– ’s to be CW complexes, the map Kn!ÚKn‡1 is just a CW approximation K—G; n–!ÚK—G; n ‡ 1– . There is another reason to look for weak homotopy equivalences Kn!ÚKn‡1 . For a reduced cohomology theory hn—X– there are natural isomorphisms h n—X– ˇ hn‡1—ÖX– coming from the long exact sequence of the pair —CX; X– with CX the cone on X ,so if h n—X– …hX; Kni for all n then the isomorphism h n—X– ˇ h n‡1—ÖX– translates into a bijection hX; KniˇhÖX; Kn‡1i…hX; ÚKn‡1i and the most natural thing would be for this to come from a weak equivalence Kn!ÚKn‡1 . Weak equiva- lences of this form would give also weak equivalences Kn!ÚKn‡1!Ú 2Kn‡2 and so we would automatically obtain an abelian group structure on hX; KniˇhX; Ú 2Kn‡2i . These observations lead to the following deﬁnition. An Ω spectrum is a sequence of CW complexes K1;K2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 together with weak homotopy equivalences Kn!ÚKn‡1 for all n . By using the theorem of Milnor mentioned above it would be possible to replace ‘weak homotopy equivalence’ by ‘homotopy equivalence’ in this deﬁnition. However it does not noticeably simplify matters to do this, except perhaps psycho- logically. Notice that if we discard a ﬁnite number of spaces Kn from the beginning of an Ú spectrum K1;K2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 , then these omitted terms can be reconstructed from the remaining Kn ’s since each Kn determines Kn−1 as a CW approximation to ÚKn .So it is not important that the sequence start with K1 . By the same token, this allows us Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 397 to extend the sequence of Kn ’s to all negative values of n . This is signiﬁcant because a general cohomology theory hn—X– need not vanish for negative n . Theorem 4.58. If fKng is an Ú spectrum, then the functors X , hn—X– …hX; Kni , n 2 Z , deﬁne a reduced cohomology theory on the category of basepointed CW com- plexes and basepoint-preserving maps. Rather amazingly, the converse is also true: Every reduced cohomology theory on CW complexes arises from an Ú spectrum in this way. This is the Brown repre- sentability theorem which will be proved in x4.E. A space Kn in an Ú spectrum is sometimes called an inﬁnite loopspace since there are weak homotopy equivalences Kn!Ú kKn‡k for all k . A number of important spaces in algebraic topology turn out to be inﬁnite loopspaces. Besides Eilenberg– MacLane spaces, two other examples are the inﬁnite-dimensional orthogonal and uni- tary groups O and U , for which there are weak homotopy equivalences O!Ú 8O and U!Ú 2U by a strong form of the Bott periodicity theorem, as we will show in [VBKT]. So O and U give periodic Ú spectra, hence periodic cohomology theories known as real and complex K–theory. For a more in-depth introduction to the theory of inﬁnite loopspaces, the book [Adams 1978] can be much recommended. Proof: Two of the three axioms for a cohomology theory, the homotopy axiom and the wedge sum axiom, are quite easy to check. For the homotopy axiom, a basepoint- preserving map f : X!Y induces f \u0003 : hY; Kni!hX; Kni by composition, sending a map Y!Kn to X f -----! Y!Kn . Clearly f \u0003 depends only on the basepoint-preserving homotopy class of f , and it is obvious that f \u0003 is a homomorphism if we replace Kn by ÚKn‡1 and use the composition of loops to deﬁne the group structure. The wedge sum axiom holds since in the realm of basepoint-preserving maps, a map W \u000b X\u000b!Kn is the same as a collection of maps X\u000b!Kn . The bulk of the proof involves associating a long exact sequence to each CW pair —X; A– . As a ﬁrst step we build the following diagram: ACAXX> ASA SXAX> >> >[ CA CXX [[() CA CX CX [[[(( ) CAX [())==== X/¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!'' ' ½ ()1 The ﬁrst row is obtained from the inclusion A > X by iterating the rule, ‘attach a cone on the preceding subspace,’ as shown in the pictures below. A CA X CX The three downward arrows in the diagram (1) are quotient maps collapsing the most recently attached cone to a point. Since cones are contractible, these downward maps 398 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory are homotopy equivalences. The second and third of them have homotopy inverses the evident inclusion maps, indicated by the upward arrows. In the lower row of the diagram the maps are the obvious ones, except for the map X=A!SX which is the composition of a homotopy inverse of the quotient map X [ CA!X=A followed by the maps X [ CA!—X [ CA– [ CX!SA . Thus the square containing this map commutes up to homotopy. It is easy to check that the same is true of the right-hand square as well. The whole construction can now be repeated with SA > SX in place of A > X , then with double suspensions, and so on. The resulting inﬁnite sequence can be written in either of the following two forms: A!X!X [ CA!SA!SX!S—X [ CA–!S 2A!S 2X! \u0001\u0001\u0001 A!X!X=A!SA!SX!SX=SA!S 2A!S 2X! \u0001\u0001\u0001 In the ﬁrst version we use the obvious equality SX [ CSA … S—X [ CA– . The ﬁrst version has the advantage that the map X [CA!SA is easily described and canonical, whereas in the second version the corresponding map X=A!SA is only deﬁned up to homotopy since it depends on choosing a homotopy inverse to the quotient map X [ CA!X=A . The second version does have the advantage of conciseness, however. When basepoints are important it is generally more convenient to use reduced cones and reduced suspensions, obtained from ordinary cones and suspensions by collapsing the segment fx0g\u0002 I where x0 is the basepoint. The image point of this segment in the reduced cone or suspension then serves as a natural basepoint in the quotient. Assuming x0 is a 0 cell, these collapses of fx0g\u0002 I are homotopy equiva- lences. Using reduced cones and suspensions in the preceding construction yields a sequence —2–A > X!X=A!ÖA > ÖX!Ö—X=A–!Ö2A > Ö2X! \u0001\u0001\u0001 where we identify ÖX=ÖA with Ö—X=A– , and all the later maps in the sequence are sus- pensions of the ﬁrst three maps. This sequence, or its unreduced version, is called the coﬁbration sequence or Puppe sequence of the pair —X; A– . It has an evident natu- rality property, namely, a map —X; A–!—Y ; B– induces a map between the coﬁbration sequences of these two pairs, with homotopy-commutative squares: B §BBYY/ BBY/¡¡¡!¡¡¡! §¡¡¡!¡¡¡!§Y¡¡¡! §¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! () 2 ... A §AAXX/ AAX/¡¡¡!¡¡¡! §¡¡¡!¡¡¡!§X¡¡¡! §¡¡¡!¡¡¡! () 2 ... Taking basepoint-preserving homotopy classes of maps from the spaces in (2) to a ﬁxed space K gives a sequence —3– hA; Ki hX; Ki hX=A; Ki hÖA; Ki hÖX; Ki \u0001\u0001\u0001 whose maps are deﬁned by composition with those in (2). For example, the map hX; Ki!hA; Ki sends a map X!K to A!X!K . The sets in (3) are groups starting Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 399 with hÖA; Ki , and abelian groups from hÖ 2A; Ki onward. It is easy to see that the maps between these groups are homomorphisms since the maps in (2) are suspensions from ÖA!ÖX onward. In general the ﬁrst three terms of (3) are only sets with distinguished ‘zero’ elements, the constant maps. A key observation is that the sequence (3) is exact. To see this, note ﬁrst that the diagram (1) shows that, up to homotopy equivalence, each term in (2) is obtained from its two predecessors by the same procedure of forming a mapping cone, so it sufﬁces to show that hA; Ki hX; Ki hX [ CA; Ki is exact. This is easy: A map f : X!K goes to zero in hA; Ki iff its restriction to A is nullhomotopic, ﬁxing the basepoint, and this is equivalent to f extending to a map X [ CA!K . If we have a weak homotopy equivalence K!ÚK0 for some space K0 , then the sequence (3) can be continued three steps to the left via the commutative diagram¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! AX/¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!AX/§() ...AKh , 0i XKh , 0i Kh , 0i §A Kh , 0i¡¡!§X Kh , 0i Kh , 0i¡¡!¡¡!AX/ ...A \u0000Kh , 0i X \u0000Kh , 0i¡¡!\u0000Kh , 0i¡¡!¡¡!AX/ ...A Kh , i¡¡!X Kh , i Kh , i ¼¼ ¼¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¼¼ ¼ Thus if we have a sequence of spaces Kn together with weak homotopy equivalences Kn!ÚKn‡1 , we can extend the sequence (3) to the left indeﬁnitely, producing a long exact sequence —4– \u0001\u0001\u0001 hA; Kni hX; Kni hX=A; Kni hA; Kn−1i hX; Kn−1i \u0001\u0001\u0001 All the terms here are abelian groups and the maps homomorphisms. This long exact sequence is natural with respect to maps —X; A–!—Y ; B– since coﬁbration sequences are natural. tu There is no essential difference between cohomology theories on basepointed CW complexes and cohomology theories on nonbasepointed CW complexes. Given a reduced basepointed cohomology theory eh\u0003 , one gets an unreduced theory by setting hn—X; A– … eh n—X=A– , where X=;… X‡ , the union of X with a disjoint basepoint. This is a nonbasepointed theory since an arbitrary map X!Y induces a basepoint- preserving map X‡!Y‡ . Furthermore, a nonbasepointed unreduced theory h \u0003 gives a nonbasepointed reduced theory by setting ehn—X– … Coker ( h n—point –!h n—X–\u0001 , where the map is induced by the constant map X!point . One could also give an argument using suspension, which is always an isomorphism for reduced theories, and which takes one from the nonbasepointed to the basepointed category. Theorem 4.59. If h\u0003 is an unreduced cohomology theory on the category of CW pairs and h n—point – … 0 for n ﬂ 0 , then there are natural isomorphisms h n—X; A– ˇ Hn( X; A; h 0—point –\u0001 for all CW pairs —X; A– and all n . The corresponding statement for homology theories is also true. 400 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Proof: The case of homology is slightly simpler, so let us consider this ﬁrst. For CW complexes, relative homology groups reduce to absolute groups, so it sufﬁces to deal with the latter. For a CW complex X the long exact sequences of h\u0003 homology groups for the pairs —Xn;Xn−1– give rise to a cellular chain complex \u0001\u0001\u0001 --------! hn‡1—Xn‡1;Xn– dn‡1-----------------! hn—Xn;Xn−1– dn-------------! hn−1—Xn−1;Xn−2– --------! \u0001\u0001\u0001 just as for ordinary homology. The hypothesis that hn—point – … 0 for n ﬂ 0 implies that this chain complex has homology groups hn—X– by the same argument as for ordinary homology. The main thing to verify now is that this cellular chain complex is isomorphic to the cellular chain complex in ordinary homology with coefﬁcients in the group G … h0—point – . Certainly the cellular chain groups in the two cases are isomorphic, being direct sums of copies of G with one copy for each cell, so we have only to check that the cellular boundary maps are the same. It is not really necessary to treat the cellular boundary map d1 from 1 chains to 0 chains since one can always pass from X to ÖX , suspension being a natural isomorphism in any homology theory, and the double suspension Ö 2X has no 1 cells. The calculation of cellular boundary maps dn for n> 1 in terms of degrees of certain maps between spheres works equally well for the homology theory h\u0003 , where ‘degree’ now means degree with respect to the h\u0003 theory, so what is needed is the fact that a map S n!S n of degree m in the usual sense induces multiplication by m on hn—S n– ˇ G . This is obviously true for degrees 0 and 1 , represented by a constant map and the identity map. Since ˇn—S n– ˇ Z , every map S n!S n is homotopic to some multiple of the identity, so the general case will follow if we know that degree in the h\u0003 theory is additive with respect to the sum operation in ˇn—S n– . This is a special case of the following more general assertion: Lemma 4.60. If a functor h from basepointed CW complexes to abelian groups sat- isﬁes the homotopy and wedge axioms, then for any two basepoint-preserving maps f; g : ÖX!K , we have —f ‡ g–\u0003 … f\u0003 ‡ g\u0003 if h is covariant and —f ‡ g– \u0003 … f \u0003 ‡ g\u0003 if h is contravariant. Proof: The map f ‡ g is the composition ÖX c-----! ÖX _ ÖX f _g ------------------! K where c is the quotient map collapsing an equatorial copy of X . In the covariant case consider the diagram at the right, where i1 and i2 §Xh () §Xh () §Xh () Kh ()§X §Xh ( ( ) ) _ _ ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! © © ¤ ¤ ¤ cf g i 1 ¤i 2 ¼ are the inclusions ÖX > ÖX _ ÖX . Let q1;q2 : ÖX _ ÖX -! ÖX be the quotient maps restricting to the identity on the summand indicated by the subscript and collapsing the other summand to a point. Then q1\u0003 \b q2\u0003 is an inverse to i1\u0003 \b i2\u0003 since qjik is the identity map for j … k and the constant map for j ﬂ k . An element x in the left-hand group h—ÖX– in the diagram is sent by the compo- sition —q1\u0003 \b q2\u0003–c\u0003 to the element —x; x– in the lower group h—ÖX–\b h—ÖX– since Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 401 q1c and q2c are homotopic to the identity. The composition —f _g–\u0003—i1\u0003 \bi2\u0003– sends —x; 0– to f\u0003—x– and —0;y– to g\u0003—y– since —f _ g–i1 … f and —f _ g–i2 … g . Hence —x; y– is sent to f\u0003—x– ‡ g\u0003—y– . Combining these facts, we see that the composition across the top of the diagram is x , f\u0003—x– ‡ g\u0003—x– . But this composition is also —f ‡ g–\u0003 since f ‡ g … —f _ g–c . This ﬁnishes the proof in the covariant case. The contravariant case is similar, using the corresponding diagram with arrows reversed. The inverse of i\u0003 1 \b i\u0003 2 is q\u0003 1 \b q\u0003 2 by the same reasoning. An element u in the right-hand group h—K– maps to the element —f \u0003—u–; g\u0003—u–– in the lower group h—ÖX–\b h—ÖX– since —f _ g–i1 … f and —f _ g–i2 … g . An element —x; 0– in the lower group in the diagram maps to the element x in the left-hand group since q1c is homotopic to the identity, and similarly —0;y– maps to y . Hence —x; y– maps to x ‡ y in the left-hand group. We conclude that u 2 h—K– maps by the composition across the top of the diagram to f \u0003—u– ‡ g\u0003—u– in h—ÖX– . But this composition is —f ‡ g–\u0003 by deﬁnition. tu Returning to the proof of the theorem, we see that the cellular chain complexes for h\u0003—X– and H\u0003—X; G– are isomorphic, so we obtain isomorphisms hn—X– ˇ Hn—X; G– for all n . To verify that these isomorphisms are natural with respect to maps f : X!Y we may ﬁrst deform such a map f to be cellular. Then f takes each pair —Xn;Xn−1– to the pair —Y n;Y n−1– , hence f induces a chain map of cellular chain complexes in the h\u0003 theory, as well as for H\u0003—−; G– . To compute these chain maps we may pass to the quotient maps Xn=Xn−1!Y n=Y n−1 . These are maps of the form W \u000b S n \u000b!W \f S n \f , so the induced maps f\u0003 on hn are determined by their component maps f\u0003 : S n \u000b!S n \f . This is exactly the same situation as with the cellular boundary maps before, where we saw that the degree of a map S n!S n determines the induced map on hn .We conclude that the cellular chain map induced by f in the h\u0003 theory agrees exactly with the cellular chain map for H\u0003—−; G– . This implies that the isomorphism between the two theories is natural. The situation for cohomology is quite similar, but there is one point in the ar- gument where a few more words are needed. For cohomology theories the cellular cochain groups are the direct product, rather than the direct sum, of copies of the coefﬁcient group G … h0—point – , with one copy per cell. This means that when there are inﬁnitely many cells in a given dimension, it is not automatically true that the cellular coboundary maps are uniquely determined by how they map factors of one direct product to factors of the other direct product. To be precise, consider the cel- lular coboundary map dn : h n—Xn;Xn−1–!hn‡1—Xn‡1;Xn– . Decomposing the latter group as a product of copies of G for the —n ‡ 1– cells, we see that dn is determined by the maps hn—Xn=Xn−1–!h n—S n \u000b – associated to the attaching maps '\u000b of the cells en‡1 \u000b . The thing to observe is that since '\u000b has compact image, meeting only ﬁnitely many n cells, this map h n—Xn=Xn−1–!h n—S n \u000b – is ﬁnitely supported in the sense that 402 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory there is a splitting of the domain into a product of ﬁnitely many factors and a product of the remaining possibly inﬁnite number of factors, such that the map is zero on the latter product. Finitely supported maps have the good property that they are deter- mined by their restrictions to the G factors of h n—Xn=Xn−1– . From this we deduce, using the lemma, that the cellular coboundary maps in the h \u0003 theory agree with those in ordinary cohomology with G coefﬁcients. This extra argument is also needed to prove naturality of the isomorphisms hn—X– ˇ Hn—X; G– . This completes the proof of Theorem 4.59. tu Proof of Theorem 4.57: The functors h n—X– …hX; K—G; n–i deﬁne a reduced co- homology theory, and the coefﬁcient groups hn—S i– … ˇi—K—G; n–– are the same as eHn—S i; G– , so Theorem 4.59, translated into reduced cohomology, gives natural iso- morphisms T : hX; K—G; n–i! eHn—X; G– for all CW complexes X . It remains to see that T —ƒf ⁄– … f \u0003—\u000b– for some \u000b 2 eHn—K—G; n–; G– , independent of f . This is purely formal: Take \u000b … T—11– for 11 the identity map of K—G; n– , and then naturality gives T —ƒf ⁄– … T—f \u0003—11–– … f \u0003T—11– … f \u0003—\u000b– , where the ﬁrst f \u0003 refers to induced homomorphisms for the functor h n , which means composition with f . tu The fundamental class \u000b … T—11– can be made more explicit if we choose for K—G; n– a CW complex K with —n − 1– skeleton a point. Denoting hX; K—G; n–i by hn—X– , then we have hn—K– ˇ h n—Kn‡1– ˇ Ker d : h n—Kn–!hn‡1—Kn‡1;Kn– The map d is the cellular coboundary in h\u0003 cohomology since we have h n—Kn– … hn—Kn;Kn−1– because Kn−1 is a point and h \u0003 is a reduced theory. The isomorphism of hn—K– with Ker d is given by restriction of maps K!K to Kn , so the element 11 2 h n—K– deﬁning the fundamental class T—11– corresponds, under the isomorphism hn—K– ˇ Ker d , to the inclusion Kn>K viewed as an element of h n—Kn– . As a cellular cocycle this element assigns to each n cell of K the element of the coefﬁcient group G … ˇn—K– given by the inclusion of the closure of this cell into K . This means that the fundamental class \u000b 2 Hn—K; G– is represented by the cellular cocycle assigning to each n cell the element of ˇn—K– given by a characteristic map for the cell. By naturality of T it follows that for a cellular map f : X!K , the corresponding element of Hn—X; G– is represented by the cellular cocycle sending each n cell of X to the element of G … ˇn—K– represented by the composition of f with a characteristic map for the cell. The natural isomorphism Hn—X; G– ˇhX; K—G; n–i leads to a basic principle which reappears many places in algebraic topology, the idea that the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a certain phenomenon is governed by what happens in a single spe- cial case, the universal example. To illustrate, let us prove the following special fact: Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 403 The map H1—X; Z–!H2—X; Z– , \u000b , \u000b 2 , is identically zero for all spaces X . By taking a CW approximation to X we are reduced to the case that X is a CW complex. Then every element of H1—X; Z– has the form f \u0003—\u000b– for some f : X!K—Z; 1– , with \u000b a fundamental class in H1—K—Z; 1–; Z– , further reducing us to verifying the result for this single \u000b , the ‘universal example.’ And for this universal \u000b it is evident that \u000b2 … 0 since S 1 is a K—Z; 1– and H2—S 1; Z– … 0. Does this fact generalize? It certainly does not hold if we replace the coefﬁ- cient ring Z by Z2 since H\u0003—RP1; Z2– … Z2ƒx⁄ . Indeed, the example of RP1 shows more generally that the fundamental class \u000b 2 Hn—K—Z2;n–; Z2– generates a poly- nomial subalgebra Z2ƒ\u000b⁄ ˆ H\u0003—K—Z2;n–; Z2– for each n \u0015 1 , since there is a map f : RP1!K—Z2;n– with f \u0003—\u000b– … xn and all the powers of xn are nonzero, hence also all the powers of \u000b . By the same reasoning, the example of CP1 shows that the fundamental class \u000b 2 H2n—K—Z; 2n–; Z– generates a polynomial subalgebra Zƒ\u000b⁄ in H\u0003—K—Z; 2n–; Z– . As we shall see in [SSAT], H\u0003—K—Z; 2n–; Z–=torsion is exactly this polynomial algebra Zƒ\u000b⁄ . A little more subtle is the question of identifying the subalgebra of H\u0003—K—Z;n–; Z– generated by the fundamental class \u000b for odd n \u0015 3 . By the commutativity prop- erty of cup products we know that \u000b2 is either zero or of order two. To see that \u000b2 is nonzero it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a single space X with an element γ 2 Hn—X; Z– such that γ2 ﬂ 0 . The ﬁrst place to look might be RP1 , but its cohomology with Z coefﬁcients is concentrated in even dimensions. Instead, consider X … RP1 \u0002 RP1 . This has Z2 cohomology Z2ƒx; y⁄ and Example 3E.5 shows that its Z cohomology is the Z2ƒx2;y 2⁄ submodule generated by 1 and x2y ‡ xy 2 , except in dimension zero of course, where 1 generates a Z rather than a Z2 . In particular we can take z … x2k—x2y ‡ xy 2– for any k \u0015 0 , and then all powers zm are nonzero since we are inside the polynomial ring Z2ƒx; y⁄ . It follows that the subalgebra of H\u0003—K—Z;n–; Z– generated by \u000b is Zƒ\u000b⁄=—2\u000b2– for odd n \u0015 3. These examples lead one to wonder just how complicated the cohomology of K—G; n– ’s is. The general construction of a K—G; n– is not very helpful in answering this question. Consider the case G … Z for example. Here one would start with S n and attach —n ‡ 2– cells to kill ˇn‡1—S n– . Since ˇn‡1—S n– happens to be cyclic, only one —n ‡ 2– cell is needed. To continue, one would have to compute generators for ˇn‡2 of the resulting space S n [ en‡2 , use these to attach —n ‡ 3– cells, then compute the resulting ˇn‡3 , and so on for each successive dimension. When n … 2 this procedure happens to work out very neatly, and the resulting K—Z; 2– is CP1 with its usual CW structure having one cell in each even dimension, according to an exercise at the end of the section. However, for larger n it quickly becomes impractical to make this procedure explicit since homotopy groups are so hard to compute. One can get some idea of the difﬁculties of the next case n … 3 by considering the homology groups of K—Z; 3– . Using techniques in [SSAT], the groups Hi—K—Z; 3–; Z– for 0 \u0014 i \u0014 12 can be 404 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory computed to be Z; 0; 0; Z; 0; Z2; 0; Z3; Z2; Z2; Z3; Z10; Z2 To get this sequence of homology groups would require quite a few cells, and the situation only gets worse in higher dimensions, where the homology groups are not always cyclic. Indeed, one might guess that computing the homology groups of K—Z;n– ’s would be of the same order of difﬁculty as computing the homotopy groups of spheres, but by some miracle this is not the case. The calculations are indeed complicated, but they were completely done by Serre and Cartan in the 1950s, not just for K—Z;n– ’s, but for all K—G; n– ’s with G ﬁnitely generated abelian. For example, H\u0003—K—Z; 3–; Z2– is the polynomial algebra Z2ƒx3;x5;x9;x17;x33; \u0001\u0001\u0001⁄ with generators of dimensions 2i ‡ 1 , indicated by the subscripts. And in general, for G ﬁnitely generated abelian, H\u0003—K—G; n–; Zp– is a polynomial algebra on generators of speciﬁed dimensions if p is 2 , while for p an odd prime one gets the tensor product of a polynomial ring on generators of speciﬁed even dimensions and an exterior algebra on generators of speciﬁed odd dimensions. With Z coefﬁcients the description of the cohomology is not nearly so neat, however. We will study these questions in some detail in [SSAT]. There is a good reason for being interested in the cohomology of K—G; n– ’s, aris- ing from the equivalence Hn—X; G– ˇhX; K—G; n–i . Taking Z coefﬁcients for simplic- ity, an element of Hm—K—Z;n–; Z– corresponds to a map \u0012 : K—Z;n–!K—Z;m– .We can compose \u0012 with any map f : X!K—Z;n– to get a map \u0012f : X!K—Z;m– . Letting f vary and keeping \u0012 ﬁxed, this gives a function Hn—X; Z–!Hm—X; Z– , depending only on \u0012 . This is the idea of cohomology operations, which we study in more detail in x4.L. The equivalence Hn—X; G– ˇhX; K—G; n–i also leads to a new viewpoint toward cup products. Taking G to be a ring R and setting Kn … K—R; n– , then if we are given maps f : X!Km and g : Y!Kn , we can deﬁne the cross product of the corresponding cohomology classes by the composition X \u0002 Y f \u0002 g -----------------! Km \u0002 Kn ------! Km ^ Kn \u0016 ------------! Km‡n where the middle map is the quotient map and \u0016 can be deﬁned in the following way. The space Km ^ Kn is —m ‡ n − 1– connected, so by the Hurewicz theorem and the K¨unneth formula for reduced homology we have isomorphisms ˇm‡n—Km ^ Kn– ˇ Hm‡n—Km ^ Kn– ˇ Hm—Km– ⊗ Hn—Kn– ˇ R ⊗ R . By Lemmas 4.7 and 4.31 there is then a map \u0016 : Km ^ Kn!Km‡n inducing the multiplication map R ⊗ R!R on ˇm‡n .Or we could use the isomorphism Hm‡n—Km ^ Kn; R– ˇ Hom—Hm‡n—Km ^ Kn–; R– and let \u0016 be the map corresponding to the cohomology class given by the multiplication homomorphism R ⊗ R!R . Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 405 The case R … Z is particularly simple. We can take Sm as the —m ‡ 1– skeleton of Km , and similarly for Kn ,so Km ^ Kn has S m ^ S n as its —m ‡ n ‡ 1– skeleton and we can obtain \u0016 by extending the inclusion S m ^ S n … S m‡n > Km‡n . It is not hard to prove the basic properties of cup product using this deﬁnition, and in particular the commutativity property becomes somewhat more transparent from this viewpoint. For example, when R … Z , commutativity just comes down to the fact that the map S m ^ S n!S n ^ S m switching the factors has degree —−1– mn when regarded as a map of S m‡n . Fibrations Recall from x4.2 that a ﬁbration is a map p : E!B having the homotopy lifting property with respect to all spaces. In a ﬁber bundle all the ﬁbers are homeomorphic by deﬁnition, but this need not be true for ﬁbrations. An example is the linear projec- tion of a 2 simplex onto one of its edges, which is a ﬁbration according to an exercise at the end of the section. The following result gives some evidence that ﬁbrations should be thought of as a homotopy-theoretic analog of ﬁber bundles: Proposition 4.61. For a ﬁbration p : E!B , the ﬁbers Fb … p−1—b– over each path component of B are all homotopy equivalent. Proof: A path γ : I!B gives rise to a homotopy gt : Fγ—0–!B with gt—Fγ—0–– … γ—t– . The inclusion Fγ—0– > E provides a lift eg0 , so by the homotopy lifting property we have a homotopy egt : Fγ—0–!E with egt—Fγ—0–– ˆ Fγ—t– for all t . In particular, eg1 gives a map Lγ : Fγ—0–!Fγ—1– . The association γ , Lγ has the following basic properties: (a) If γ ' γ0 rel @I , then Lγ ' Lγ0 . In particular the homotopy class of Lγ is inde- pendent of the choice of the lifting egt of gt . (b) For a composition of paths γγ0 , Lγγ0 is homotopic to the composition Lγ0 Lγ . From these statements it follows that Lγ is a homotopy equivalence with homotopy inverse Lγ , where γ is the inverse path of γ . Before proving (a), note that a ﬁbration has the homotopy lifting property for pairs —X \u0002 I; X \u0002 @I– since the pairs —I \u0002 I; I \u0002f0g[@I \u0002 I– and —I \u0002 I; I \u0002f0g– are homeo- morphic, hence the same is true after taking products with X . To prove (a), let γ—s; t– be a homotopy from γ—t– to γ0—t– , —s; t– 2 I \u0002 I . This determines a family gst : Fγ—0–!B with gst—Fγ—0–– … γ—s; t– . Let eg0;t and eg1;t be lifts deﬁning Lγ and Lγ0 , and let egs;0 be the inclusion Fγ—0– > E for all s . Using the homotopy lifting property for the pair —Fγ—0– \u0002 I; Fγ—0– \u0002 @I– , we can extend these lifts to lifts egst for —s; t– 2 I \u0002 I . Restricting to t … 1 then gives a homotopy Lγ ' Lγ0 . Property (b) holds since for lifts egt and eg0 t deﬁning Lγ and Lγ0 we obtain a lift deﬁning Lγγ0 by taking eg2t for 0 \u0014 t \u0014 1=2 and eg0 2t−1Lγ for 1=2 \u0014 t \u0014 1. tu One may ask whether ﬁbrations satisfy a homotopy analog of the local triviality property of ﬁber bundles. Observe ﬁrst that for a ﬁbration p : E!B , the restriction 406 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory p : p−1—A–!A is a ﬁbration for any subspace A ˆ B . So we can ask whether every point of B has a neighborhood U for which the ﬁbration p−1—U–!U is equivalent in some homotopy-theoretic sense to a projection U \u0002 F!U . The natural notion of equivalence for ﬁbrations is deﬁned in the following way. Given ﬁbrations p1 : E1!B and p2 : E2!B , a map f : E1!E2 is called ﬁber-preserving if p1 … p2f , or in other words, f—p−1 1 —b–– ˆ p−1 2 —b– for all b 2 B . A ﬁber-preserving map f : E1!E2 is a ﬁber homotopy equivalence if there is a ﬁber-preserving map g : E2!E1 such that both compositions fg and gf are homotopic to the identity through ﬁber-preserving maps. A ﬁber homotopy equivalence can be thought of as a family of homotopy equivalences between corresponding ﬁbers of E1 and E2 . An interesting fact is that a ﬁber-preserving map that is a homotopy equivalence is a ﬁber homotopy equivalence; this is an exercise for x4.H. We will show that a ﬁbration p : E!B is locally ﬁber-homotopically trivial in the sense described above if B is locally contractible. In order to do this we ﬁrst digress to introduce another basic concept. Given a ﬁbration p : E!B and a map f : A!B , there is a pullback or induced ﬁbration f \u0003—E–!A obtained by setting f \u0003—E– …f—a; e– 2 A\u0002 E jj f —a– … p—e–g , with the projections of f \u0003—E– onto A and E giving a commutative diagram as shown at the right. The homotopy lifting property¡!¡!¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! E AB E() ¤f f p holds for f \u0003—E–!A since a homotopy gt : X!A gives the ﬁrst coordinate of a lift egt : X!f \u0003—E– , the second coordinate being a lifting to E of the composed homotopy fgt . Proposition 4.62. Given a ﬁbration p : E!B and a homotopy ft : A!B , the pull- back ﬁbrations f \u0003 0 —E–!A and f \u0003 1 —E–!A are ﬁber homotopy equivalent. Proof: Let F : A\u0002 I!B be the homotopy ft . The ﬁbration F \u0003—E–!A\u0002 I contains f \u0003 0 —E– and f \u0003 1 —E– over A\u0002f0g and A\u0002f1g . So it sufﬁces to prove the following: For a ﬁbration p : E!B \u0002 I , the restricted ﬁbrations Es … p−1—B \u0002fsg–!B are all ﬁber homotopy equivalent for s 2 ƒ0; 1⁄ . To prove this assertion the idea is to imitate the construction of the homotopy equivalences Lγ in the proof of Proposition 4.61. A path γ : ƒ0; 1⁄!I gives rise to a ﬁber-preserving map Lγ : Eγ—0–!Eγ—1– by lifting the homotopy gt : Eγ—0–!B \u0002 I , gt—x– … —p—x–; γ—t–– , starting with the inclusion Eγ—0– > E . As before, one shows the two basic properties (a) and (b), noting that in (a) the homotopy Lγ ' Lγ0 is ﬁber- preserving since it is obtained by lifting a homotopy ht : Eγ—0– \u0002 ƒ0; 1⁄!B \u0002 I of the form ht—x; u– … —p—x–; −– . From (a) and (b) it follows that Lγ is a ﬁber homotopy equivalence with inverse Lγ . tu Corollary 4.63. A ﬁbration E!B over a contractible base B is ﬁber homotopy equiv- alent to a product ﬁbration B \u0002 F!B . Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 407 Proof: The pullback of E by the identity map B!B is E itself, while the pullback by a constant map B!B is a product B \u0002 F . tu Thus we see that if B is locally contractible then any ﬁbration over B is locally ﬁber homotopy equivalent to a product ﬁbration. Pathspace Constructions There is a simple but extremely useful way to turn arbitrary mappings into ﬁ- brations. Given a map f : A!B , let Ef be the space of pairs —a; γ– where a 2 A and γ : I!B is a path in B with γ—0– … f —a– . We topologize Ef as a subspace of A\u0002 BI , where BI is the space of mappings I!B with the compact-open topology; see the Appendix for the deﬁnition and basic properties of this topology, in particular Proposition A.14 which we will be using shortly. Proposition 4.64. The map p : Ef !B , p—a; γ– … γ—1– , is a ﬁbration. Proof: Continuity of p follows from (a) of Proposition A.14 in the Appendix which says that the evaluation map BI \u0002 I!B , —γ; s– , γ—s– , is continuous. To verify the ﬁbration property, let a homotopy gt : X!B and a lift eg0 : X!Ef of g0 be given. Write eg0—x– … —h—x–; γx– for h : X!A and γx : I!B . Deﬁne a lift egt : X!Ef by egt—x– … —h—x–; γx gƒ0;t⁄—x–– , the second coordinate being the path γx followed by the path traced out by gs—x– for 0 \u0014 s \u0014 t . This composition of paths is deﬁned since g0—x– … p eg0—x– … γx—1– . To check that egt is a continuous homotopy we regard it as a map X \u0002 I!Ef ˆ A\u0002 BI and then apply (b) of Proposition A.14 which in the current context asserts that continuity of a map X \u0002 I!A\u0002 BI is equivalent to continuity of the associated map X \u0002 I \u0002 I!A\u0002 B . tu We can regard A as the subspace of Ef consisting of pairs —a; γ– with γ the constant path at f —a– , and Ef deformation retracts onto this subspace by restricting all the paths γ to shorter and shorter initial segments. The map p : Ef !B restricts to f on the subspace A , so we have factored an arbitrary map f : A!B as the com- position A > Ef !B of a homotopy equivalence and a ﬁbration. We can also think of this construction as extending f to a ﬁbration Ef !B by enlarging its domain to a homotopy equivalent space. The ﬁber Ff of Ef !B is called the homotopy ﬁber of f . It consists of all pairs —a; γ– with a 2 A and γ a path in B from f —a– to a basepoint b0 2 B . If f : A!B is the inclusion of a subspace, then Ef is the space of paths in B starting at points of A . In this case a map —Ii‡1;@Ii‡1;Ji–!—B;A;x0– is the same as a map —Ii;@Ii–!—Ff ;γ0– where γ0 is the constant path at x0 and Ff is the ﬁber of Ef over x0 . This means that ˇi‡1—B;A;x0– can be identiﬁed with ˇi—Ff ;γ0– , hence the long exact sequences of homotopy groups of the pair —B; A– and of the ﬁbration Ef !B can be identiﬁed. 408 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory An important special case is when f is the inclusion of the basepoint b0 into B . Then Ef is the space PB of paths in B starting at b0 , and p : PB!B sends each path to its endpoint. The ﬁber p−1—b0– is the loopspace ÚB consisting of all loops in B based at b0 . Since PB is contractible by progressively truncating paths, the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the path ﬁbration PB!B yields another proof that ˇn—X; x0– ˇ ˇn−1—ÚX; x0– for all n . As we mentioned in the discussion of loopspaces earlier in this section, it is a theorem of [Milnor 1959] that the loopspace of a CW complex is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. Milnor’s theorem is actually quite a bit more general than this, and implies in particular that the homotopy ﬁber of an arbitrary map between CW complexes has the homotopy type of a CW complex. One can usually avoid quoting these results by using CW approximations, though it is reassuring to know they are available if needed, or if one does not want to bother with CW approximations. If the ﬁbration construction f , Ef is applied to a map p : E!B that is already a ﬁbration, one might expect the resulting ﬁbration Ep!B to be closely related to the original ﬁbration E!B . This is indeed the case: Proposition 4.65. If p : E!B is a ﬁbration, then the inclusion E > Ep is a ﬁber ho- motopy equivalence. In particular, the homotopy ﬁbers of p are homotopy equivalent to the actual ﬁbers. Proof: We apply the homotopy lifting property to the homotopy gt : Ep!B , gt—e; γ– … γ—t– , with initial lift eg0 : Ep!E , eg0—e; γ– … e . The lifting egt : Ep!E is then the ﬁrst coordinate of a homotopy ht : Ep!Ep whose second coordinate is the restriction of the paths γ to the interval ƒt; 1⁄ . Since the endpoints of the paths γ are unchanged, ht is ﬁber-preserving. We have h0 … 11, h1—Ep– ˆ E , and ht—E– ˆ E for all t . Ifwelet i denote the inclusion E > Ep , then ih1 ' 11 via ht and h1i ' 11 via ht jj E ,so i is a ﬁber homotopy equivalence. tu We have seen that loopspaces occur as ﬁbers of ﬁbrations PB!B with con- tractible total space PB . Here is something of a converse: Proposition 4.66. If F!E!B is a ﬁbration or ﬁber bundle with E contractible, then there is a weak homotopy equivalence F!ÚB . Proof: If we compose a contraction of E with the projection p : E!B then we have for each point x 2 E a path γx in B from p—x– to a basepoint b0 … p—x0– , where x0 is the point to which E contracts. This yields a map E!PB , x , γx , whose composition with the ﬁbration PB!B is p . By restriction this¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡! ¡¡¡! F BPB E ¡¡¡! ¡¡¡! B B\u0000 p==gives a map F!ÚB where F … p−1—b0– , and the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for F!E!B maps to the long exact sequence for ÚB!PB!B . Since E and PB are contractible, the ﬁve-lemma implies that the map F!ÚB is a weak homotopy equivalence. tu Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 409 Examples arising from ﬁber bundles constructed earlier in the chapter are O—n– ' ÚGn—R 1– , U—n– ' ÚGn—C 1– , and Sp—n– ' ÚGn—H 1– . In particular, taking n … 1 in the latter two examples, we have S 1 ' ÚCP1 and S 3 ' ÚHP1 . Note that in all these examples it is a topological group that is homotopy equivalent to a loopspace. In [Milnor 1956] this is shown to hold in general: For each topological group G there is a ﬁber bundle G!EG!BG with EG contractible, hence by the proposition there is a weak equivalence G ' ÚBG . There is also a converse statement: The loopspace of a CW complex is homotopy equivalent to a topological group. The relationship between X and ÚX has been much studied, particularly the case that ÚX has the homotopy type of a ﬁnite CW complex, which is of special interest because of the examples of the classical Lie groups such as O—n– , U—n– , and Sp—n– . See [Kane 1988] for an introduction to this subject. It is interesting to see what happens when the process of forming homotopy ﬁbers is iterated. Given a ﬁbration p : E!B with ﬁber F … p−1—b0– , we know that the inclusion of F into the homotopy ﬁber Fp is a homotopy equivalence. Recall that Fp consists of pairs —e; γ– with e 2 E and γ a path in B from p—e– to b0 . The inclusion F > E extends to a map i : Fp!E , i—e; γ– … e , and this map is obviously a ﬁbration. In fact it is the pullback via p of the path ﬁbration PB!B . This allows us to iterate, taking the homotopy ﬁber Fi with its map to Fp , and so on, as in the ﬁrst row of the following diagram: ¡¡¡¡¡!E F ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! F¡¡¡¡¡!FB B\u0000E\u0000 p ¡¡¡¡¡!E¡¡¡¡¡! B p\u0000p ij pi¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! Fj... ... '''==== The actual ﬁber of i over a point e0 2 p−1—b0– consists of pairs —e0;γ– with γ a loop in B at the basepoint b0 , so this ﬁber is just ÚB , and the inclusion ÚB > Fi is a homotopy equivalence. In the second row of the diagram the map ÚB!F is the composition ÚB > Fi!Fp!F where the last map is a homotopy inverse to the inclusion F > Fp , so the square in the diagram containing these maps commutes up to homotopy. The homotopy ﬁber Fi consists of pairs —γ; \u0011– where \u0011 is a path in E ending at e0 and γ is a path in B from p—\u0011—0–– to b0 . A homotopy inverse to the inclusion ÚB > Fi is the retraction Fi!ÚB sending —γ; \u0011– to the loop obtained by composing the inverse path of p\u0011 with γ . These constructions can now be iterated indeﬁnitely. Thus we produce a sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 !Ú 2B!ÚF!ÚE!ÚB!F!E!B where any two consecutive maps form a ﬁbration, up to homotopy equivalence, and all the maps to the left of ÚB are obtained by applying the functor Ú to the later maps. The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for any ﬁbration in the sequence coincides with the long exact sequence for F!E!B , as the reader can check. 410 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Postnikov Towers A Postnikov tower for a path-connected space X is a commutative diagram as at the right, such that:¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡!¡!¡! XX1 X2 X3... (1) The map X!Xn induces an isomorphism on ˇi for i \u0014 n . (2) ˇi—Xn– … 0 for i>n . As we saw in Example 4.17, every connected CW complex X has a Postnikov tower, and this is unique up to homotopy equivalence by Corollary 4.19. If we convert the map Xn!Xn−1 into a ﬁbration, its ﬁber Fn is a K—ˇnX; n– ,as is apparent from a brief inspection of the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the ﬁbration: ˇi‡1—Xn–!ˇi‡1—Xn−1–!ˇi—Fn–!ˇi—Xn–!ˇi—Xn−1– We can replace each map Xn!Xn−1 by a ﬁbration X0 n!X0 n−1 in succession, starting with X2!X1 and working upward. For the inductive step we con-¡! X -n 1 Xn¡! X -n 1 Xn 0 0 > > vert the composition Xn!Xn−1 > X0 n−1 into a ﬁbration X0 n!X0 n−1 ﬁtting into the commutative diagram at the right. Thus we obtain a Postnikov tower satisfying also the condition (3) The map Xn!Xn−1 is a ﬁbration with ﬁber a K—ˇnX; n– . To the extent that ﬁbrations can be regarded as twisted products, up to homotopy equivalence, the spaces Xn in a Postnikov tower for X can be thought of as twisted products of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces K—ˇn—X–; n– . For many purposes, a CW complex X can be replaced by one of the stages Xn in a Postnikov tower for X , for example if one is interested in homotopy or homology groups in only a ﬁnite range of dimensions. However, to determine the full homotopy type of X from its Postnikov tower, some sort of limit process is needed. Let us investigate this question is somewhat greater generality. Given a sequence of maps \u0001\u0001\u0001 !X2!X1 , deﬁne their inverse limit lim -- Xn to be the subspace of the product Q n Xn consisting of sequences of points xn 2 Xn with xn mapping to xn−1 under the map Xn!Xn−1 . The corresponding algebraic notion is the inverse limit lim -- Xn of a sequence of group homomorphisms \u0001\u0001\u0001 !G2!G1 , which is the subgroup of Q n Gn consisting of sequences of elements gn 2 Gn with gn mapping to gn−1 under the homomorphism Gn!Gn−1 . Proposition 4.67. For an arbitrary sequence of ﬁbrations \u0001\u0001\u0001 !X2!X1 the nat- ural map \u0015 : ˇi—lim -- Xn–! lim -- ˇi—Xn– is surjective, and \u0015 is injective if the maps ˇi‡1—Xn–!ˇi‡1—Xn−1– are surjective for n sufﬁciently large. Proof: Represent an element of lim -- ˇi—Xn– by maps fn : —S i;s0–!—Xn;xn– . Since the projection pn : Xn!Xn−1 takes ƒfn⁄ to ƒfn−1⁄ , by applying the homotopy lifting Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 411 property for the pair —S i;s0– we can homotope fn , ﬁxing s0 , so that pnfn … fn−1 . Doing this inductively for n … 2; 3; \u0001\u0001\u0001 , we get pnfn … fn−1 for all n simultaneously, which gives surjectivity of \u0015 . For injectivity, note ﬁrst that inverse limits are unaffected by throwing away a ﬁnite number of terms at the end of the sequence of spaces or groups, so we may assume the maps ˇi‡1—Xn–!ˇi‡1—Xn−1– are surjective for all n . Given a map f : S i! lim -- Xn , suppose we have nullhomotopies Fn : Di‡1!Xn of the coordinate functions fn : S i!Xn of f . We have pnFn … Fn−1 on S i ,so pnFn and Fn−1 are the restrictions to the two hemispheres of S i‡1 of a map gn−1 : S i‡1!Xn−1 . If the map ˇi‡1—Xn–!ˇi‡1—Xn−1– is surjective, we can rechoose Fn so that the new gn−1 is nullhomotopic, that is, so that pnFn ' Fn−1 rel S i . Applying the homotopy lift- ing property for —Di‡1;S i– , we can make pnFn … Fn−1 . Doing this inductively for n … 2; 3; \u0001\u0001\u0001 , we see that f : S i! lim -- Xn is nullhomotopic and \u0015 is injective. tu One might wish to have a description of the kernel of \u0015 in the case of an arbitrary sequence of ﬁbrations \u0001\u0001\u0001 !X2!X1 , though for our present purposes this question is not relevant. In fact, Ker \u0015 is naturally isomorphic to lim -- 1ˇi‡1—Xn– , where lim -- 1 is the functor deﬁned in x3.F. Namely, if f : Si! lim -- Xn determines an element of Ker \u0015 , then the sequence of maps gn : S i‡1!Xn constructed above gives an element of Q n ˇi‡1—Xn– , well-deﬁned up to the choice of the nullhomotopies Fn . Any new choice of Fn is obtained by adding a map Gn : S i‡1!Xn to Fn . The effect of this is to change gn to gn ‡Gn and gn−1 to gn−1 −pnGn . Since lim -- 1ˇi‡1—Xn– is the quotient of Q n ˇi‡1—Xn– under exactly these identiﬁcations, we get Ker \u0015 ˇ lim -- 1ˇi‡1—Xn– . Thus for each i> 0 there is a natural exact sequence 0 -! lim -- 1ˇi‡1—Xn– -! ˇi—lim -- Xn– -! lim -- ˇi—Xn– -! 0 The proposition says that the lim -- 1 term vanishes if the maps ˇi‡1—Xn–!ˇi‡1—Xn−1– are surjective for sufﬁciently large n . Corollary 4.68. For the Postnikov tower of a connected CW complex X the natural map X! lim -- Xn is a weak homotopy equivalence, so X is a CW approximation to lim -- Xn . Proof: The composition ˇi—X– -! ˇi—lim -- Xn– \u0015-----! lim -- ˇi—Xn– is an isomorphism since ˇi—X–!ˇi—Xn– is an isomorphism for large n . tu Having seen how to decompose a space X into the terms in its Postnikov tower, we consider now the inverse process of building a Postnikov tower, starting with X1 as a K—ˇ ; 1– and inductively constructing Xn from Xn−1 . It would be very nice if the ﬁbration K—ˇ ; n–!Xn!Xn−1 could be extended another term to the right, to form a ﬁbration sequence K—ˇ ; n–!Xn!Xn−1!K—ˇ ; n ‡ 1– 412 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory for this would say that Xn is the homotopy ﬁber of a map Xn−1!K—ˇ ; n ‡ 1– , and homotopy classes of such maps are in one-to-one correspondence with elements of Hn‡1—Xn−1; ˇ– by Theorem 4.57. Since the homotopy ﬁber of Xn−1!K—ˇ ; n ‡ 1– is the same as the pullback of the path ﬁbration PK—ˇ ; n ‡ 1–!K—ˇ ; n ‡ 1– , its homotopy type depends only on the homotopy class of the map Xn−1!K—ˇ ; n ‡ 1– , by Proposition 4.62. Note that the last term K—ˇ ; n ‡ 1– in the ﬁbration sequence above cannot be anything else but a K—ˇ ; n‡1– since its loopspace must be homotopy equivalent to the ﬁrst term in the sequence, a K—ˇ ; n– . In general, a ﬁbration F!E!B is called principal if there is a commutative diagram¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! E F¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! F EB B 00B 00\u0000 where the second row is a ﬁbration sequence and the vertical maps are weak ho- motopy equivalences. Thus if all the ﬁbrations in a Postnikov tower for X happen to be principal, we have a diagram as at the right, where each Xn‡1 is, up to weak homo-¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!XK1 X2 X3... X,¼2()3K X,¼1()1 k1 ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! K X,¼3()4K X,¼2()2 k2 ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! K X,¼4()5K X,¼3()3 k3 = topy equivalence, the homotopy ﬁber of the map kn : Xn!K—ˇn‡1;n ‡ 2– . The map kn is equivalent to a class in Hn‡2( Xn; ˇn‡1—K– \u0001 called the n th k invariant of X . These classes specify how to construct X inductively from Eilenberg–MacLane spaces. For example, if all the kn ’s are zero, X is just the product of the spaces K—ˇnX; n– , and in the general case X is some sort of twisted product of K—ˇnX; n– ’s. To actually build a space from its k invariants is usually too unwieldy a procedure to be carried out in practice, but as a theoretical tool this procedure can be quite useful. The next result tells us when this tool is available: Theorem 4.69. A connected CW complex X has a Postnikov tower of principal ﬁbra- tions iff ˇ1—X– acts trivially on ˇn—X– for all n> 1 . Notice that in the deﬁnition of a principal ﬁbration, the map F!ÚB0 automati- cally exists and is a homotopy weak equivalence once one has the right-hand square of the commutative diagram with its vertical maps weak homotopy equivalences. Thus the question of whether a ﬁbration is principal can be rephrased in the following way: Given a map A!X , which one can always replace by an equivalent ﬁbration if one likes, does there exist a ﬁbration F!E!B and a commuta- tive square as at the right, with the vertical maps weak homotopy¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡! A FE X equivalences? By replacing A and X with CW approximations and converting the resulting map A!X into an inclusion via a mapping cylinder, the ques- tion becomes whether a CW pair —X; A– is equivalent to a ﬁbration pair —E; F – , that Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 413 is, whether there is a ﬁbration F!E!B and a map —X; A–!—E; F – for which both X!E and A!F are weak homotopy equivalences. In general the answer will rarely be yes, since the homotopy ﬁber of A > X would have to have the weak homotopy type of a loopspace, which is a rather severe restriction. However, in the situation of Postnikov towers, the homotopy ﬁber is a K—ˇ ; n– with ˇ abelian since n \u0015 2 , so it is a loopspace. But there is another requirement: The action of ˇ1—A– on ˇn—X; A– must be trivial for all n \u0015 1 . This is equivalent to the action of ˇ1—F – on ˇn—E; F – being trivial, which is always the case in a ﬁbration since under the isomorphism p\u0003 : ˇn—E; F –!ˇn—B; x0– an element γ\u000b−\u000b , with γ 2 ˇ1—F – and \u000b 2 ˇn—E; F – , maps to p\u0003—γ–p\u0003—\u000b– − p\u0003—\u000b– which is zero since p\u0003—γ– lies in the trivial group ˇ1—x0– . The relative group ˇn—X; A– is always isomorphic to ˇn−1 of the homotopy ﬁber of the inclusion A > X , so in the case at hand when the homotopy ﬁber is a K—ˇ ; n– , the only nontrivial relative homotopy group is ˇn‡1—X; A– ˇ ˇ . In this case the necessary condition of trivial action is also sufﬁcient: Lemma 4.70. Let —X; A– be a CW pair with both X and A connected, such that the homotopy ﬁber of the inclusion A > X is a K—ˇ ; n– , n \u0015 1 . Then there exists a ﬁ- bration F!E!B and a map —X; A–!—E; F – inducing weak homotopy equivalences X!E and A!F iff the action of ˇ1—A– on ˇn‡1—X; A– is trivial. Proof: It remains only to prove the ‘if’ implication. As we noted just before the statement of the lemma, the groups ˇi—X; A– are zero except for ˇn‡1—X; A– ˇ ˇ . If the action of ˇ1—A– on ˇn‡1—X; A– is trivial, the relative Hurewicz theorem gives an isomorphism ˇn‡1—X; A– ˇ Hn‡1—X; A– . Since —X; A– is n connected, we may assume A contains the n skeleton of X ,so X=A is n connected and the absolute Hurewicz theorem gives ˇn‡1—X=A– ˇ Hn‡1—X=A– . Hence the quotient map X!X=A induces an isomorphism ˇn‡1—X; A– ˇ ˇn‡1—X=A– since the analogous statement for homology is certainly true. Since ˇn‡1—X=A– ˇ ˇ , we can build a K—ˇ ; n ‡ 1– from X=A by attaching cells of dimension n ‡ 3 and greater. This leads to the commutative diagram at the right, where the vertical¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡! ¡¡¡!¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡! A FE XA K(), X/ ¼n 1 k kk + ' maps are inclusions and the lower row is obtained by converting the map k into a ﬁbration. The map A!Fk is a weak homotopy equivalence by the ﬁve-lemma applied to the map between the long exact sequences of homotopy groups for the pairs —X; A– and —Ek;Fk– , since the only nontrivial relative groups are ˇn‡1 , both of which map isomorphically to ˇn‡1—K—ˇ ; n ‡ 1–– . tu Proof of 4.69: In view of the lemma, all that needs to be done is identify the action of ˇ1—X– on ˇn—X– with the action of ˇ1—Xn– on ˇn‡1—Xn−1;Xn– for n \u0015 2 , thinking of the map Xn!Xn−1 as an inclusion. From the exact sequence 0 … ˇn‡1—Xn−1– -! ˇn‡1—Xn−1;Xn– @-----! ˇn—Xn– -! ˇn—Xn−1– … 0 414 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory we have an isomorphism ˇn‡1—Xn−1;Xn– ˇ ˇn—Xn– respecting the action of ˇ1—Xn– . And the map X!Xn induces isomorphisms on ˇ1 and ˇn , so we are done. tu Let us consider now a natural generalization of Postnikov towers, in which one starts with a map f : X!Y between path-connected spaces rather than just a single space X .A Moore–Postnikov tower for f is a commutative diagram¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! XZ Y1 Z2 Z3... as shown at the right, with each composition X!Zn!Y homotopic to f , and such that: (1) The map X!Zn induces an isomorphism on ˇi for i<n and a surjection for i … n . (2) The map Zn!Y induces an isomorphism on ˇi for i>n and an injection for i … n . (3) The map Zn‡1!Zn is a ﬁbration with ﬁber a K—ˇnF; n– where F is the homo- topy ﬁber of f . A Moore–Postnikov tower specializes to a Postnikov tower by taking Y to be a point and then setting Xn … Zn‡1 , discarding the space Z1 which has trivial homotopy groups. Theorem 4.71. Every map f : X!Y between connected CW complexes has a Moore– Postnikov tower, which is unique up to homotopy equivalence. A Moore–Postnikov tower of principal ﬁbrations exists iff ˇ1—X– acts trivially on ˇn—Mf ;X– for all n> 1 , where Mf is the mapping cylinder of f . Proof: The existence and uniqueness of a diagram satisfying (1) and (2) and com- mutative at least up to homotopy follows from Propositions 4.13 and 4.18 applied to the pair —Mf ;X– with Mf the mapping cylinder of f . Having such a diagram, we proceed as in the earlier case of Postnikov towers, replacing each map Zn!Zn−1 by a homotopy equivalent ﬁbration, starting with Z2!Z1 and working upward. We can then apply the homotopy lifting property to make all the triangles in the left half of the tower strictly commutative. After these steps the triangles in the right half of the diagram commute up to homotopy, and to make them strictly commute we can just replace each map to Y by the composition through Z1 . To see that the ﬁbers of the maps Zn‡1!Zn are Eilenberg–MacLane spaces as in condition (3), consider two successive levels of the tower. We may arrange that the maps X!Zn‡1!Zn!Y are inclu- ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!XY Zn 1 Zn + sions by taking mapping cylinders, ﬁrst of X!Zn‡1 , then of the new Zn‡1!Zn , and then of the new Zn!Y . From the left-hand triangle we see that Zn‡1!Zn induces an isomorphism on ˇi for i<n and a surjection for i … n , hence ˇi—Zn;Zn‡1– … 0 for i<n ‡ 1 . Similarly, the other triangle gives ˇi—Zn;Zn‡1– … 0 for i>n ‡ 1 . To show that ˇn‡1—Zn;Zn‡1– ˇ ˇn‡1—Y ; X– we use the following diagram: Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 415 ¼ XXn 1()+ ¼ Yn 1()+ ¼ Xn() ¼ Yn()¼ Yn 1()+ ,¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¼ ZZn 1()+ n 1+ ¼ Yn 1()+ ¼ Zn() ¼ Yn()¼ Yn 1()+ n 1+ n 1+,¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¼ ZZn 1()+ n 1+ ¼ Zn 1()+ ¼ Znnn () ¼ Znn()¼ Zn 1()+ n 1+ n 1+,¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!== == ¼ ¼ The upper-right vertical map is injective and the lower-left vertical map is surjective, so the ﬁve-lemma implies that the two middle vertical maps are isomorphisms. Since the homotopy ﬁber of an inclusion A > B has ˇi equal to ˇi‡1—B; A– , we see that condition (3) is satisﬁed. The statement about a tower of principal ﬁbrations can be obtained as an appli- cation of Lemma 4.70. As we saw in the previous paragraph, there are isomorphisms ˇn‡1—Y ; X– ˇ ˇn‡1—Zn;Zn‡1– , and these respect the action of ˇ1—X– ˇ ˇ1—Zn‡1– ,so Lemma 4.70 gives the result. tu Besides the case that Y is a point, which yields Postnikov towers, another in- teresting special case of Moore–Postnikov towers is when X is a point. In this case the space Zn is an n connected covering of Y , as in Example 4.20. The n connected covering of Y can also be obtained as the homotopy ﬁber of the n th stage Y!Yn of a Postnikov tower for Y . The tower of n connected coverings¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!YK Z 1 Z 2... Y,¼1()1 ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! K Y,¼2()2 ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! K Y,¼3()3 of Y can be realized by principal ﬁbrations by taking Zn to be the homotopy ﬁber of the map Zn−1!K—ˇnY; n– that is the ﬁrst nontrivial stage in a Postnikov tower for Zn−1 . A generalization of the preceding theory allowing nontrivial actions of ˇ1 can be found in [Robinson 1972]. Obstruction Theory It is very common in algebraic topology to encounter situations where one would like to extend or lift a given map. Obvious examples are the homotopy extension and homotopy lifting properties. In their simplest forms, extension and lifting questions can often be phrased in one of the following two ways: The Extension Problem. Given a CW pair —W ; A– and a map A!X , does this extend to a map W!X ? ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!>A W X The Lifting Problem. Given a ﬁbration X!Y and a map W!Y , is there a lift W!X ?¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! WY X In order for the lifting problem to include things like the homotopy lifting property, it should be generalized to a relative form: 416 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory The Relative Lifting Problem. Given a CW pair —W ; A– , a ﬁbra- tion X!Y , and a map W!Y , does there exist a lift W!X extending a given lift on A ?¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!>A WY X Besides reducing to the absolute lifting problem when A …; , this includes the exten- sion problem by taking Y to be a point. Of course, one could broaden these questions by dropping the requirements that —W ; A– be a CW pair and that the map X!Y be a ﬁbration. However, these conditions are often satisﬁed in cases of interest, and they make the task of ﬁnding solutions much easier. The term ‘obstruction theory’ refers to a procedure for deﬁning a sequence of cohomology classes that are the obstructions to ﬁnding a solution to the extension, lifting, or relative lifting problem. In the most favorable cases these obstructions lie in cohomology groups that are all zero, so the problem has a solution. But even when the obstructions are nonzero it can be very useful to have the problem expressed in cohomological terms. There are two ways of developing obstruction theory, which produce essentially the same result in the end. In the more elementary approach one tries to construct the extension or lifting one cell of W at a time, proceeding inductively over skeleta of W . This approach has an appealing directness, but the technical details of working at the level of cochains are perhaps a little tedious. Instead of pursuing this direct line we shall follow the second approach, which is slightly more sophisticated but has the advantage that the theory becomes an almost trivial application of Postnikov towers for the extension problem, or Moore–Postnikov towers for the lifting problem. The cellular viewpoint is explained in [VBKT], where it appears in the study of characteristic classes of vector bundles. Let us consider the extension problem ﬁrst, where we wish to extend a map A!X to the larger complex W . Suppose that X has a Postnikov tower of principal ﬁbrations. Then we have a commutative diagram as shown below, where we have enlarged the tower by adjoining the space X0 , which is just a point, at the¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!>A W X¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! XK1 X0 X2 X3... ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! X,¼2()3 k1 ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! K X,¼3()4 k2 ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! K X,¼4()5 k3 ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! K X,¼1()2 k0 bottom. The map X1!X0 is then a ﬁbration, and to say it is principal says that X1 , which in any case is a K—ˇ1X; 1– , is the loopspace of K—ˇ1X; 2– , hence ˇ1—X– must be abelian. Conversely, if ˇ1—X– is abelian and acts triv- ially on all the higher homotopy groups of X , then there is an extended Postnikov tower of principal ﬁbrations as shown. Our strategy will be to try to lift the constant map W!X0 to maps W!Xn for n … 1; 2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 in succession, extending the given maps A!Xn . If we are able to ﬁnd all these lifts W!Xn , there will then be no difﬁculty in constructing the desired extension W!X . Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 417 For the inductive step we have a com- mutative diagram as at the right. Since Xn¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!>A W X ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! X KK PK X,¼()= n n n 1+-n 1is the pullback, its points are pairs consist- ing of a point in Xn−1 and a path from its image in K to the basepoint. A lift W!Xn therefore amounts to a nullhomotopy of the composition W!Xn−1!K . We already have such a lift deﬁned on A , hence a nullhomotopy of A!K , and we want a nullho- motopy of W!K extending this nullhomotopy on A . The map W!K together with the nullhomotopy on A gives a map W [ CA!K , where CA is the cone on A . Since K is a K—ˇnX; n ‡ 1– , the map W [ CA!K determines an obstruction class !n 2 Hn‡1—W [ CA; ˇnX– ˇ Hn‡1—W ; A; ˇnX– . Proposition 4.72. A lift W!Xn extending the given A!Xn exists iff !n … 0 . Proof: We need to show that the map W [ CA!K extends to a map CW!K iff !n … 0 , or in other words, iff W [ CA!K is homotopic to a constant map. Suppose that gt : W [ CA!K is such a homotopy. The constant map g1 then extends to the constant map g1 : CW!K , so by the homotopy extension property for the pair —CW ; W [ CA– , applied to the reversed homotopy g1−t , we have a homotopy gt : CW!K extending the previous homotopy gt : W [ CA!K . The map g0 : CW!K then extends the given map W [ CA!K . Conversely, if we have an extension CW!K , then this is nullhomotopic since the cone CW is contractible, and we may restrict such a nullhomotopy to W [ CA . tu If we succeed in extending the lifts A!Xn to lifts W!Xn for all n , then we ob- tain a map W! lim -- Xn extending the given A!X! lim -- Xn . Let M be the mapping cylinder of X! lim -- Xn . Since the restriction of W! lim -- Xn ˆ M to A factors through X , this gives a homotopy of this restriction to the map A!X ˆ M . Extend this to a homotopy of W!M , producing a map —W ; A–!—M; X– . Since the map X! lim -- Xn is a weak homotopy equivalence, ˇi—M; X– … 0 for all i , so by Lemma 4.6, the compres- sion lemma, the map —W ; A–!—M; X– can be homotoped to a map W!X extending the given A!X , and we have solved the extension problem. Thus if it happens that at each stage of the inductive process of constructing lifts W!Xn the obstruction !n 2 Hn‡1—W ; A; ˇnX– vanishes, then the extension problem has a solution. In particular, this yields: Corollary 4.73. If X is a connected abelian CW complex and —W ; A– is a CW pair such that Hn‡1—W ; A; ˇnX– … 0 for all n , then every map A!X can be extended to a map W!X . tu This is a considerable improvement on the more elementary result that extensions exist if ˇn—X– … 0 for all n such that W − A has cells of dimension n ‡ 1 , which is an exercise for x4.1. 418 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory We can apply the Hurewicz theorem and obstruction theory to extend the homol- ogy version of Whitehead’s theorem to CW complexes with trivial action of ˇ1 on all homotopy groups: Proposition 4.74. If X and Y are connected abelian CW complexes, then a map f : X!Y inducing isomorphisms on all homology groups is a homotopy equivalence. Proof: Taking the mapping cylinder of f reduces us to the case of an inclusion X>Y of a subcomplex. If we can show that ˇ1—X– acts trivially on ˇn—Y ; X– for all n , then the relative Hurewicz theorem will imply that ˇn—Y ; X– … 0 for all n ,so X!Y will be a weak homotopy equivalence. The assumptions guarantee that ˇ1—X–!ˇ1—Y – is an isomorphism, so we know at least that ˇ1—Y ; X– … 0. We can use obstruction theory to extend the identity map X!X to a retraction Y!X . To apply the theory we need ˇ1—X– acting trivially on ˇn—X– , which holds by hypothesis. Since the inclusion X > Y induces isomorphisms on homology, we have H\u0003—Y ; X– … 0 , hence Hn‡1—Y ; X; ˇn—X–– … 0 for all n by the universal coefﬁcient theorem. So there are no obstructions, and a retraction Y!X exists. This implies that the maps ˇn—Y –!ˇn—Y ; X– are onto, so trivial action of ˇ1—X– on ˇn—Y – implies trivial action on ˇn—Y ; X– by naturality of the action. tu The generalization of the preceding analysis of the extension problem to the rela- tive lifting problem is straightforward. Assuming the ﬁbration p : X!Y in the state- ment of the lifting problem has a Moore–Postnikov tower of principal ﬁbrations, we have the diagram shown at the right. The ﬁrst step is to lift the map W!Y to Z1 , extending the given lift on A . We may take Z1 to be the cov-¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!>A W X ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ZK1 Y Z 2... ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!

K F,¼2()3 p ering space of Y corresponding to the subgroup p\u0003—ˇ1—X–– of ˇ1—Y – , so covering space theory tells us when we can lift W!Y to Z1 , and the unique lifting property for covering spaces can be used to see whether a lift can be chosen to agree with the lift on A given by the diagram; this could only be a problem when A has more than one component. Having a lift to Z1 , the analysis proceeds exactly as before. One encounters a sequence of obstructions !n 2 Hn‡1—W ; A; ˇnF– , assuming ˇ1F is abelian in the case n … 1 . A lift to X exists, extending the given lift on A , if each successive !n is zero. One can ask the converse question: If a lift exists, must the obstructions !n all be zero? Since Proposition 4.72 is an if and only if statement, one might expect the answer to be yes, but upon closer inspection the matter becomes less clear. The difﬁculty is that, even if at some stage the obstruction !n is zero, so a lift to Zn‡1 exists, there may be many choices of such a lift, and different choices could lead to different !n‡1 ’s, some zero and others nonzero. Examples of such ambiguities are not hard to produce, for both the lifting and the extension problems, and the Connections with Cohomology Section 4.3 419 ambiguities only become worse with each subsequent choice of a lift. So it is only in rather special circumstances that one can say that there are well-deﬁned obstructions. A simple case is when ˇi—F – … 0 for i<n , so the Moore– Postnikov factorization begins with Zn as in the diagram at the right. In this¡¡!¡¡!¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!>A W X ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!

Basepoints and Homotopy Section 4.A 421 In the ﬁrst part of this section we will use the action of ˇ1 on ˇn to describe the difference between ˇn—X; x0– and the set of homotopy classes of maps S n!X without conditions on basepoints. More generally, we will compare the set hZ; Xi of basepoint-preserving homotopy classes of maps —Z; z0–!—X; x0– with the set ƒZ; X⁄ of unrestricted homotopy classes of maps Z!X , for Z any CW complex with base- point z0 a0 cell. Then the section concludes with an extended example exhibit- ing some rather subtle nonﬁnite generation phenomena in homotopy and homology groups. We begin by constructing an action of ˇ1—X; x0– on hZ; Xi when Z isaCW complex with basepoint 0 cell z0 . Given a loop γ in X based at x0 and a map f0 : —Z; z0–!—X; x0– , then by the homotopy extension property there is a homotopy fs : Z!X of f0 such that fs—z0– is the loop γ . We might try to deﬁne an action of ˇ1—X; x0– on hZ; Xi by ƒγ⁄ƒf0⁄ … ƒf1⁄ , but this deﬁnition encounters a small problem when we compose loops. For if \u0011 is another loop at x0 , then by applying the homo- topy extension property a second time we get a homotopy of f1 restricting to \u0011 on x0 , and the two homotopies together give the relation ( ƒγ⁄ƒ\u0011⁄\u0001 ƒf0⁄ … ƒ\u0011⁄ ( ƒγ⁄ƒf0⁄\u0001 , in view of our convention that the product γ\u0011 means ﬁrst γ , then \u0011 . This is not quite the relation we want, but the problem is easily corrected by letting the action be an action on the right rather than on the left. Thus we set ƒf0⁄ƒγ⁄ … ƒf1⁄ , and then ƒf0⁄( ƒγ⁄ƒ\u0011⁄\u0001 … ( ƒf0⁄ƒγ⁄ \u0001 ƒ\u0011⁄ . Let us check that this right action is well-deﬁned. Suppose we start with maps f0;g0 : —Z; z0–!—X; x0– representing the same class in hZ; Xi , together with homo- topies fs and gs of f0 and g0 such that fs—z0– and gs—z0– are homotopic loops. These various homotopies deﬁne a map H : Z \u0002 I \u0002 @I [ Z \u0002f0g\u0002 I [fz0g\u0002 I \u0002 I -! X which is fs on Z \u0002 I \u0002f0g , gs on Z \u0002 I \u0002f1g , the basepoint-preserving homotopy from f0 to g0 on Z \u0002f0g\u0002 I , and the homotopy from fs—z0– to gs—z0– on fz0g\u0002 I \u0002 I . We would like to extend H over Z \u0002 I \u0002 I . The pair —I \u0002 I; I \u0002 @I [f0g\u0002 I– is homeo- morphic to —I \u0002 I; I \u0002f0g– , and via this homeomorphism we can view H as a map Z \u0002 I \u0002f0g[fz0g\u0002 I \u0002 I -! X , that is, a map Z \u0002 I!X with a homotopy on the sub- complex fz0g\u0002 I . This means the homotopy extension property can be applied to produce an extension of the original H to Z \u0002 I \u0002 I . Restricting this extended H to Z \u0002f1g\u0002 I gives a basepoint-preserving homotopy f1 ' g1 , which shows that ƒf0⁄ƒγ⁄ is well-deﬁned. Note that in this argument we did not have to assume the homotopies fs and gs were constructed by applying the homotopy extension property. Thus we have proved 422 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory the following result: Proposition 4A.1. There is a right action of ˇ1—X; x0– on hZ; Xi deﬁned by setting ƒf0⁄ƒγ⁄ … ƒf1⁄ whenever there exists a homotopy fs : Z!X from f0 to f1 such that fs—z0– is the loop γ , or any loop homotopic to γ . tu It is easy to convert this right action into a left action, by deﬁning ƒγ⁄ƒf0⁄ … ƒf0⁄ƒγ⁄ −1 . This just amounts to choosing the homotopy fs so that fs—z0– is the inverse path of γ . When Z … S n this action reduces to the usual action of ˇ1—X; x0– on ˇn—X; x0– since in the original deﬁnition of γf in terms of maps —In;@In–!—X; x0– , a homotopy from γf to f is obtained by restricting γf to smaller and smaller concentric cubes, and on the ‘basepoint’ @In this homotopy traces out the loop γ . Proposition 4A.2. If —Z; z0– is a CW pair and X is a path-connected space, then the natural map hZ; Xi!ƒZ; X⁄ induces a bijection of the orbit set hZ; Xi=ˇ1—X; x0– onto ƒZ; X⁄ . In particular, this implies that ƒZ; X⁄ …hZ; Xi if X is simply-connected. Proof: Since X is path-connected, every f : Z!X can be homotoped to take z0 to the basepoint x0 , via homotopy extension, so the map hZ; Xi!ƒZ; X⁄ is onto. If f0 and f1 are basepoint-preserving maps that are homotopic via the homotopy fs : Z!X , then by deﬁnition ƒf1⁄ … ƒf0⁄ƒγ⁄ for the loop γ—s– … fs—z0– ,so ƒf0⁄ and ƒf1⁄ are in the same orbit under the action of ˇ1—X; x0– . Conversely, two basepoint-preserving maps in the same orbit are obviously homotopic. tu Example 4A.3.If X is an H–space with identity element x0 , then the action of ˇ1—X; x0– on hZ; Xi is trivial since for a map f : —Z; z0–!—X; x0– and a loop γ in X based at x0 , the multiplication in X deﬁnes a homotopy fs—z– … f—z–γ—s– . This starts and ends with a map homotopic to f , and the loop fs—z0– is homotopic to γ , both these homotopies being basepoint-preserving by the deﬁnition of an H–space. The set of orbits of the ˇ1 action on ˇn does not generally inherit a group struc- ture from ˇn . For example, when n … 1 the orbits are just the conjugacy classes in ˇ1 , and these form a group only when ˇ1 is abelian. Basepoints are thus a necessary technical device for producing the group structure in homotopy groups, though as we have shown, they can be ignored in simply-connected spaces. For a set of maps S n!X to generate ˇn—X– as a module over Zƒˇn—X–⁄ means that all elements of ˇn—X– can be represented by sums of these maps along arbitrary paths in X , where we allow reversing orientations to get negatives and repetitions to get arbitrary integer multiples. Examples of ﬁnite CW complexes X for which ˇn—X– is not ﬁnitely generated as a module over Zƒˇn—X–⁄ were given in Exercise 38 in x4.2, provided n \u0015 3 . Finding such an example for n … 2 seems to be more difﬁcult. The Basepoints and Homotopy Section 4.A 423 rest of this section will be devoted to a somewhat complicated construction which does this, and is interesting for other reasons as well. An Example of Nonﬁnite Generation We will construct a ﬁnite CW complex having ˇn not ﬁnitely generated as a Zƒˇ1⁄ module, for a given integer n \u0015 2 . The complex will be a subcomplex of a K—ˇ ; 1– having interesting homological properties: It is an —n ‡ 1– dimensional CW complex with Hn‡1 nonﬁnitely generated, but its n skeleton is ﬁnite so Hi is ﬁnitely generated for i \u0014 n and ˇ is ﬁnitely presented if n> 1 . The ﬁrst such example was found in [Stallings 1963] for n … 2 . Our construction will be essentially the n dimensional generalization of this, but described in a more geometric way as in [Bestvina & Brady 1997], which provides a general technique for constructing many examples of this sort. To begin, let X be the product of n copies of S1 _ S 1 . Since S 1 _ S 1 is the 1 skeleton of the torus T 2 … S 1 \u0002 S 1 in its usual CW structure, X can be regarded as a subcomplex of the 2n dimensional torus T 2n , the product of 2n circles. Deﬁne f : T 2n!S 1 by f—\u00121; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;\u00122n– … \u00121 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ \u00122n where the coordinates \u0012i 2 S 1 are viewed as angles measured in radians. The space Z … X \\ f −1—0– will provide the example we are looking for. As we shall see, Z is a ﬁnite CW complex of dimension n − 1 , with ˇn−1—Z– nonﬁnitely generated as a module over ˇ1—Z– if n \u0015 3 . We will also see that ˇi—Z– … 0 for 1 <i<n − 1. The induced homomorphism f\u0003 : ˇ1—T 2n–!ˇ1—S 1– … Z sends each generator coming from an S 1 factor to 1 . Let eT 2n!T 2n be the covering space corresponding to the kernel of f\u0003 . This is a normal covering space since it corresponds to a normal subgroup, and the deck transformation group is Z . The subcomplex of eT 2n projecting to X is a normal covering space eX!X with the same group of deck transformations. Since ˇ1—X– is the product of n free groups on two generators, eX is the covering space of X corresponding to the kernel of the homomorphism ˇ1—X–!Z sending each of the two generators of each free factor to 1 . Since X is a K—ˇ ; 1– ,so is eX . For example, when n … 1, eX is the union of two helices on the inﬁnite cylinder eT 2 : The map f lifts to a map ef : eT 2n!R , and Z lifts homeomorphically to a subspace Z ˆ eX , namely ef −1—0– \\ eX . We will show: —\u0003– eX is homotopy equivalent to a space Y obtained from Z by attaching an inﬁnite sequence of n cells. Assuming this is true, it follows that Hn—Y – is not ﬁnitely generated since in the exact sequence Hn—Z–!Hn—Y –!Hn—Y ; Z–!Hn−1—Z– the ﬁrst term is zero and the last term is ﬁnitely generated, Z being a ﬁnite CW complex of dimension n − 1, 424 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory while the third term is an inﬁnite sum of Z ’s, one for each n cell of Y .If ˇn−1—Z– were ﬁnitely generated as a ˇ1—Z– module, then by attaching ﬁnitely many n cells to Z we could make it —n − 1– connected since it is already —n − 2– connected as the —n − 1– skeleton of the K—ˇ ; 1–Y . Then by attaching cells of dimension greater than n we could build a K—ˇ ; 1– with ﬁnite n skeleton. But this contradicts the fact that Hn—Y – is not ﬁnitely generated. To begin the veriﬁcation of —\u0003– , consider the torus T m . The standard cell struc- ture on T m lifts to a cubical cell structure on the universal cover R m , with vertices the integer lattice points Zm . The function f lifts to a linear projection L : R m!R , L—x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xm– … x1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ xm . The planes in L −1—Z– cut the cubes of R m into convex polyhedra which we call slabs. There are m slabs in each m dimensional cube. The boundary of a slab in L −1ƒi; i ‡ 1⁄ con- sists of lateral faces that are slabs for lower-dimensional cubes, to- gether with a lower face in L −1—i– and an upper face in L −1—i ‡ 1– . In each cube there are two exceptional slabs whose lower or upper face degenerates to a point. These are the slabs containing the vertices of the cube where L has its maximum and minimum values. A slab defor- mation retracts onto the union of its lower and lateral faces, provided that the slab has an upper face that is not just a point. Slabs of the latter type are m simplices, and we will refer to them as cones in what follows. These are the slabs containing the vertex of a cube on which L takes its maximal value. The lateral faces of a cone are also cones, of lower dimension. The slabs, together with all their lower-dimensional faces, give a CW structure on Rm with the planes of L −1—Z– as subcomplexes. These structures are preserved by the deck transformations of the cover Rm!T m so there is an induced CW structure in the quotient T m , with f −1—0– as a subcomplex. If X is any subcomplex of T m in its original cubical cell structure, then the slab CW structure on T m restricts to a CW structure on X . In particular, we obtain a CW structure on Z … X \\ f −1—0– . Likewise we get a lifted CW structure on the cover eX ˆ eT m . Let eXƒi; j⁄ … eX \\ ef −1ƒi; j⁄ . The deformation retractions of noncone slabs onto their lateral and lower faces give rise to a deformation retraction of eXƒi; i ‡ 1⁄ onto eXƒi⁄ [ Ci where Ci consists of all the cones in eXƒi; i ‡ 1⁄ . These cones are attached along their lower faces, and they all have the same vertex in eXƒi ‡ 1⁄ ,so Ci is itself a cone in the usual sense, attached to eXƒi⁄ along its base. For the particular X we are interested in, we claim that each Ci is an n disk attached along its boundary sphere. When n … 1 this is evident from the earlier picture of eX as the union of two helices on a cylinder. For larger n we argue by induction. Passing from n to n ‡ 1 replaces X by two copies of X \u0002 S 1 intersecting in X , one copy for each of the additional S 1 factors of T 2n‡2 . Replacing X by X \u0002 S 1 changes Ci to its join with a point in the base of the new Ci . Doing this twice produces Basepoints and Homotopy Section 4.A 425 the suspension of Ci attached along the suspension of the base. The same argument shows that eXƒ−i − 1; −i⁄ deformation retracts onto eXƒ−i⁄ with an n cell attached. We build the space Y and a homotopy equivalence g : Y! eX by an inductive procedure, starting with Y0 … Z . Assuming that Yi and a homotopy equivalence gi : Yi! eXƒ−i; i⁄ have already been deﬁned, we form Yi‡1 by attaching two n cells by the maps obtained from the attaching maps of the two n cells in eXƒ−i − 1;i ‡ 1⁄ − eXƒ−i; i⁄ by composing with a homotopy inverse to gi . This allows gi to be extended to a homotopy equivalence gi‡1 : Yi‡1! eXƒ−i − 1;i ‡ 1⁄ . Taking the union over i gives g : Y! eX . One can check this is a homotopy equivalence by seeing that it induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups, using the standard compact- ness argument. This ﬁnishes the veriﬁcation of —\u0003– . It is interesting to see what the complex Z looks like in the case n … 3 , when Z is 2 dimensional and has ˇ2 nonﬁnitely generated over Zƒˇ1—Z–⁄ . In this case X is the product of three S 1 _ S 1 ’s, so X is the union of the eight 3 tori obtained by choosing one of the two S 1 summands in each S 1 _ S 1 factor. We denote these 3 tori S 1 \u0006 \u0002 S 1 \u0006 \u0002 S 1 \u0006 . Viewing each of these 3 tori as the cube in the previous ﬁgure with opposite faces identiﬁed, we see that Z is the union of the eight 2 tori formed by the two sloping triangles in each cube. Two of these 2 tori intersect along a circle when the corresponding 3 tori of X intersect along a 2 torus. This happens when the triples of \u0006 ’s for the two 3 tori differ in exactly one entry. The pattern of intersection of the eight 2 tori of Z can thus be described combinatorially via the 1 skeleton of the cube, with vertices —\u00061; \u00061; \u00061– . There is a torus of Z for each vertex of the cube, and two tori intersect along a circle when the corresponding vertices of the cube are the endpoints of an edge of the cube. All eight tori contain the single 0 cell of Z . To obtain a model of Z itself, consider a regular octahedron inscribed in the cube with vertices —\u00061; \u00061; \u00061– . If we identify each pair of oppo- site edges of the octahedron, each pair of opposite triangular faces becomes a torus. However, there are only four pairs of opposite faces, so we get only four tori this way, not eight. To correct this problem, regard each triangular face of the oc- tagon as two copies of the same triangle, distinguished from each other by a choice of normal direction, an arrow attached to the triangle pointing either inside the octahedron or outside it, that is, either to- ward the nearest vertex of the surrounding cube or toward the opposite vertex of the cube. Then each pair of opposite triangles of the octahedron having normal vectors pointing toward the same vertex of the cube determines a torus, when opposite edges are identiﬁed as before. Each edge of the original octahedron is also replaced by two edges oriented either toward the interior or exterior of the octahedron. The vertices of the octahedron may be left unduplicated since they will all be identiﬁed to a single point anyway. With this scheme, the two tori corresponding to the vertices at the ends 426 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory of an edge of the cube then intersect along a circle, as they should, and other pairs of tori intersect only at the 0 cell of Z . This model of Z has the advantage of displaying the symmetry group of the cube, a group of order 48 , as a symmetry group of Z , corresponding to the symmetries of X permuting the three S 1 _ S 1 factors and the two S 1 ’s of each S 1 _ S 1 . Undoubtedly Z would be very pretty to look at if we lived in a space with enough dimensions to see all of it at one glance. It might be interesting to see an explicit set of maps S 2!Z generating ˇ2—Z– as a Zƒˇ1⁄ module. One might also ask whether there are simpler examples of these nonﬁnite generation phenomena.

(b) Letting eXn denote the n dimensional complex eX , show that eXn can be obtained inductively from eXn−1 as the union of two copies of the mapping torus of the gener- ating deck transformation eXn−1! eXn−1 , with copies of eXn−1 in these two mapping tori identiﬁed. Thus there is a ﬁber bundle eXn!S 1 _ S 1 with ﬁber eXn−1 . (c) Use part (b) to ﬁnd a presentation for ˇ1— eXn– , and show this presentation reduces to a ﬁnite presentation if n> 2 and a presentation with a ﬁnite number of generators if n … 2 . In the latter case, deduce that ˇ1— eX2– has no ﬁnite presentation from the fact that H2— eX2– is not ﬁnitely generated. The Hopf Invariant Section 4.B 427 In x2.2 we used homology to distinguish different homotopy classes of maps S n!S n via the notion of degree. We will show here that cup product can be used to do something similar for maps S 2n−1!S n . Originally this was done by Hopf using more geometric constructions, before the invention of cohomology and cup products. In general, given a map f : S m!S n with m \u0015 n , we can form a CW complex Cf by attaching a cell em‡1 to S n via f . The homotopy type of Cf depends only on the homotopy class of f , by Proposition 0.18. Thus for maps f; g : S m!S n , any invariant of homotopy type that distinguishes Cf from Cg will show that f is not homotopic to g . For example, if m … n and f has degree d , then from the cellular chain complex of Cf we see that Hn—Cf – ˇ Zjdj , so the homology of Cf detects the degree of f ,up to sign. When m> n , however, the homology of Cf consists of Z ’s in dimensions 0, n , and m ‡ 1 , independent of f . The same is true of cohomology groups, but cup products have a chance of being nontrivial in H\u0003—Cf – when m … 2n − 1 . In this case, if we choose generators \u000b 2 Hn—Cf – and \f 2 H2n—Cf – , then the multiplicative structure of H\u0003—Cf – is determined by a relation \u000b 2 … H—f –\f for an integer H—f – called the Hopf invariant of f . The sign of H—f – depends on the choice of the gener- ator \f , but this can be speciﬁed by requiring \f to correspond to a ﬁxed generator of H2n—D2n;@D2n– under the map H2n—Cf – ˇ H2n—Cf ;S n–!H2n—D2n;@D2n– induced by the characteristic map of the cell e2n , which is determined by f . We can then change the sign of H—f – by composing f with a reﬂection of S 2n−1 , of degree −1. If f ' g , then under the homotopy equivalence Cf ' Cg the chosen generators \f for H2n—Cf – and H2n—Cg– correspond, so H—f – depends only on the homotopy class of f . If f is a constant map then Cf … S n _ S 2n and H—f – … 0 since Cf retracts onto S n . Also, H—f – is always zero for odd n since in this case \u000b 2 …−\u000b 2 by the commutativity property of cup product, hence \u000b2 … 0. Three basic examples of maps with nonzero Hopf invariant are the maps deﬁning the three Hopf bundles in Examples 4.45, 4.46, and 4.47. The ﬁrst of these Hopf maps is the attaching map f : S 3!S 2 for the 4 cell of CP 2 . This has H—f – … 1 since H\u0003—CP2; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b 3– by Theorem 3.12. Similarly, HP2 gives rise to a map S 7!S 4 of Hopf invariant 1 . In the case of the octonionic projective plane OP2 , which is built from the map S 15!S 8 deﬁned in Example 4.47, we can deduce that H\u0003—OP2; Z– ˇ Zƒ\u000b⁄=—\u000b 3– either from Poincar´e duality as in Example 3.40 or from Exercise 5 for x4.D. It is a fundamental theorem of [Adams 1960] that a map f : S 2n−1!S n of Hopf invariant 1 exists only when n … 2; 4; 8 . This has a number of very interesting con- sequences, for example: 428 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory R n is a division algebra only for n … 1; 2; 4; 8. S n is an H–space only for n … 0; 1; 3; 7. S n has n linearly independent tangent vector ﬁelds only for n … 0; 1; 3; 7. The only ﬁber bundles S p!S q!S r occur when —p;q;r – … —0; 1; 1– , —1; 3; 2– , —3; 7; 4– , and —7; 15; 8– . The ﬁrst and third assertions were in fact proved shortly before Adams’ theorem in [Kervaire 1958] and [Milnor 1958] as applications of a theorem of Bott that ˇ2nU—n– ˇ Zn! . A full discussion of all this, and a proof of Adams’ theorem, is given in [VBKT]. Though maps of Hopf invariant 1 are rare, there are maps S 2n−1!S n of Hopf invariant 2 for all even n . Namely, consider the space J2—S n– constructed in x3.2. This has a CW structure with three cells, of dimensions 0 , n , and 2n ,so J2—S n– has the form Cf for some f : S 2n−1!S n . We showed that if n is even, the square of a generator of Hn—J2—S n–; Z– is twice a generator of H2n—J2—S n–; Z– ,so H—f – …\u00062. From this example we can get maps of any even Hopf invariant when n is even via the following fact. Proposition 4B.1. The Hopf invariant H : ˇ2n−1—S n–!Z is a homomorphism. Proof: For f; g : S 2n−1!S n , let us compare Cf ‡g with the space Cf _g obtained from S n by attaching two 2n cells via f and g . There is a natural quotient map q : Cf ‡g!Cf _g collapsing the equatorial disk of the 2n cell of Cf ‡g to a point. The in- duced cellular chain map q\u0003 sends e2n f ‡g to e2n f ‡e2n g . In cohomology this implies that q\u0003—\ff – … q\u0003—\fg– … \ff ‡g where \ff , \fg , and \ff ‡g are the cohomology classes dual to the 2n cells. Letting \u000bf ‡g and \u000bf _g be the cohomology classes corresponding to the n cells, we have q\u0003—\u000bf _g– … \u000bf ‡g since q is a homeomorphism on the n cells. By re- stricting to the subspaces Cf and Cg of Cf _g we see that \u000b 2 f _g … H—f –\ff ‡ H—g–\fg . Thus \u000b2 f ‡g … q\u0003—\u000b 2 f _g– … H—f –q\u0003—\ff – ‡ H—g–q\u0003—\fg– … ( H—f – ‡ H—g–\u0001 \ff ‡g . tu Corollary 4B.2. ˇ2n−1—S n– contains a Z direct summand when n is even. Proof: Either H or H=2 is a surjective homomorphism ˇ2n−1—S n–!Z . tu Exercises 1. Show that the Hopf invariant of a composition S 2n−1 f -----! S 2n−1 g -----! S n is given by H—gf – … —deg f–H—g– , and for a composition S 2n−1 f -----! S n g -----! S n the Hopf invariant satisﬁes H—gf – … —deg g–2H—f – . 2. Show that if S k -! S m p -----! S n is a ﬁber bundle, then m … 2n − 1, k … n − 1 , and, when n> 1, H—p– …\u00061 . [Show that Cp is a manifold and apply Poincar´e duality.] Minimal Cell Structures Section 4.C 429 We can apply the homology version of Whitehead’s theorem, Corollary 4.33, to show that a simply-connected CW complex with ﬁnitely generated homology groups is always homotopy equivalent to a CW complex having the minimum number of cells consistent with its homology, namely, one n cell for each Z summand of Hn and a pair of cells of dimension n and n ‡ 1 for each Zk summand of Hn . Proposition 4C.1. Given a simply-connected CW complex X and a decomposition of each of its homology groups Hn—X– as a direct sum of cyclic groups with speci- ﬁed generators, then there is a CW complex Z and a cellular homotopy equivalence f : Z!X such that each cell of Z is either : (a) a ‘generator’ n cell en \u000b , which is a cycle in cellular homology mapped by f to a cellular cycle representing the speciﬁed generator \u000b of one of the cyclic sum- mands of Hn—X– ; or (b) a ‘relator’ —n ‡ 1– cell en‡1 \u000b , with cellular boundary equal to a multiple of the generator n cell en \u000b , in the case that \u000b has ﬁnite order. In the nonsimply-connected case this result can easily be false, counterexamples being provided by acyclic spaces and the space X … —S 1 _ S n– [ en‡1 constructed in Example 4.35, which has the same homology as S 1 but which must have cells of dimension greater than 1 in order to have ˇn nontrivial. Proof: We build Z inductively over skeleta, starting with Z 1 a point since X is simply- connected. For the inductive step, suppose we have constructed f : Z n!X inducing an isomorphism on Hi for i<n and a surjection on Hn . For the mapping cylinder Mf we then have Hi—Mf ;Z n– … 0 for i \u0014 n and Hn‡1—Mf ;Z n– ˇ ˇn‡1—Mf ;Z n– by the Hurewicz theorem. To construct Zn‡1 we use the following diagram: n XHn 1() XHn()+ n 1()+ MHn 1()+ ¼ f MZHn 1() n ZHn( H 0n())+ n 1+ f Mf¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!, n Hn 1()+ ZZ n 1+ Z n 1+ Z Hn 1() n ZHn( H 0n())+¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!, n MZf ,==¼¼¼ By induction we know the map Hn—Z n–!Hn—Mf – ˇ Hn—X– exactly, namely, Z n has generator n cells, which are cellular cycles mapping to the given generators of Hn—X– , along with relator n cells that do not contribute to Hn—Z n– . Thus Hn—Z n– is free with basis the generator n cells, and the kernel of Hn—Z n–!Hn—X– is free with basis given by certain multiples of some of the generator n cells. Choose ‘relator’ elements ˆi in Hn‡1—Mf ;Z n– mapping to this basis for the kernel, and let the ‘generator’ elements γi 2 Hn‡1—Mf ;Z n– be the images of the chosen generators of Hn‡1—Mf – ˇ Hn‡1—X– . Via the Hurewicz isomorphism Hn‡1—Mf ;Z n– ˇ ˇn‡1—Mf ;Z n– , the homology classes ˆi and γi are represented by maps ri;gi : —Dn‡1;S n–!—Mf ;Z n– . We form 430 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Z n‡1 from Z n by attaching —n ‡ 1– cells via the restrictions of the maps ri and gi to S n . The maps ri and gi themselves then give an extension of the inclusion Z n > Mf to a map Z n‡1!Mf , whose composition with the retraction Mf !X is the extended map f : Z n‡1!X . This gives us the lower row of the preceding diagram, with commutative squares. By construction, the subgroup of Hn‡1—Z n‡1;Z n– gener- ated by the relator —n ‡ 1– cells maps injectively to Hn—Z n– , with image the kernel of Hn—Z n–!Hn—X– ,so f\u0003 : Hn—Z n‡1–!Hn—X– is an isomorphism. The elements of Hn‡1—Z n‡1;Z n– represented by the generator —n‡1– cells map to the γi ’s, hence map to zero in Hn—Z n–; so by exactness of the second row these generator —n ‡ 1– cells are cellular cycles representing elements of Hn‡1—Z n‡1– mapped by f\u0003 to the given generators of Hn‡1—X– . In particular, f\u0003 : Hn‡1—Z n‡1–!Hn‡1—X– is surjective, and the induction step is ﬁnished. Doing this for all n , we produce a CW complex Z and a map f : Z!X with the desired properties. tu Example 4C.2. Suppose X is a simply-connected CW complex such that for some n \u0015 2 , the only nonzero reduced homology groups of X are Hn—X– , which is ﬁnitely generated, and Hn‡1—X– , which is ﬁnitely generated and free. Then the proposition says that X is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex Z obtained from a wedge sum of n spheres by attaching —n ‡ 1– cells. The attaching maps of these cells are de- termined up to homotopy by the cellular boundary map Hn‡1—Z n‡1;Z n–!Hn—Z n– since ˇn—Z n– ˇ Hn—Z n– . So the attaching maps are either trivial, in the case of gen- erator —n ‡ 1– cells, or they represent some multiple of an inclusion of one of the wedge summands, in the case of a relator —n ‡ 1– cell. Hence Z is the wedge sum of spheres S n and S n‡1 together with Moore spaces M—Zm;n– of the form S n [ en‡1 .In particular, the homotopy type of X is uniquely determined by its homology groups. Proposition 4C.3. Let X be a simply-connected space homotopy equivalent to a CW complex, such that the only nontrivial reduced homology groups of X are H2—X– ˇ Zm and H4—X– ˇ Z . Then the homotopy type of X is uniquely determined by the cup product ring H\u0003—X; Z– . In particular, this applies to any simply-connected closed 4 manifold. Proof: By the previous proposition we may assume X is a complex X' obtained from a wedge sum W j S 2 j of m 2 spheres S 2 j by attaching a cell e4 via a map ' : S 3!W j S 2 j . As shown in Example 4.52, ˇ3—W j S 2 j – is free with basis the Hopf maps \u0011j : S 3!S 2 j and the Whitehead products ƒij;ik⁄ , j< k , where ij is the inclusion S 2 j > W j S 2 j . Since a homotopy of ' does not change the homotopy type of X' , we may assume ' is a linear combination Pj aj\u0011j ‡ Pj<k ajkƒij;ik⁄ . We need to see how the coefﬁcients aj and ajk determine the cup product H2—X; Z–\u0002 H2—X; Z–!H4—X; Z– . This cup product can be represented by an m\u0002 m symmetric matrix —bjk– where the cup product of the cohomology classes dual to the j th and k th 2-cells is bjk Cohomology of Fiber Bundles Section 4.D 431 times the class dual to the 4 cell. We claim that bjk … ajk for j< k and bjj … aj . If ' is one of the generators \u0011i or ƒij;ik⁄ this is clear, since if ' … \u0011j then X' is the wedge sum of CP2 with m − 12 spheres, while if ' … ƒij;ik⁄ then X' is the wedge sum of S 2 j \u0002 S 2 k with m − 22 spheres. The claim is also true when ' is −\u0011j or −ƒij;ik⁄ since changing the sign of ' amounts to composing ' with a reﬂection of S 3 , and this changes the generator of H4—X'; Z– to its negative. The general case now follows by induction from the assertion that the matrix —bjk– for X'‡ is the sum of the corresponding matrices for X' and X . This assertion can be proved as follows. By attaching two 4 cells to W j S 2 j by ' and we obtain a complex X'; which we can view as X' [ X . There is a quotient map q : X'‡ -! X'; that is a homeomorphism on the 2 skeleton and collapses the closure of an equatorial 3 disk in the 4 cell of X'‡ to a point. The induced map q\u0003 : H4—X'; –!H4—X'‡ – sends each of the two generators corresponding to the 4 cells of X'; to a generator, and the assertion follows. Now suppose X' and X have isomorphic cup product rings. This means bases for H\u0003—X'; Z– and H\u0003—X ; Z– can be chosen so that the matrices specifying the cup product H2 \u0002 H2!H4 with respect to these bases are the same. The preceding propo- sition says that any choice of basis can be realized as the dual basis to a cell structure on a CW complex homotopy equivalent to the given complex. Therefore we may as- sume the matrices —bjk– for X' and X are the same. By what we have shown in the preceding paragraph, this means ' and are homotopic, hence X' and X are homotopy equivalent. For the statement about simply-connected closed 4 manifolds, Corollaries A.8 and A.9 and Proposition A.11 in the Appendix say that such a manifold M has the ho- motopy type of a CW complex with ﬁnitely generated homology groups. Then Poincar´e duality and the universal coefﬁcient theorem imply that the only nontrivial homology groups Hi—M– are Z for i … 0; 4 and Z m for i … 2 , for some m \u0015 0. tu This result and the example preceding it are special cases of a homotopy classi- ﬁcation by Whitehead of simply-connected CW complexes with positive-dimensional cells in three adjacent dimensions n , n ‡ 1 , and n ‡ 2 ; see [Baues 1996] for a full treatment of this. While the homotopy groups of the three spaces in a ﬁber bundle ﬁt into a long exact sequence, the relation between their homology or cohomology groups is much more complicated. The K¨unneth formula shows that there are some subtleties even for a product bundle, and for general bundles the machinery of spectral sequences, 432 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory developed in [SSAT], is required. In this section we will describe a few special sorts of ﬁber bundles where more elementary techniques sufﬁce. As applications we calculate the cohomology rings of some important spaces closely related to Lie groups. In particular we ﬁnd a number of spaces with exterior and polynomial cohomology rings. The Leray–Hirsch Theorem This theorem will be the basis for all the other results in this section. It gives hypotheses sufﬁcient to guarantee that a ﬁber bundle has cohomology very much like that of a product bundle. Theorem 4D.1. Let F -! E p -----! B be a ﬁber bundle such that, for some commutative coefﬁcient ring R : (a) Hn—F ; R– is a ﬁnitely generated free R module for each n . (b) There exist classes cj 2 Hkj —E; R– whose restrictions i \u0003—cj– form a basis for H\u0003—F ; R– in each ﬁber F , where i : F!E is the inclusion. Then the map Ø : H\u0003—B; R– ⊗R H\u0003—F ; R–!H\u0003—E; R– , P ij bi ⊗ i \u0003—cj–,Pij p\u0003—bi–`cj , is an isomorphism. In other words, H\u0003—E; R– is a free H\u0003—B; R– module with basis fcjg , where we view H\u0003—E; R– as a module over the ring H\u0003—B; R– by deﬁning scalar multiplication by bc … p\u0003—b– ` c for b 2 H\u0003—B; R– and c 2 H\u0003—E; R– . In the case of a product E … B \u0002 F with H\u0003—F ; R– free over R , we can pull back a basis for H\u0003—F ; R– via the projection E!F to obtain the classes cj . Thus the Leray–Hirsch theorem generalizes the version of the K¨unneth formula involving cup products, Theorem 3.16, at least as far as the additive structure and the module struc- ture over H \u0003—B; R– are concerned. However, the Leray–Hirsch theorem does not assert that the isomorphism H\u0003—E; R– ˇ H\u0003—B; R– ⊗R H\u0003—F ; R– is a ring isomorphism, and in fact this need not be true, as we shall see by an example later. An example of a bundle where the classes cj do not exist is the Hopf bundle S 1!S 3!S 2 , since H\u0003—S 3– 6ˇ H\u0003—S 2– ⊗ H\u0003—S 1– . Proof: We ﬁrst prove the result for ﬁnite-dimensional CW complexes B by induction on their dimension. The case that B is 0 dimensional is trivial. For the induction step, suppose B has dimension n , and let B0 ˆ B be the subspace obtained by deleting a point x\u000b from the interior of each n cell en \u000b of B . Let E0 … p−1—B0– . Then we have a commutative diagram, with coefﬁcients in R understood: B RBH () ) ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! , ¤ FH ( ¤00\u0000 B RH () ) ¤ FH ( ¤\u0000 ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!B RH () ) ¤ FH ( ¤\u0000... EEH ()¡¡¡¡¡! , ¤ 0 EEH ()¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¤ H () ¤ 0... ... ... Ø¡¡!Ø¡¡!Ø The map Ø on the left is deﬁned exactly as in the absolute case, using the relative cup product H\u0003—E; E0– ⊗R H\u0003—E–!H\u0003—E; E0– . The ﬁrst row of the diagram is exact since Cohomology of Fiber Bundles Section 4.D 433 tensoring with a free module preserves exactness. The second row is of course exact also. The commutativity of the diagram follows from the evident naturality of Ø in the case of the two squares shown. For the other square involving coboundary maps, if we start with an element b ⊗ i \u0003—cj– 2 H\u0003—B0– ⊗R H\u0003—F – and map this horizontally we get \u000eb ⊗ i \u0003—cj– which maps vertically to p\u0003—\u000eb–`cj , whereas if we ﬁrst map vertically we get p\u0003—b–`cj which maps horizontally to \u000e—p\u0003—b–`cj– … \u000ep\u0003—b–`cj … p\u0003—\u000eb–`cj since \u000ecj … 0. The space B0 deformation retracts onto the skeleton Bn−1 , and the following lemma implies that the inclusion p−1—Bn−1– > E0 is a weak homotopy equivalence, hence induces an isomorphism on all cohomology groups: Lemma 4D.2. Given a ﬁber bundle p : E!B and a subspace A ˆ B such that —B; A– is k connected, then ( E; p−1—A– \u0001 is also k connected. Proof: For a map g : —Di;@Di–! ( E; p−1—A– \u0001 with i \u0014 k , there is by hypothesis a homotopy ft : —Di;@Di–!—B; A– of f0 … pg to a map f1 with image in A . The ho- motopy lifting property then gives a homotopy gt : —Di;@Di–! ( E; p−1—A– \u0001 of g to a map with image in p−1—A– . tu The theorem for ﬁnite-dimensional B will now follow by induction on n and the ﬁve-lemma once we show that the left-hand Ø in the diagram is an isomorphism. By the ﬁber bundle property there are open disk neighborhoods U\u000b ˆ en \u000b of the points x\u000b such that the bundle is a product over each U\u000b . Let U … S \u000b U\u000b and let U 0 … U \\ B0 . By excision we have H\u0003—B; B0– ˇ H\u0003—U; U 0– , and H\u0003—E; E0– ˇ H\u0003( p−1—U–; p−1—U 0–\u0001 . This gives a reduction to the problem of showing that the map Ø : H\u0003—U; U 0– ⊗R H\u0003—F –!H\u0003—U \u0002 F; U 0 \u0002 F– is an isomorphism. For this we can either appeal to the relative K¨unneth formula in Theorem 3.21 or we can argue again by induction, applying the ﬁve-lemma to the diagram with —B; B0– replaced by —U; U 0– , induction implying that the theorem holds for U and U 0 since they deformation re- tract onto complexes of dimensions 0 and n − 1 , respectively, and by the lemma we can restrict to the bundles over these complexes. Next there is the case that B is an inﬁnite-dimensional CW complex. Since —B; Bn– is n connected, the lemma implies that the same is true of ( E; p−1—Bn–\u0001 . Hence in the commutative diagram at the right the B RH () ) ¤ FH ( ¤\u0000 ¡¡¡¡¡! B RH () ) ¤ FH ( ¤\u0000 EBpH () ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¤ H ( ()) ¤¡¡!Ø¡¡!Ø n n- 1 horizontal maps are isomorphisms below dimension n . Then the fact that the right- hand Ø is an isomorphism, as we have al- ready shown, implies that the left-hand Ø is an isomorphism below dimension n . Since n is arbitrary, this gives the theorem for all CW complexes B . To extend to the case of arbitrary base spaces B we need the notion of a pull- back bundle which is used quite frequently in bundle theory. Given a ﬁber bundle 434 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory p : E!B and a map f : A!B , let f \u0003—E– …f—a; e– 2 A\u0002 E \f \f f —a– … p—e–g , so there is a commutative diagram as at the right, where the two maps from EEf f () ¤ ¡¡¡¡¡! AB p ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!f \u0003—E– are —a; e– , a and —a; e– , e . It is a simple exercise to verify that the projection f \u0003—E–!A is a ﬁber bundle with the same ﬁber as E!B , since a local trivialization of E!B over U ˆ B gives rise to a local trivialization of f \u0003—E–!A over f −1—U– . If f : A!B is a CW approximation to an arbitrary base space B , then f \u0003—E–!E induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups by the ﬁve-lemma applied to the long exact sequences of homotopy groups for the two bundles E!B and f \u0003—E–!A with ﬁber F . Hence f \u0003—E–!E is also an isomorphism on cohomology. The classes cj pull back to classes in H\u0003—f \u0003—E–; R– which still restrict to a basis in each ﬁber, and so the naturality of Ø reduces the theorem for E!B to the case of f \u0003—E–!A . tu Corollary 4D.3. (a) H\u0003—U—n–; Z– ˇ ÓZƒx1;x3; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x2n−1⁄ , the exterior algebra on generators xi of odd dimension i . (b) H\u0003—SU—n–; Z– ˇ ÓZƒx3;x5; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x2n−1⁄ . (c) H\u0003—Sp—n–; Z– ˇ ÓZƒx3;x7; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x4n−1⁄ . This rather simple structure is in marked contrast with the cohomology of O—n– and SO—n– which is considerably more complicated, as shown in x3.D. Proof: For (a), assume inductively that the result holds for U—n − 1– . By consider- ing the bundle U—n − 1–!U—n–!S 2n−1 we see that the pair ( U—n–; U—n − 1–\u0001 is —2n − 2– connected, so Hi—U—n–; Z–!Hi—U—n − 1–; Z– is onto for i \u0014 2n − 3 and the classes x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x2n−3 2 H\u0003—U—n − 1–; Z– given by induction are the restrictions of classes c1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;c2n−3 2 H\u0003—U—n–; Z– . The products of distinct xi ’s form a ba- sis for H\u0003—U—n − 1–; Z– ˇ ÓZƒx1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x2n−3⁄ , and these products are restrictions of the corresponding products of ci ’s, so the Leray–Hirsch theorem applies, yielding H\u0003—U—n–; Z– ˇ H\u0003—U—n − 1–; Z– ⊗ H\u0003—S 2n−1; Z– . In view of the commutativity prop- erty of cup product, this tensor product is the exterior algebra on odd-dimensional generators x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x2n−1 . The same proof works for Sp—n– using the bundle Sp—n − 1–!Sp—n–!S 4n−1 . In the case of SU—n– one uses the bundle SU —n − 1–!SU—n–!S 2n−1 . Since SU —1– is the trivial group, the bundle SU —1–!SU —2–!S 3 shows that SU —2– … S 3 , so the ﬁrst generator is x3 . tu It is illuminating to look more closely at how the homology and cohomology of O—n– , U—n– , and Sp—n– are related to their bundle structures. For U—n– one has the sequence of bundles U 2()U 1() S¡¡! 35 S 1 > U 3() S¡¡! 22 > U n 1() S¡¡!>> ... ... - -n 3 U n() S¡¡!> -n 1 = Cohomology of Fiber Bundles Section 4.D 435 If all these were product bundles, U—n– would be homeomorphic to the product S 1 \u0002 S 3 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 S 2n−1 . In actuality the bundles are nontrivial, but the homology and cohomology of U—n– are the same as for this product of spheres, including the cup product structure. For Sp—n– the situation is quite similar, with the corresponding product of spheres S 3 \u0002 S 7 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 S 4n−1 . For O—n– the corresponding sequence of bundles is O 2()O 1() S¡¡! 1 S 0 > O 3() S¡¡! 2 > O n 1() S¡¡!>> ... ... - -n 2 O n() S¡¡!> -n 1 = The calculations in x3.D show that H\u0003—O—n–; Z2– ˇ H\u0003—S 0 \u0002 S 1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 S n−1; Z2– , but with Z coefﬁcients this no longer holds. Instead, consider the coarser sequence of bundles O 3() () O 1() V¡¡! 3 2 S 0 > O 5()¡¡! 22 > O 2k 1()¡¡!>> ... ... - -k 1 O 2k() S¡¡!> -k 1 = R () )V 5 2 R (V2 R where the last bundle O—2k–!S 2k−1 is omitted if n … 2k − 1 . As we remarked at the end of x3.D in the case of SO—n– , O—n– has the same integral homology and cohomology groups as if these bundles were products, but the cup product structure for O—n– with Z2 coefﬁcients is not the same as in this product. Cohomology of Grassmannians Here is an important application of the Leray–Hirsch theorem, generalizing the calculation of the cohomology rings of projective spaces: Theorem 4D.4. If Gn—C 1– is the Grassmann manifold of n dimensional vector sub- spaces of C1 , then H\u0003—Gn—C 1–; Z– is a polynomial ring Zƒc1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;cn⁄ on generators ci of dimension 2i . Similarly, H\u0003—Gn—R 1–; Z2– is a polynomial ring Z2ƒw1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ on generators wi of dimension i , and H\u0003—Gn—H 1–; Z– ˇ Zƒq1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;qn⁄ with qi of dimension 4i . The plan of the proof is to apply the Leray–Hirsch theorem to a ﬁber bundle F -! E p -----! Gn—C 1– where E has the same cohomology ring as the product of n copies of CP1 , a polynomial ring Zƒx1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn⁄ with each xi 2 dimensional. The induced map p\u0003 : H\u0003—Gn—C 1–; Z–!H\u0003—E; Z– will be injective, and we will show that its image consists of the symmetric polynomials in Zƒx1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn⁄ , the polynomials invariant under permutations of the variables xi . It is a classical theorem in algebra that the symmetric polynomials themselves form a polynomial ring Zƒ˙1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;˙n⁄ where ˙i is a certain symmetric polynomial of degree i , namely the sum of all products of i distinct xj ’s. This gives the result for Gn—C 1– , and the same argument will also apply in the real and quaternionic cases. 436 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Proof: Deﬁne an n ﬂag in C k to be an ordered n tuple of orthogonal 1 dimensional vector subspaces of Ck . Equivalently, an n ﬂag could be deﬁned as a chain of vector subspaces V1 ˆ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ˆ Vn of C k where Vi has dimension i . Why either of these objects should be called a ‘ﬂag’ is not exactly clear, but that is the traditional name. The set of all n ﬂags in Ck forms a subspace Fn—C k– of the product of n copies of CPk−1 . There is a natural ﬁber bundle Fn—C n– ------! Fn—C k– p ------------! Gn—Ck– where p sends an n tuple of orthogonal lines to the n plane it spans. The local triviality property can be veriﬁed just as was done for the analogous Stiefel bundle Vn—C n–!Vn—C k–!Gn—C k– in Example 4.53. The case k …1 is covered by the same argument, and this case will be the bundle F!E!Gn—C 1– alluded to in the para- graph preceding the proof. The ﬁrst step in the proof is to show that H\u0003—Fn—C 1–; Z– ˇ Zƒx1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn⁄ where xi is the pullback of a generator of H2—CP1; Z– under the map Fn—C 1–!CP1 pro- jecting an n ﬂag onto its i th line. This can be seen by considering the ﬁber bundle CP1 ------! Fn—C 1– p ------------! Fn−1—C 1– where p projects an n ﬂag onto the —n−1– ﬂag obtained by ignoring its last line. The local triviality property can be veriﬁed by the argument in Example 4.54. The Leray– Hirsch theorem applies since the powers of xn restrict to a basis for H\u0003—CP1; Z– in the ﬁbers CP1 , each ﬁber being the space of lines in a vector subspace C 1 of the standard C1 . The elements xi for i<n are the pullbacks via p of elements of H\u0003—Fn−1—C 1–; Z– deﬁned in the same way. By induction H\u0003—Fn−1—C1–; Z– is a polynomial ring on these elements. From the Leray–Hirsch theorem we conclude that the products of powers of the xi ’s for 1 \u0014 i \u0014 n form an additive basis for H\u0003—Fn—C 1–; Z– , hence this ring is the polynomial ring on the xi ’s. There is a corresponding result for Fn—C k– , that H\u0003—Fn—C k–; Z– is free with basis the monomials xi1 1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 xin n with ij \u0014 k−j for each j . This is proved in exactly the same way, using induction on n and the ﬁber bundle CPk−n!Fn—C k–!Fn−1—C k– . Thus the cohomology groups of Fn—C k– are isomorphic to those of CPk−1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 CPk−n . After these preliminaries we can start the main argument, using the ﬁber bundle Fn—C n– -! Fn—C 1– p -----! Gn—C 1– . The preceding calculations show that the Leray– Hirsch theorem applies, so H\u0003—Fn—C 1–; Z– is a free module over H\u0003—Gn—C 1–; Z– with basis the monomials xi1 1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 xin n with ij \u0014 n − j for each j . In particular, since 1 is among the basis elements, the homomorphism p\u0003 is injective and its image is a direct summand of H\u0003—Fn—C1–; Z– . It remains to show that the image of p\u0003 is exactly the symmetric polynomials. To show that the image of p\u0003 is contained in the symmetric polynomials, consider a map ˇ : Fn—C 1–!Fn—C 1– permuting the lines in each n ﬂag according to a given Cohomology of Fiber Bundles Section 4.D 437 permutation of the numbers 1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;n . The induced map ˇ \u0003 on H\u0003—Fn—C 1–; Z– ˇ Zƒx1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn⁄ is the corresponding permutation of the variables xi . Since permuting the lines in an n ﬂag has no effect on the n plane they span, we have pˇ … p , hence ˇ \u0003p\u0003 … p\u0003 , which says that polynomials in the image of p\u0003 are invariant under permutations of the variables. As remarked earlier, the symmetric polynomials in Zƒx1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn⁄ form a poly- nomial ring Zƒ˙1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;˙n⁄ where ˙i has degree i . We have shown that the image of p\u0003 is a direct summand, so to show that p\u0003 maps onto the symmetric polynomials it will sufﬁce to show that the graded rings H\u0003—Gn—C 1–; Z– and Zƒ˙1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;˙n⁄ have the same rank in each dimension, where the rank of a ﬁnitely generated free abelian group is the number of Z summands. For a graded free Z module A … L i Ai , deﬁne its Poincar´e series to be the formal power series pA—t– … P i aiti where ai is the rank of Ai , which we assume to be ﬁnite for all i . The basic formula we need is that pA⊗B—t– … pA—t– pB—t– , which is immediate from the deﬁnition of the graded tensor product. In the case at hand all nonzero cohomology is in even dimensions, so let us sim- plify notation by taking Ai to be the 2i dimensional cohomology of the space in question. Since the Poincar´e series of Zƒx⁄ is P i ti … —1 − t– −1 , the Poincar´e series of H\u0003—Fn—C 1–; Z– is —1 − t–−n . For H\u0003—Fn—Cn–; Z– the Poincar´e series is —1 ‡ t–—1 ‡ t ‡ t2– \u0001\u0001\u0001 —1 ‡ t ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ tn−1– … nY i…1 1 − ti 1 − t … —1 − t– −n nY i…1—1 − ti– From the additive isomorphism H\u0003—Fn—C 1–; Z– ˇ H\u0003—Gn—C 1–; Z– ⊗ H\u0003—Fn—C n–; Z– we see that the Poincar´e series p—t– of H\u0003—Gn—C 1–; Z– satisﬁes p—t–—1 − t–−n nY i…1 —1 − ti– … —1 − t– −n and hence p—t– … nY i…1—1 − ti– −1 This is exactly the Poincar´e series of Zƒ˙1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;˙n⁄ since ˙i has degree i . As noted before, this implies that the image of p\u0003 is all the symmetric polynomials. This ﬁnishes the proof for Gn—C 1– . The same arguments apply in the other two cases, using Z2 coefﬁcients throughout in the real case and replacing ‘rank’ by ‘dimension’ for Z2 vector spaces. tu These calculations show that the isomorphism H\u0003—E; R– ˇ H\u0003—B; R– ⊗R H\u0003—F ; R– of the Leray–Hirsch theorem is not generally a ring isomorphism, for if it were, then the polynomial ring H\u0003—Fn—C 1–; Z– would contain a copy of H\u0003—Fn—C n–; Z– as a subring, but in the latter ring some power of every positive-dimensional element is zero since Hk—Fn—C n–; Z– … 0 for sufﬁciently large k . The Gysin Sequence Besides the Leray–Hirsch theorem, which deals with ﬁber bundles that are coho- mologically like products, there is another special class of ﬁber bundles for which an 438 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory elementary analysis of their cohomology structure is possible. These are ﬁber bun- dles S n−1 -! E p -----! B satisfying an orientability hypothesis that will always hold if B is simply-connected or if we take cohomology with Z2 coefﬁcients. For such bundles we will show there is an exact sequence, called the Gysin sequence, \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! Hi−n—B; R– `e-----------------! Hi—B; R– p\u0003 ------------! Hi—E; R– -! Hi−n‡1—B; R– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 where e is a certain ‘Euler class’ in Hn—B; R– . Since Hi—B; R– … 0 for i< 0 , the initial portion of the Gysin sequence gives isomorphisms p\u0003 : Hi—B; R– ˇ-----! Hi—E; R– for i<n − 1 , and the more interesting part of the sequence begins 0 -! Hn−1—B; R– p\u0003 ------------! Hn−1—E; R– -! H0—B; R– `e--------------! Hn—B; R– p\u0003 ------------! Hn—E; R– -! \u0001\u0001\u0001 In the case of a product bundle E … S n−1 \u0002 B there is a section, a map s : B!E with ps … 11 , so the Gysin sequence breaks up into split short exact sequences 0 -! Hi—B; R– p\u0003 ------------! Hi—S n−1 \u0002 B; R– -! Hi−n‡1—B; R– -! 0 which agrees with the K¨unneth formula H\u0003—S n−1 \u0002 B; R– ˇ H\u0003—S n−1; R– ⊗ H\u0003—B; R– . The splitting holds whenever the bundle has a section, even if it is not a product. For example, consider the bundle S n−1!V2—R n‡1– p -----! S n . Points of V2—Rn‡1– are pairs —v1;v2– of orthogonal unit vectors in R n‡1 , and p—v1;v2– … v1 . If we think of v1 as a point of S n and v2 as a unit vector tangent to S n at v1 , then V2—Rn‡1– is exactly the bundle of unit tangent vectors to S n . A section of this bundle is a ﬁeld of unit tangent vectors to S n , and such a vector ﬁeld exists iff n is odd by Theorem 2.28. The fact that the Gysin sequence splits when there is a section then says that V2—R n‡1– has the same cohomology as the product S n−1 \u0002 S n if n is odd, at least when n> 1 so that the base space S n is simply-connected and the orientability hypothesis is satisﬁed. When n is even, the calculations at the end of x3.D show that H\u0003—V2—Rn‡1–; Z– consists of Z ’s in dimensions 0 and 2n − 1 and a Z2 in dimension n . The latter group appears in the Gysin sequence as )) )(( (VSH 2 2 Rn 1+nn H n )(S n H 1 )(S 0H n ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! e== Z= Z= Z 0 hence the Euler class e must be twice a generator of Hn—S n– in the case that n is even. When n is odd it must be zero in order for the Gysin sequence to split. This example illustrates a theorem in differential topology that explains why the Euler class has this name: The Euler class of the unit tangent bundle of a closed orientable smooth n manifold M is equal to the Euler characteristic ˜ —M– times a generator of Hn—M; Z– . Whenever a bundle S n−1!E p -----! B has a section, the Euler class e must be zero from exactness of H0—B– `e------------! Hn—B– p\u0003 ---------! Hn—E– since p\u0003 is injective if there is a section. Thus the Euler class can be viewed as an obstruction to the existence of a section: If the Euler class is nonzero, there can be no section. This qualitative Cohomology of Fiber Bundles Section 4.D 439 statement can be made more precise by bringing in the machinery of obstruction theory, as explained in [Milnor & Stasheff 1974] or [VBKT]. Before deriving the Gysin sequence let us look at some examples of how it can be used to compute cup products. Example 4D.5. Consider a bundle S n−1 -! E p -----! B with E contractible, for exam- ple the bundle S 1!S 1!CP1 or its real or quaternionic analogs. The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the bundle shows that B is —n − 1– connected. Thus if n> 1, B is simply-connected and we have a Gysin sequence for cohomology with Z coefﬁcients. For n … 1 we take Z2 coefﬁcients. If n> 1 then since E is contractible, the Gysin sequence implies that Hi—B; Z– … 0 for 0 <i<n and that `e : Hi—B; Z–!Hi‡n—B; Z– is an isomorphism for i \u0015 0 . It follows that H\u0003—B; Z– is the polynomial ring Zƒe⁄ . When n … 1 the map p\u0003 : Hn−1—B; Z2–!Hn−1—E; Z2– in the Gysin sequence is surjective, so we see that `e : Hi—B; Z2–!Hi‡n—B; Z2– is again an isomorphism for all i \u0015 0 , and hence H\u0003—B; Z2– ˇ Z2ƒe⁄ . Thus the Gysin sequence gives a new derivation of the cup product structure in projective spaces. Also, since polynomial rings Zƒe⁄ are realizable as H\u0003—X; Z– only when e has dimension 2 or 4, as we show in Corollary 4L.10, we can conclude that there exist bundles S n−1!E!B with E contractible only when n is 1, 2, or 4. Example 4D.6. For the Grassmann manifold Gn … Gn—R1– we have ˇ1—Gn– ˇ ˇ0O—n– ˇ Z2 , so the universal cover of Gn gives a bundle S 0! eGn!Gn . One can view eGn as the space of oriented n planes in R 1 , which is obviously a 2 sheeted covering space of Gn , hence the universal cover since it is path-connected, being the quotient Vn—R 1–=SO—n– of the contractible space Vn—R 1– . A portion of the Gysin sequence for the bundle S 0! eGn!Gn is H0—Gn; Z2– `e------------! H1—Gn; Z2– -! H1— eGn; Z2– . This last group is zero since eGn is simply-connected, and H1—Gn; Z2– ˇ Z2 since H\u0003—Gn; Z2– ˇ Z2ƒw1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ as we showed earlier in this section, so e … w1 and the map `e : H\u0003—Gn; Z2–!H\u0003—Gn; Z2– is injective. The Gysin sequence then breaks up into short exact sequences 0!Hi—Gn; Z2– `e------------! Hi‡1—Gn; Z2–!Hi‡1— eGn; Z2–!0, from which it follows that H\u0003— eGn; Z2– is the quotient ring Z2ƒw1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄=—w1– ˇ Z2ƒw2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wn⁄ . Example 4D.7. The complex analog of the bundle in the preceding example is a bundle S 1! eGn—C 1–!Gn—C 1– with eGn—C 1– 2 connected. This can be constructed in the following way. There is a determinant homomorphism U—n–!S 1 with kernel SU—n– , the unitary matrices of determinant 1 , so S 1 is the coset space U—n–=SU—n– , and by restricting the action of U—n– on Vn—C 1– to SU—n– we obtain the second row of the commutative diagram at the right. The )(V )(SU n )(Un n C 1¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! )(Gn C 1 )(GS n C 1)(Vn C 1 ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡!¡!== 1 / second row is a ﬁber bundle by the usual argument of choosing continuously varying orthonormal bases in n planes near a 440 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory given n plane. One sees that the space eGn—C 1– … Vn—C 1–=SU—n– is 2 connected by looking at the relevant portion of the diagram of homotopy groups associated to these two bundles: )(Un¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡!==)¼1()Gn¼2(00 )Gn¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¼1()S¼1 1( » )Gn¼2()G00n¼2( » @ @ ¼ ¼ The second vertical map is an isomorphism since S 1 embeds in U—n– as the subgroup U—1– . Since the boundary map in the upper row is an isomorphism, so also is the boundary map in the lower row, and then exactness implies that eGn is 2 connected. The Gysin sequence for S 1! eGn—C 1–!Gn—C 1– can be analyzed just as in the preceding example. Part of the sequence is H0—Gn; Z– `e------------! H2—Gn; Z– -! H2— eGn; Z– , and this last group is zero since eGn is 2 connected, so e must be a generator of H2—Gn; Z– ˇ Z . Since H\u0003—Gn; Z– is a polynomial algebra Zƒc1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;cn⁄ , we must have e …\u0006c1 , so the map `e : H\u0003—Gn; Z–!H\u0003—Gn; Z– is injective, the Gysin se- quence breaks up into short exact sequences, and H\u0003— eGn; Z– is the quotient ring Zƒc1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;cn⁄=—c1– ˇ Zƒc2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;cn⁄ . The spaces eGn in the last two examples are often denoted BSO—n– and BSU—n– , expressing the fact that they are related to the groups SO—n– and SU—n– via bundles SO—n–!Vn—R 1–!BSO—n– and SU—n–!Vn—C 1–!BSU—n– with contractible total spaces Vn . There is no quaternion analog of BSO—n– and BSU—n– since for n … 2 this would give a space with cohomology ring Zƒx⁄ on an 8 dimensional generator, which is impossible by Corollary 4L.10. Now we turn to the derivation of the Gysin sequence, which follows a rather roundabout route: (1) Deduce a relative version of the Leray–Hirsch theorem from the absolute case. (2) Specialize this to the case of bundles with ﬁber a disk, yielding a basic result called the Thom isomorphism. (3) Show this applies to all orientable disk bundles. (4) Deduce the Gysin sequence by plugging the Thom isomorphism into the long exact sequence of cohomology groups for the pair consisting of a disk bundle and its boundary sphere bundle. (1) A ﬁber bundle pair consists of a ﬁber bundle p : E!B with ﬁber F , together with a subspace E0 ˆ E such that p : E0!B is a bundle with ﬁber a subspace F 0 ˆ F , with local trivializations for E0 obtained by restricting local trivializations for E . For example, if E!B is a bundle with ﬁber Dn and E0 ˆ E is the union of the boundary spheres of the ﬁbers, then —E; E0– is a ﬁber bundle pair since local trivializations of E restrict to local trivializations of E0 , in view of the fact that homeomorphisms from an n disk to an n disk restrict to homeomorphisms between their boundary spheres, boundary and interior points of Dn being distinguished by the local homology groups Hn—Dn;Dn −fxg; Z– . Cohomology of Fiber Bundles Section 4.D 441 Theorem 4D.8. Suppose that —F ; F 0–!—E; E0– p -----! B is a ﬁber bundle pair such that H\u0003—F ; F 0; R– is a free R module, ﬁnitely generated in each dimension. If there exist classes cj 2 H\u0003—E; E0; R– whose restrictions form a basis for H\u0003—F ; F 0; R– in each ﬁber —F ; F 0– , then H\u0003—E; E0; R– , as a module over H\u0003—B; R– , is free with basis fcjg . The module structure is deﬁned just as in the absolute case by bc … p\u0003—b– ` c , but now we use the relative cup product H\u0003—E; R–\u0002 H\u0003—E; E0; R–!H\u0003—E; E0; R– . Proof: Construct a bundle bE!B from E by attaching the mapping cylinder M of p : E0!B to E by identifying the subspaces E0 ˆ E and E0 ˆ M . Thus the ﬁbers bF of bE are obtained from the ﬁbers F by attaching cones CF 0 on the subspaces F 0 ˆ F . Regarding B as the subspace of bE at one end of the mapping cylinder M ,we have H\u0003— bE; M; R– ˇ H\u0003— bE − B; M − B; R– ˇ H\u0003—E; E0; R– via excision and the obvious deformation retraction of bE − B onto E . The long exact sequence of a triple gives H\u0003— bE; M; R– ˇ H\u0003— bE; B; R– since M deformation retracts to B . All these isomorphisms are H\u0003—B; R– module isomorphisms. Since B is a retract of bE via the bundle projection bE!B , we have a splitting H\u0003— bE; R– ˇ H\u0003— bE; B; R–L H\u0003—B; R– as H\u0003—B; R– modules. Let bcj 2 H\u0003— bE; R– correspond to cj 2 H\u0003—E; E0; R– ˇ H\u0003— bE; B; R– in this splitting. The classes bcj together with 1 restrict to a basis for H\u0003— bF ; R– in each ﬁber bF … F [ CF 0 , so the absolute form of the Leray–Hirsch theorem implies that H\u0003— bE; R– is a free H\u0003—B; R– module with basis f1; bcjg . It follows that fcjg is a basis for the free H\u0003—B; R– module H\u0003—E; E0; R– . tu (2) Now we specialize to the case of a ﬁber bundle pair —Dn;S n−1– -! —E; E0– p -----! B . An element c 2 H n—E; E0; R– whose restriction to each ﬁber —Dn;S n−1– is a gener- ator of Hn—Dn;S n−1; R– ˇ R is called a Thom class for the bundle. We are mainly interested in the cases R … Z and Z2 , but R could be any commutative ring with identity, in which case a ‘generator’ is an element with a multiplicative inverse, so all elements of R are multiples of the generator. A Thom class with Z coefﬁcients gives rise to a Thom class with any other coefﬁcient ring R under the homomorphism Hn—E; E0; Z–!Hn—E; E0; R– induced by the homomorphism Z!R sending 1 to the identity element of R . Corollary 4D.9. If the disk bundle —Dn;S n−1– -! —E; E0– p -----! B has a Thom class c 2 Hn—E; E0; R– , then the map Ø : Hi—B; R–!Hi‡n—E; E0; R– , Ø—b– … p\u0003—b– ` c ,is an isomorphism for all i \u0015 0 , and Hi—E; E0; R– … 0 for i<n . tu The isomorphism Ø is called the Thom isomorphism. The corollary can be made into a statement about absolute cohomology by deﬁning the Thom space T—E– to be the quotient E=E0 . Each disk ﬁber Dn of E becomes a sphere S n in T—E– , and all these spheres coming from different ﬁbers are disjoint except for the common base- point x0 … E0=E0 . A Thom class can be regarded as an element of Hn—T —E–; x0; R– ˇ 442 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Hn—T —E–; R– that restricts to a generator of Hn—S n; R– in each ‘ﬁber’ S n in T—E– , and the Thom isomorphism becomes Hi—B; R– ˇ eHn‡i—T —E–; R– . (3) The major remaining step in the derivation of the Gysin sequence is to relate the existence of a Thom class for a disk bundle Dn!E!B to a notion of orientability of the bundle. First we deﬁne orientability for a sphere bundle S n−1!E0!B .In the proof of Proposition 4.61 we described a procedure for lifting paths γ in B to homotopy equivalences Lγ between the ﬁbers above the endpoints of γ . We did this for ﬁbrations rather than ﬁber bundles, but the method applies equally well to ﬁber bundles whose ﬁber is a CW complex since the homotopy lifting property was used only for the ﬁber and for the product of the ﬁber with I . In the case of a sphere bundle S n−1!E0!B ,if γ is a loop in B then Lγ is a homotopy equivalence from the ﬁber S n−1 over the basepoint of γ to itself, and we deﬁne the sphere bundle to be orientable if Lγ induces the identity map on Hn−1—S n−1; Z– for each loop γ in B . For example, the Klein bottle, regarded as a bundle over S 1 with ﬁber S 1 ,is nonorientable since as we follow a path looping once around the base circle, the cor- responding ﬁber circles sweep out the full Klein bottle, ending up where they started but with orientation reversed. The same reasoning shows that the torus, viewed as a circle bundle over S 1 , is orientable. More generally, any sphere bundle that is a prod- uct is orientable since the maps Lγ can be taken to be the identity for all loops γ . Also, sphere bundles over simply-connected base spaces are orientable since γ ' \u0011 implies Lγ ' L\u0011 , hence all Lγ ’s are homotopic to the identity when all loops γ are nullhomotopic. One could deﬁne orientability for a disk bundle Dn!E!B by relativizing the previous deﬁnition, constructing lifts Lγ which are homotopy equivalences of the ﬁber pairs —Dn;S n−1– . However, since Hn—Dn;S n−1; Z– is canonically isomorphic to Hn−1—S n−1; Z– via the coboundary map in the long exact sequence of the pair, it is simpler and amounts to the same thing just to deﬁne E to be orientable if its boundary sphere subbundle E0 is orientable. Theorem 4D.10. Every disk bundle has a Thom class with Z2 coefﬁcients, and ori- entable disk bundles have Thom classes with Z coefﬁcients. An exercise at the end of the section is to show that the converse of the last state- ment is also true: A disk bundle is orientable if it has a Thom class with Z coefﬁcients. Proof: The case of a non-CW base space B reduces to the CW case by pulling back over a CW approximation to B , as in the Leray–Hirsch theorem, applying the ﬁve-lemma to say that the pullback bundle has isomorphic homotopy groups, hence isomorphic absolute and relative cohomology groups. From the deﬁnition of the pullback bundle it is immediate that the pullback of an orientable sphere bundle is orientable. There is also no harm in assuming the base CW complex B is connected. We will show: Cohomology of Fiber Bundles Section 4.D 443 —\u0003– If the disk bundle Dn!E!B is orientable and B is a connected CW complex, then the restriction map Hi—E; E0; Z–!Hi—Dn x ;S n−1 x ; Z– is an isomorphism for all ﬁbers Dn x , x 2 B , and for all i \u0014 n . For Z2 coefﬁcients we will see that —\u0003– holds without any orientability hypothesis. Hence with either Z or Z2 coefﬁcients, a generator of Hn—E; E0– ˇ Hn—Dn x ;S n−1 x – is a Thom class. If the disk bundle Dn!E!B is orientable, then if we choose an isomorphism Hn—Dn x ;S n−1 x ; Z– ˇ Z for one ﬁber Dn x , this determines such isomorphisms for all ﬁbers by composing with the isomorphisms L \u0003 γ , which depend only on the endpoints of γ . Having made such a choice, then if —\u0003– is true, we have a preferred isomorphism Hn—E; E0; Z– ˇ Z which restricts to the chosen isomorphism Hn—Dn x ;S n−1 x ; Z– ˇ Z for each ﬁber. This is because for a path γ from x to y , the inclusion —Dn x ;S n−1 x –>—E; E0– is homotopic to the composition of Lγ with the inclusion —Dn y ;S n−1 y – > —E; E0– .We will use this preferred isomorphism Hn—E; E0; Z– ˇ Z in the inductive proof of —\u0003– given below. In the case of Z2 coefﬁcients, there can be only one isomorphism of a group with Z2 so no choices are necessary and orientability is irrelevant. We will prove —\u0003– in the Z coefﬁcient case, leaving it to the reader to replace all Z ’s in the proof by Z2 ’s to obtain a proof in the Z2 case. Suppose ﬁrst that the CW complex B has ﬁnite dimension k . Let U ˆ B be the subspace obtained by deleting one point from the interior of each k cell of B , and let V ˆ B be the union of the open k cells. Thus B … U [ V . For a subspace A ˆ B let EA!A and E0 A!A be the disk and sphere bundles obtained by taking the subspaces of E and E0 projecting to A . Consider the following portion of a Mayer–Vietoris sequence, with Z coefﬁcients implicit from now on: Hn—E; E0– -! Hn—EU ;E0 U –L Hn—EV ;E0 V – Ù------------! Hn—EU \\V ;E0 U \\V – The ﬁrst map is injective since the preceding term in the sequence is zero by induction on k , since U \\ V deformation retracts onto a disjoint union of —k − 1– spheres and we can apply Lemma 4D.2 to replace EU \\V by the part of E over this union of —k − 1– spheres. By exactness we then have an isomorphism Hn—E; E0– ˇ Ker Ù . Similarly, by Lemma 4D.2 and induction each of the terms Hn—EU ;E0 U – , Hn—EV ;E0 V – , and Hn—EU \\V ;E0 U \\V – is a product of Z ’s, with one Z factor for each component of the spaces involved, projection onto the Z factor being given by restriction to any ﬁber in the component. Elements of Ker Ù are pairs —\u000b; \f– 2 Hn—EU ;E0 U –L Hn—EV ;E0 V – having the same restriction to Hn—EU \\V ;E0 U \\V – . Since B is connected, this means that all the Z coordinates of \u000b and \f in the previous direct product decompositions must be equal, since between any two components of U or V one can interpolate a ﬁnite sequence of components of U and V alternately, each component in the sequence having nontrivial intersection with its neighbors. Thus Ker Ù is a copy of Z , with restriction to a ﬁber being the isomorphism H n—E; E0– ˇ Z . 444 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory To ﬁnish proving —\u0003– for ﬁnite-dimensional B it remains to see that Hi—E; E0– … 0 for i<n , but this follows immediately by looking at an earlier stage of the Mayer– Vietoris sequence, where the two terms adjacent to Hi—E; E0– vanish by induction. Proving —\u0003– for an inﬁnite-dimensional CW complex B reduces to the ﬁnite- dimensional case as in the Leray–Hirsch theorem since we are only interested in co- homology in a ﬁnite range of dimensions. tu (4) Now we can derive the Gysin sequence for a sphere bundle S n−1!E p -----! B . Con- sider the mapping cylinder Mp , which is a disk bundle Dn!Mp p -----! B with E as its boundary sphere bundle. Assuming that a Thom class c 2 Hn—Mp;E; R– exists, as is the case if E is orientable or if R … Z2 , then the long exact sequence of cohomology groups for the pair —Mp;E– gives the ﬁrst row of the following commutative diagram, with R coefﬁcients implicit: MEH ()¡¡! , H ()¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!... ... ¡¡! ¡¡!Ø¡¡!Ø ii EH () ¡¡¡¡¡! i p MEH (), i 1 pMp j + + BH ()¡¡¡! H ()¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!... ... i n i EH () ¡¡¡¡¡! i B pe- BH () i n 1- ¤ ¤ p¤==¼¼¼ The maps Ø are the Thom isomorphism, and the vertical map p\u0003 is an isomorphism since Mp deformation retracts onto B . The Euler class e 2 Hn—B; R– is deﬁned to be —p\u0003–−1j\u0003—c– , c being a Thom class. The square containing the map `e commutes since for b 2 Hi−n—B; R– we have j\u0003Ø—b– … j\u0003—p\u0003—b– ` c– … p\u0003—b– ` j\u0003—c– , which equals p\u0003—b ` e– … p\u0003—b– ` p\u0003—e– since p\u0003—e– … j\u0003—c– . Another way of deﬁning e is as the class corresponding to c ` c under the Thom isomorphism, since Ø—e– … p\u0003—e– ` c … j\u0003—c– ` c … c ` c . Finally, the lower row of the diagram is by deﬁnition the Gysin sequence. tu To conclude this section we will use the following rather specialized application of the Gysin sequence to compute a few more examples of spaces with polynomial cohomology. Proposition 4D.11. Suppose that S 2k−1 -! E p -----! B is an orientable sphere bundle such that H\u0003—E; R– is a polynomial ring Rƒx1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x`⁄ on even-dimensional genera- tors xi . Then H\u0003—B; R– … Rƒy1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`;e⁄ where e is the Euler class of the bundle and p\u0003—yi– … xi for each i . Proof: Consider the three terms Hi—B; R– `e------------! Hi‡2k—B; R– -----! Hi‡2k—E; R– of the Gysin sequence. If i is odd, the third term is zero since E has no odd-dimensional cohomology. Hence the map `e is surjective, and by induction on dimension this implies that H\u0003—B; R– is zero in odd dimensions. This means the Gysin sequence reduces to short exact sequences 0 -! H2i—B; R– `e-----------------! H2i‡2k—B; R– p\u0003 ------------! H2i‡2k—E; R– -! 0 Cohomology of Fiber Bundles Section 4.D 445 Since p\u0003 is surjective, we can choose elements yj 2 H\u0003—B; R– with p\u0003—yj– … xj .It remains to check that H\u0003—B; R– … Rƒy1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`;e⁄ , which is elementary algebra: Given b 2 H\u0003—B; R– , p\u0003—b– must be a polynomial f—x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x`– ,so b − f—y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`– is in the kernel of p\u0003 and exactness gives an equation b − f—y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`– … b0 ` e for some b0 2 H\u0003—B; R– . Since b0 has lower dimension than b , we may assume by induction that b0 is a polynomial in y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`;e . Hence b … f—y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`– ‡ b0 ` e is also a polyno- mial in y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`;e . Thus the natural map Rƒy1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`;e⁄!H\u0003—B; R– is surjective. To see that it is injective, suppose there is a polynomial relation f—y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`;e– … 0in H\u0003—B; R– . Applying p\u0003 , we get f—x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x`; 0– … 0 since p\u0003—yi– … xi and p\u0003—e– … 0 from the short exact sequence. The relation f—x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x`; 0– … 0 takes place in the polynomial ring Rƒx1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x`⁄ ,so f—y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`; 0– … 0in Rƒy1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`;e⁄ , hence f—y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`;e– must be divisible by e , say f … ge for some polynomial g . The relation f—y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`;e– … 0in H\u0003—B; R– then has the form g—y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`;e– ` e … 0. Since `e is injective, this gives a polynomial relation g—y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;y`;e– … 0 with g hav- ing lower degree than f . By induction we deduce that g must be the zero polynomial, hence also f . tu Example 4D.12. Let us apply this to give another proof that H\u0003—Gn—C 1–; Z– is a polynomial ring Zƒc1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;cn⁄ with jcij… 2i . We use two ﬁber bundles: S 2n−1 -! E -! Gn—C 1–S 1 -! E -! Gn−1—C 1– The total space E in both cases is the space of pairs —P ; v– where P is an n plane in C1 and v is a unit vector in P . In the ﬁrst bundle the map E!Gn—C 1– is —P ; v–, P , with ﬁber S 2n−1 , and for the second bundle the map E!Gn−1—C 1– sends —P ; v– to the —n − 1– plane in P orthogonal to v , with ﬁber S 1 consisting of all the unit vectors in C1 orthogonal to a given —n−1– plane. Local triviality for the two bundles is veriﬁed in the usual way. Since S 1 is contractible, the map E!Gn−1—C 1– induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups, hence also on all cohomology groups. By induction on n we then have H\u0003—E; Z– ˇ Zƒc1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;cn−1⁄ . The ﬁrst bundle is orientable since Gn—C 1– is simply-connected, so the corollary gives H\u0003—Gn—C 1–; Z– ˇ Zƒc1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;cn⁄ with cn … e . The same argument works in the quaternionic case. For a version of this argument in the real case see x3.3 of [VBKT]. Before giving our next example, let us observe that the Gysin sequence with a ﬁxed coefﬁcient ring R is valid for any orientable ﬁber bundle F -! E p¨ -----! B whose ﬁber is a CW complex F with H\u0003—F ; R– ˇ H\u0003—S n−1; R– . Orientability is deﬁned just as before in terms of induced maps L\u0003 γ : Hn−1—F ; R–!Hn−1—F ; R– . No changes are needed in the derivation of the Gysin sequence to get this more general case, if the associated ‘disk’ bundle is again taken to be the mapping cylinder CF!Mp!B . Example 4D.13. We have computed the cohomology of eGn—R 1– with Z2 coefﬁcients, ﬁnding it to be a polynomial ring on generators in dimensions 2 through n , and now 446 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory we compute the cohomology with Zp coefﬁcients for p an odd prime. The answer will again be a polynomial algebra, but this time on even-dimensional generators, depending on the parity of n . Consider ﬁrst the case that n is odd, say n … 2k ‡ 1. There are two ﬁber bundles V2—R 2k‡1– -! E -! eG2k‡1—R 1–V2—R 1– -! E -! eG2k−1—R 1– where E is the space of triples —P ; v1;v2– with P an oriented —2k ‡ 1– plane in R 1 and v1 and v2 two orthogonal unit vectors in P . The projection map in the ﬁrst bundle is —P ; v1;v2– , P , and for the second bundle the projection sends —P ; v1;v2– to the oriented —2k − 1– plane in P orthogonal to v1 and v2 , with the orientation speciﬁed by saying for example that v1;v2 followed by a positively oriented basis for the orthogonal —2k − 1– plane is a positively oriented basis for P . Both bundles are orientable since their base spaces eGn—R 1– are simply-connected, from the bundle SO—n–!Vn—R 1–! eGn—R1– . The ﬁber V2—R 1– of the second bundle is contractible, so E has the same coho- mology as eG2k−1—R 1– . The ﬁber of the ﬁrst bundle has the same Zp cohomology as S 4k−1 if p is odd, by the calculation at the end of x3.D. So if we assume inductively that H\u0003— eG2k−1—R1–; Zp– ˇ Zpƒp1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;pk−1⁄ with jpij… 4i , then Proposition 4D.11 above implies that H\u0003— eG2k‡1—R 1–; Zp– ˇ Zpƒp1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;pk⁄ where pk … e has dimension 4k . The induction can start with eG1—R 1– which is just S 1 since an oriented line in R1 contains a unique unit vector in the positive direction. To handle the case of eGn—R 1– with n … 2k even, we proceed just as in Exam- ple 4D.12, considering the bundles S 2k−1 -! E -! eG2k—R 1–S 1 -! E -! eG2k−1—R 1– By the case n odd we have H\u0003— eG2k−1—R 1–; Zp– ˇ Zpƒp1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;pk−1⁄ with jpij… 4i ,so the corollary implies that H\u0003— eG2k—R 1–; Zp– is a polynomial ring on these generators and also a generator in dimension 2k . Summarizing, for p an odd prime we have shown: H\u0003— eG2k‡1—R 1–; Zp– ˇ Zpƒp1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;pk⁄; jpij… 4i H\u0003— eG2k—R 1–; Zp– ˇ Zpƒp1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;pk−1;e⁄; jpij… 4i, jej… 2k The same result holds also with Q coefﬁcients. In fact, our proof applies for any coefﬁcient ring in which 2 has a multiplicative inverse, since all that is needed is that H\u0003—V2—R2k‡1–; R– ˇ H\u0003—S 4k−1; R– . For a calculation of the cohomology of eGn—R 1– with Z coefﬁcients, see [VBKT]. It turns out that all torsion elements have order 2, and modulo this torsion the integral cohomology is again a polynomial ring on the generators pi and e . Similar results hold also for the cohomology of the unoriented Grassmann manifold Gn—R 1– , but with the generator e replaced by pk when n … 2k . Cohomology of Fiber Bundles Section 4.D 447 Exercises 1. By Exercise 35 in x4.2 there is a bundle S 2!CP3!S 4 . Let S 2!Ek!S 4 be the pullback of this bundle via a degree k map S 4!S 4 , k> 1 . Use the Leray-Hirsch theorem to show that H\u0003—Ek; Z– is additively isomorphic to H\u0003—CP3; Z– but has a different cup product structure in which the square of a generator of H2—Ek; Z– is k times a generator of H4—Ek; Z– . 2. Apply the Leray–Hirsch theorem to the bundle S 1!S 1=Zp!CP1 to compute H\u0003—K—Zp; 1–; Zp– from H\u0003—CP1; Zp– . 3. Use the Leray–Hirsch theorem as in Corollary 4D.3 to compute H\u0003—Vn—C k–; Z– ˇ ÓZƒx2k−2n‡1;x2k−2n‡3; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x2k−1⁄ and similarly in the quaternionic case. 4. For the ﬂag space Fn—C n– show that H\u0003—Fn—C n–; Z– ˇ Zƒx1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn⁄=—˙1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;˙n– where ˙i is the i th elementary symmetric polynomial. 5. Use the Gysin sequence to show that for a ﬁber bundle S k!S m p -----! S n we must have k … n − 1 and m … 2n − 1 . Then use the Thom isomorphism to show that the Hopf invariant of p must be \u00061 . [Hence n … 1; 2; 4; 8 by Adams’ theorem.] 6. Show that if M is a manifold of dimension 2n for which there exists a ﬁber bundle S 1!S 2n‡1!M , then M is simply-connected and H\u0003—M; Z– ˇ H\u0003—CPn; Z– as rings. Conversely, if M is simply-connected and H\u0003—M; Z– ˇ H\u0003—CPn; Z– as rings, show there is a bundle S 1!E!M where E ' S 2n‡1 . [When n> 1 there are examples where M is not homeomorphic to CPn .] 7. Show that if a disk bundle Dn!E!B has a Thom class with Z coefﬁcients, then it is orientable. 8.If E is the product bundle B \u0002 Dn with B a CW complex, show that the Thom space T—E– is homotopy equivalent to the n fold reduced suspension Ö nB , and that the Thom isomorphism specializes to the suspension isomorphism Hi—B; R– ˇ eHn‡i—Ö nB; R– given by the reduced cross product in x3.2. 9. Show that the inclusion T n > U—n– of the n torus of diagonal matrices is homo- topic to the map T n!U—1– > U—n– sending an n tuple of unit complex numbers —z1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;zn– to the 1\u0002 1 matrix —z1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 zn– . Do the same for the diagonal subgroup of Sp—n– . [Hint: Diagonal matrices in U—n– are compositions of scalar multiplication in n lines in Cn , and CPn−1 is connected.] 10. Fill in the details of the following argument to show that every n\u0002 n matrix A with entries in H has an eigenvalue in H . (The usual argument over C involv- ing roots of the characteristic polynomial does not work due to the lack of a good quaternionic determinant function.) For t 2 ƒ0; 1⁄ and \u0015 2 S3 ˆ H , consider the matrix t\u0015I ‡ —1 − t–A .If A has no eigenvalues, this is invertible for all t . Thus the map S 3!GLn—H– , \u0015 , \u0015I , is nullhomotopic. But by the preceding problem and Exercise 10(b) in x3.C, this map represents n times a generator of ˇ3GLn—H– . 448 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory In Theorem 4.58 in x4.3 we showed that Ú spectra deﬁne cohomology theories, and now we will prove the converse statement that all cohomology theories on the CW category arise in this way from Ú spectra. Theorem 4E.1. Every reduced cohomology theory on the category of basepointed CW complexes and basepoint-preserving maps has the form h n—X– …hX; Kni for some Ú spectrum fKng . We will also see that the spaces Kn are unique up to homotopy equivalence. This theorem gives another proof that ordinary cohomology is representable as maps into Eilenberg–MacLane spaces, since for the spaces Kn in an Ú spectrum rep- resenting eH\u0003—−; G– we have ˇi—Kn– …hS i;Kni… eHn—S i; R– ,so Kn is a K—G; n– . Before getting into the proof of the theorem let us observe that coﬁbration se- quences, as constructed in x4.3, allow us to recast the deﬁnition of a reduced coho- mology theory in a slightly more concise form: A reduced cohomology theory on the category C whose objects are CW complexes with a chosen basepoint 0 cell and whose morphisms are basepoint-preserving maps is a sequence of functors hn , n 2 Z , from C to abelian groups, together with natural isomorphisms h n—X– ˇ h n‡1—ÖX– for all X in C , such that the following axioms hold for each h n : (i) If f ' g : X!Y in the basepointed sense, then f \u0003 … g\u0003 : h n—Y –!h n—X– . (ii) For each inclusion A> X in C the sequence h n—X=A–!h n—X–!h n—A– is exact. (iii) For a wedge sum X … W \u000b X\u000b with inclusions i\u000b : X\u000b > X , the product map Q \u000b i \u0003 \u000b : h n—X–!Q \u000b hn—X\u000b– is an isomorphism. To see that these axioms sufﬁce to deﬁne a cohomology theory, the main thing to note is that the coﬁbration sequence A!X!X=A!ÖA! \u0001\u0001\u0001 allows us to construct the long exact sequence of a pair, just as we did in the case of the functors h n—X– … hX; Kni . In the converse direction, if we have natural long exact sequences of pairs, then by applying these to pairs of the form —CX; X– we get natural isomorphisms hn—X– ˇ hn‡1—ÖX– . Note that these natural isomorphisms coming from coboundary maps of pairs —CX; X– uniquely determine the coboundary maps for all pairs —X; A– via the diagram at the right, where the maps from Ah () n h n 1() + CA/A h n 1() + CX/A h n 1() + X/A¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¼ h n—A– are coboundary maps of pairs and the dia- gram commutes by naturality of these coboundary maps. The isomorphism comes from a deforma- tion retraction of CX onto CA . It is easy to check that these processes for converting one deﬁnition of a cohomology theory into the other are inverses of each other. Most of the work in representing cohomology theories by Ú spectra will be in realizing a single functor hn of a cohomology theory as h−;Kni for some space Kn . The Brown Representability Theorem Section 4.E 449 So let us consider what properties the functor h—X– …hX; Ki has, where K is a ﬁxed space with basepoint. First of all, it is a contravariant functor from the category of basepointed CW complexes to the category of pointed sets, that is, sets with a distinguished element, the homotopy class of the constant map in the present case. Morphisms in the category of pointed sets are maps preserving the distinguished element. We have already seen in x4.3 that h—X– satisﬁes the three axioms (i)–(iii). A further property is the following Mayer–Vietoris axiom: Suppose the CW complex X is the union of subcomplexes A and B containing the basepoint. Then if a 2 h—A– and b 2 h—B– restrict to the same element of h—A \\ B– , there exists an element x 2 h—X– whose restrictions to A and B are the given elements a and b . Here and in what follows we use the term ‘restriction’ to mean the map induced by inclusion. In the case that h—X– …hX; Ki , this axiom is an immediate consequence of the homotopy extension property. The functors h n in any cohomology theory also satisfy this axiom since there are Mayer–Vietoris exact sequences in any cohomology theory, as we observed in x2.3 in the analogous setting of homology theories. Theorem 4E.2. If h is a contravariant functor from the category of connected base- pointed CW complexes to the category of pointed sets, satisfying the homotopy ax- iom (i), the Mayer–Vietoris axiom, and the wedge axiom (iii), then there exists a connected CW complex K and an element u 2 h—K– such that the transformation Tu : hX; Ki!h—X– , Tu—f – … f \u0003—u– , is a bijection for all X . Such a pair —K; u– is called universal for the functor h . It is automatic from the deﬁnition that the space K in a universal pair —K; u– is unique up to homo- topy equivalence. For if —K0;u 0– is also universal for h , then, using the notation f : —K; u–!—K0;u 0– to mean f : K!K0 with f \u0003—u 0– … u , universality implies that there are maps f : —K; u–!—K0;u 0– and g : —K0;u 0–!—K; u– that are unique up to ho- motopy. Likewise the compositions gf : —K; u–!—K; u– and fg : —K0;u 0–!—K0;u 0– are unique up to homotopy, hence are homotopic to the identity maps. Before starting the proof of this theorem we make two preliminary comments on the axioms. (1) The wedge axiom implies that h—point – is trivial. To see this, just use the fact that for any X we have X _ point … X , so the map h—X–\u0002 h—point –!h—X– induced by inclusion of the ﬁrst summand is a bijection, but this map is the projection —a; b–,a , hence h—point – must have only one element. (2) Axioms (i), (iii), and the Mayer–Vietoris axiom imply axiom (ii). Namely, (ii) is equiv- alent to exactness of h—A– h—X– h—X [ CA– , where CA is the reduced cone since we are in the basepointed category. The inclusion Im ˆ Ker holds since the composi- tion A!X [ CA is nullhomotopic, so the induced map factors through h—point – … 0. 450 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory To obtain the opposite inclusion Ker ˆ Im , decompose X [ CA into two subspaces Y and Z by cutting along a copy of A halfway up the cone CA ,so Y is a smaller copy of CA and Z is the reduced mapping cylinder of the inclusion A > X . Given an element x 2 h—X– , this extends to an element z 2 h—Z– since Z deformation retracts to X .If x restricts to the trivial element of h—A– , then z restricts to the trivial element of h—Y \\ Z– . The latter element extends to the trivial element of h—Y – , so the Mayer–Vietoris axiom implies there is an element of h—X [ CA– restricting to z in h—Z– and hence to x in h—X– . The bulk of the proof of the theorem will be contained in two lemmas. To state the ﬁrst, consider pairs —K; u– with K a basepointed connected CW complex and u 2 h—K– , where h satisﬁes the hypotheses of the theorem. Call such a pair —K; u– n universal if the map Tu : ˇi—K–!h—S i– , Tu—f – … f \u0003—u– , is surjective for i \u0014 n and has trivial kernel for i<n . Note that having a trivial kernel may not be the same as being injective since we are not dealing with homomorphisms of groups here. Call —K; u– ˇ\u0003 universal if it is n universal for all n . Lemma 4E.3. Given any pair —Z; z– with Z a connected CW complex and z 2 h—Z– , there exists a ˇ\u0003 universal pair —K; u– with Z a subcomplex of K and u jj Z … z . Proof: We construct K from Z by an inductive process of attaching cells. To begin, let K1 … Z W \u000b S 1 \u000b where \u000b ranges over the elements of h—S 1– . By the wedge axiom there exists u1 2 h—K1– with u1 jj Z … z and u1 jj S 1 \u000b … \u000b ,so —K1;u1– is 1 universal. For the inductive step, suppose we have already constructed —Kn;un– with un n universal, Z ˆ Kn , and un jj Z … z . Represent each element \u000b in the kernel of Tun : ˇn—Kn–!h—S n– by a map f\u000b : S n!Kn . Let f … W \u000b f\u000b : W \u000b S n \u000b!Kn . The reduced mapping cylinder Mf deformation retracts to Kn , so we can regard un as an element of h—Mf – , and this element restricts to the trivial element of h—W \u000b S n \u000b – by the deﬁnition of f . The exactness property of h then implies that for the reduced mapping cone Cf … Mf = W \u000b S n \u000b there is an element w 2 h—Cf – restricting to un on Kn . Note that Cf is obtained from Kn by attaching cells en‡1 \u000b by the maps f\u000b . To ﬁnish the construction of Kn‡1 , set Kn‡1 … Cf W \f S n‡1 \f where \f ranges over h—S n‡1– . By the wedge axiom again, there exists un‡1 2 h—Kn‡1– restricting to w on Cf and \f on S n‡1 \f . To see that —Kn‡1;un‡1– is —n ‡ 1– universal, consider the commutative diagram at the right. Since Kn‡1 is obtained from Kn by attaching K n 1+ +u n 1 K¼in() Sh i () ¼i () ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡! Tu n T —n ‡ 1– cells, the upper map is an isomorphism for i<n and a surjection for i … n . By induction the map Tun has trivial kernel for i<n and is surjective for i \u0014 n ,sothe same is true for Tun‡1 . The kernel of Tun‡1 is trivial for i … n since an element of this kernel pulls back to Ker Tn ˆ ˇn—Kn– , by surjectivity of the upper map when i … n , and we attached cells to Kn by maps representing all elements of Ker Tn . And lastly, Tun‡1 is surjective for i … n ‡ 1 by construction. The Brown Representability Theorem Section 4.E 451 Now let K … S n Kn . We apply a mapping telescope argument as in the proofs of Lemma 2.34 and Theorem 3F.8 to show there is an element u 2 h—K– restricting to un on Kn , for all n . The mapping telescope of the inclusions K1 > K2 > \u0001\u0001\u0001 is the subcomplex T … Si Ki \u0002 ƒi; i ‡ 1⁄ of K \u0002 ƒ1; 1– . We take ‘ \u0002 ’ to be the reduced product here, with basepoint \u0002 interval collapsed to a point. The natural projection T!K is a homotopy equivalence since K \u0002 ƒ1; 1– deformation retracts onto T , as we showed in the proof of Lemma 2.34. Let A ˆ T be the union of the subcomplexes Ki \u0002 ƒi; i‡1⁄ for i odd and let B be the corresponding union for i even. Thus A [ B … T , A \\ B … W i Ki , A ' W i K2i−1 , and B ' W i K2i . By the wedge axiom there exist a 2 h—A– and b 2 h—B– restricting to ui on each Ki . Then using the fact that ui‡1 jj Ki … ui , the Mayer–Vietoris axiom implies that a and b are the restrictions of an element t 2 h—T – . Under the isomorphism h—T – ˇ h—K– , t corresponds to an element u 2 h—K– restricting to un on Kn for all n . To verify that —K; u– is ˇ\u0003 universal we use the com- mutative diagram at the right. For n>i ‡ 1 the upper K¼in() Sh i () K¼i () ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡! Tu n Tumap is an isomorphism and Tun is surjective with trivial kernel, so the same is true of Tu . tu Lemma 4E.4. Let —K; u– be a ˇ\u0003 universal pair and let —X; A– be a basepointed CW pair. Then for each x 2 h—X– and each map f : A!K with f \u0003—u– … x jj A there exists a map g : X!K extending f with g\u0003—u– … x . Schematically, this is saying that the diagonal arrow in the diagram at the right always exists, where the map i is inclusion. ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! aA(), uK(), xX(),¡¡¡! f g i Proof: Replacing K by the reduced mapping cylinder of f reduces us to the case that f is the inclusion of a subcomplex. Let Z be the union of X and K with the two copies of A identiﬁed. By the Mayer–Vietoris axiom, there exists z 2 h—Z– with z jj X … x and z jj K … u . By the previous lemma, we can embed —Z; z– in a ˇ\u0003 universal pair —K0;u 0– . The inclusion —K; u– > —K0;u 0– induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups since both u and u0 are ˇ\u0003 universal, so K0 deformation retracts onto K . This deformation retraction induces a homotopy rel A of the inclusion X > K0 to a map g : X!K . The relation g\u0003—u– … x holds since u 0 jj K … u and u 0 jj X … x . tu Proof of Theorem 4E.2: It sufﬁces to show that a ˇ\u0003 universal pair —K; u– is univer- sal. Applying the preceding lemma with A a point shows that Tu : hX; Ki!h—X– is surjective. To show injectivity, suppose Tu—f0– … Tu—f1– , that is, f \u0003 0 —u– … f \u0003 1 —u– .We apply the preceding lemma with —X \u0002 I; X \u0002 @I– playing the role of —X; A– , using the maps f0 and f1 on X \u0002 @I and taking x to be p\u0003f \u0003 0 —u– … p\u0003f \u0003 1 —u– where p is the projection X \u0002 I!X . Here X \u0002 I should be the reduced product, with basepoint \u0002 I collapsed to a point. The lemma then gives a homotopy from f0 to f1 . tu 452 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Proof of Theorem 4E.1: Since suspension is an isomorphism in any reduced coho- mology theory, and the suspension of any CW complex is connected, it sufﬁces to restrict attention to connected CW complexes. Each functor h n satisﬁes the homo- topy, wedge, and Mayer–Vietoris axioms, as we noted earlier, so the preceding theorem gives CW complexes Kn with h n—X– …hX; Kni . It remains to show that the natu- ral isomorphisms hn—X– ˇ h n‡1—ÖX– correspond to weak homotopy equivalences Kn!ÚKn‡1 . The natural isomorphism h n—X– ˇ h n‡1—ÖX– corresponds to a nat- ural bijection hX; KniˇhÖX; Kn‡1i…hX; ÚKn‡1i which we call Ø . The naturality of this bijection gives, for any map f : X!Kn ,a commutative diagram as at the right. Let \"n … K nK n ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ,hi KK n ,hi K nX,hi n 1+\u0000 KX,hin 1+\u0000¡¡¡!Ø¡¡¡!Ø f ¤ f ¤Ø—11– : Kn!ÚKn‡1 . Then using commutativity we have Ø—f – … Øf \u0003—11– … f \u0003Ø—11– … f \u0003—\"n– … \"nf , which says that the map Ø : hX; Kni!hX; ÚKn‡1i is composition with \"n . Since Ø is a bijection, if we take X to be S i , we see that \"n induces an isomorphism on ˇi for all i ,so \"n is a weak homotopy equivalence and we have an Ú spectrum. There is one ﬁnal thing to verify, that the bijection h n—X– …hX; Kni is a group isomorphism, where hX; Kni has the group structure that comes from identifying it with hX; ÚKn‡1i…hÖX; Kn‡1i . Via the natural isomorphism h n—X– ˇ hn‡1—ÖX– this is equivalent to showing the bijection hn‡1—ÖX– …hÖX; Kn‡1i preserves group structure. For maps f; g : ÖX!K , the relation Tu—f ‡ g– … Tu—f – ‡ Tu—g– means —f ‡g–\u0003—u– … f \u0003—u–‡g\u0003—u– , and this holds since —f ‡g–\u0003 … f \u0003 ‡g\u0003 : h—K–!h—ÖX– by Lemma 4.60. tu We have seen in x4.3 and the preceding section how cohomology theories have a homotopy-theoretic interpretation in terms of Ú spectra, and it is natural to look for a corresponding description of homology theories. In this case we do not already have a homotopy-theoretic description of ordinary homology to serve as a starting point. But there is another homology theory we have encountered which does have a very homotopy-theoretic ﬂavor: Proposition 4F.1. Stable homotopy groups ˇ s n—X– deﬁne a reduced homology theory on the category of basepointed CW complexes and basepoint-preserving maps. Proof: In the preceding section we reformulated the axioms for a cohomology theory so that the exactness axiom asserts just the exactness of h n—X=A–!hn—X–!h n—A– for CW pairs —X; A– . In order to derive long exact sequences, the reformulated axioms Spectra and Homology Theories Section 4.F 453 require also that natural suspension isomorphisms h n—X– ˇ hn‡1—ÖX– be speciﬁed as part of the cohomology theory. The analogous reformulation of the axioms for a homology theory is valid as well, by the same argument, and we shall use this in what follows. For stable homotopy groups, suspension isomorphisms ˇ s n—X– ˇ ˇ s n‡1—ÖX– are automatic, so it remains to verify the three axioms. The homotopy axiom is appar- ent. The exactness of a sequence ˇ s n—A–!ˇ s n—X–!ˇ s n—X=A– follows from exactness of ˇn—A–!ˇn—X–!ˇn—X; A– together with the isomorphism ˇn—X; A– ˇ ˇn—X=A– which holds under connectivity assumptions that are achieved after sufﬁciently many suspensions. The wedge sum axiom ˇ s n—W \u000b X\u000b– ˇ L\u000bˇ s n—X\u000b– reduces to the case of ﬁnitely many summands by the usual compactness argument, and the case of ﬁnitely many summands reduces to the case of two summands by induction. Then we have isomorphisms ˇn‡i—Ö iX _ÖiY– ˇ ˇn‡i—Ö iX \u0002 Ö iY– ˇ ˇn‡i—Ö iX– L ˇn‡i—ÖiY– , the ﬁrst of these isomorphisms holding when n ‡ i< 2i − 1, or i>n ‡ 1 , since Ö iX _ Ö iY is the —2i − 1– skeleton of Ö iX \u0002 Ö iY . Passing to the limit over increasing i , we get the desired isomorphism ˇ s n—X _ Y– ˇ ˇ s n—X–L ˇ s n—Y – . tu A modest generalization of this homology theory can be obtained by deﬁning hn—X– … ˇ s n—X ^ K– for a ﬁxed complex K . Verifying the homology axioms reduces to the case of stable homotopy groups themselves by basic properties of smash product: hn—X– ˇ hn‡1—ÖX– since Ö—X ^ K– … —ÖX– ^ K , both spaces being S 1 ^ X ^ K . The exactness axiom holds since —X ^ K–=—A ^ K– … —X=A– ^ K , both spaces being quotients of X \u0002 K with A\u0002 K [ X \u0002fk0g collapsed to a point. The wedge axiom follows from distributivity: —W \u000b X\u000b– ^ K … W \u000b —X\u000b ^ K– . The coefﬁcients of this homology theory are hn—S 0– … ˇ s n—S 0 ^ K– … ˇ s n—K– . Sup- pose for example that K is an Eilenberg–MacLane space K—G; n– . Because K—G; n– is —n − 1– connected, its stable homotopy groups are the same as its unstable homo- topy groups below dimension 2n . Thus if we shift dimensions by deﬁning hi—X– … ˇ s i‡n( X ^ K—G; n–\u0001 we obtain a homology theory whose coefﬁcient groups below di- mension n are the same as ordinary homology with coefﬁcients in G . It follows as in Theorem 4.59 that this homology theory agrees with ordinary homology for CW complexes of dimension less than n − 1. This dimension restriction could be removed if there were a ‘stable Eilenberg– MacLane space’ whose stable homotopy groups were zero except in one dimension. However, this is a lot to ask for, so instead one seeks to form a limit of the groups ˇ s i‡n( X ^ K—G; n–\u0001 as n goes to inﬁnity. The spaces K—G; n– for varying n are related by weak homotopy equivalences K—G; n–!ÚK—G; n‡1– . Since suspension plays such a large role in the current discussion, let us consider instead the corresponding map ÖK—G; n–!K—G; n ‡ 1– , or to write this more concisely, ÖKn!Kn‡1 This induces a map ˇ s i‡n—X ^ Kn– … ˇ s i‡n‡1—X ^ ÖKn–!ˇ s i‡n‡1—X ^ Kn‡1– . Via these maps, it then 454 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory makes sense to consider the direct limit as n goes to inﬁnity, the group hi—X– … lim --!ˇ s i‡n—X ^ Kn– . This gives a homology theory since direct limits preserve exact sequences so the exactness axiom holds, and direct limits preserve isomorphisms so the suspension isomorphism and the wedge axiom hold. The coefﬁcient groups of this homology theory are the same as for ordinary homology with G coefﬁcients since hi—S 0– … lim --!ˇ s i‡n—Kn– is zero unless i … 0 , when it is G . Hence this homology theory coincides with ordinary homology by Theorem 4.59. To place this result in its natural generality, deﬁne a spectrum to be a sequence of CW complexes Kn together with basepoint-preserving maps ÖKn!Kn‡1 . This generalizes the notion of an Ú spectrum, where the maps ÖKn!Kn‡1 come from weak homotopy equivalences Kn!ÚKn‡1 . Another obvious family of examples is suspension spectra, where one starts with an arbitrary CW complex X and deﬁnes Kn … Ö nX with ÖKn!Kn‡1 the identity map. The homotopy groups of a spectrum K are deﬁned to be ˇi—K– … lim --!ˇi‡n—Kn– where the direct limit is computed using the compositions ˇi‡n—Kn– Ö----------! ˇi‡n‡1—ÖKn– ------! ˇi‡n‡1—Kn‡1– with the latter map induced by the given map ÖKn!Kn‡1 . Thus in the case of the suspension spectrum of a space X , the homotopy groups of the spectrum are the same as the stable homotopy groups of X . For a general spectrum K we could also describe ˇi—K– as lim --!ˇ s i‡n—Kn– since the composition ˇi‡n—Kn–!ˇi‡n‡j—Kn‡j– fac- tors through ˇi‡n‡j—Ö jKn– . So the homotopy groups of a spectrum are ‘stable homo- topy groups’ essentially by deﬁnition. Returning now to the context of homology theories, if we are given a spectrum K and a CW complex X , then we have a spectrum X ^ K with —X ^ K–n … X ^ Kn , using the obvious maps Ö—X ^ Kn– … X ^ ÖKn!X ^ Kn‡1 . The groups ˇi—X ^ K– are the groups lim --!ˇ s i‡n—Kn– considered earlier in the case of an Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum, and the arguments given there show: Proposition 4F.2. For a spectrum K , the groups hi—X– … ˇi—X ^ K– form a reduced homology theory. When K is the Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum with Kn … K—G; n– , this homology theory is ordinary homology, so ˇi—X ^ K– ˇ eHi—X; G– . tu If one wanted to associate a cohomology theory to an arbitrary spectrum K , one’s ﬁrst inclination would be to set hi—X– … lim --!hÖ nX; Kn‡ii , the direct limit with respect to the compositions hÖnX; Kn‡ii Ö----------! hÖ n‡1X; ÖKn‡ii ------! hÖ n‡1X; Kn‡i‡1i For example, in the case of the sphere spectrum S …fS ng this deﬁnition yields the stable cohomotopy groups ˇ i s —X– … lim --!hÖnX; S n‡ii . Unfortunately the deﬁnition hi—X– … lim --!hÖ nX; Kn‡ii runs into problems with the wedge sum axiom since the direct Spectra and Homology Theories Section 4.F 455 limit of a product need not equal the product of the direct limits. For ﬁnite wedge sums there is no difﬁculty, so we do have a cohomology theory for ﬁnite CW complexes. But for general CW complexes a different deﬁnition is needed. The simplest thing to do is to associate to each spectrum K an Ú spectrum K0 and let h n—X– …hX; K0 ni .We obtain K0 from K by setting K0 n … lim --!Ú iKn‡i , the mapping telescope of the sequence Kn!ÚKn‡1!Ú 2Kn‡2! \u0001\u0001\u0001 . The Ú spectrum structure is given by equivalences K0 n … lim --!Ú iKn‡i ' lim --!Ú i‡1Kn‡i‡1 \u0014------------! Ú lim --!Ú iKn‡i‡1 … ÚK0 n‡1 The ﬁrst homotopy equivalence comes from deleting the ﬁrst term of the sequence Kn!ÚKn‡1!Ú 2Kn‡2! \u0001\u0001\u0001 , which has negligible effect on the mapping telescope. The next map \u0014 is a special case of the natural weak equivalence lim --!ÚZn!Ú lim --!Zn that holds for any sequence Z1!Z2! \u0001\u0001\u0001 . Strictly speaking, we should let K0 n be a CW approximation to the mapping telescope lim --!Ú iKn‡i in order to obtain a spectrum consisting of CW complexes, in accordance with our deﬁnition of a spectrum. In case one starts with a suspension spectrum Kn … Ö nK it is not necessary to take mapping telescopes since one can just set K0 n … S i Ú iÖi‡nK … S i Ú iÖ iKn , the union with respect to the natural inclusions ÚiÖiKn ˆ Ú i‡1Öi‡1Kn . The union Si Ú iÖiX is usually abbreviated to Ú 1Ö1X . Another common notation for this union is QX . Thus ˇi—QX– … ˇ s i —X– ,so Q is a functor converting stable homotopy groups into ordinary homotopy groups. It follows routinely from the deﬁnitions that the homology theory deﬁned by a spectrum is the same as the homology theory deﬁned by the associated Ú spectrum. One may ask whether every homology theory is deﬁned by a spectrum, as we showed for cohomology. The answer is yes if one replaces the wedge axiom by a stronger direct limit axiom: hi—X– … lim --!hi—X\u000b– , the direct limit over the ﬁnite subcomplexes X\u000b of X . The homology theory deﬁned by a spectrum satisﬁes this axiom, and the converse is proved in [Adams 1971]. Spectra have become the preferred language for describing many stable phenom- ena in algebraic topology. The increased ﬂexibility of spectra is not without its price, however, since a number of concepts that are elementary for spaces become quite a bit more subtle for spectra, such as the proper deﬁnition of a map between spectra, or the smash product of two spectra. For the reader who wants to learn more about this language a good starting point is [Adams 1974]. Exercises 1. Assuming the ﬁrst two axioms for a homology theory on the CW category, show that the direct limit axiom implies the wedge sum axiom. Show that the converse also holds for countable CW complexes. 2. For CW complexes X and Y consider the suspension sequence hX; Y i Ö-----! hÖX; ÖY i Ö-----! hÖ 2X; Ö 2Y i -----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 456 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Show that if X is a ﬁnite complex, these maps eventually become isomorphisms. [Use induction on the number of cells of X and the ﬁve-lemma.] 3. Show that for any sequence Z1!Z2! \u0001\u0001\u0001 , the natural map lim --!ÚZn!Ú lim --!Zn is a weak homotopy equivalence, where the direct limits mean mapping telescopes. It is a common practice in algebraic topology to glue spaces together to form more complicated spaces. In this section we describe two general procedures for making such constructions. The ﬁrst is fairly straightforward but also rather rigid, lacking some homotopy invariance properties an algebraic topologist would like to see. The second type of gluing construction avoids these drawbacks by systematic use of mapping cylinders. We have already seen many special cases of both types of constructions, and having a general framework covering all these special cases should provide some conceptual clarity. A diagram of spaces consists of an oriented graph Ð with a space Xv for each vertex v of Ð and a map fe : Xv!Xw for each edge e of Ð from a vertex v to a vertex w , the words ‘from’ and ‘to’ referring to the given orientation of e . Commutativity of the diagram is not assumed. Denoting such a diagram of spaces simply by X , we deﬁne a space X to be the quotient of the disjoint union of all the spaces Xv associated to vertices of Ð under the identiﬁcations x ˘ fe—x– for all maps fe associated to edges of Ð . To give a name to this construction, let us call X the amalgamation of the diagram X . Here are some examples: If the diagram of spaces has the simple form X0 f ------ A > X1 then X is the space X0 tf X1 obtained from X0 by attaching X1 along A via f . A sequence of inclusions X1 > X1 > \u0001\u0001\u0001 determines a diagram of spaces X for which X is Si Xi with the weak topology. This holds more generally when the spaces Xi are indexed by any directed set. From a cover U …fXig of a space X by subspaces Xi we can form a diagram of spaces XU whose vertices are the nonempty ﬁnite intersections Xi1 \\\u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ Xin with distinct indices ij , and whose edges are the various inclusions obtained by omitting some of the subspaces in such an intersection, for example the inclusions Xi \\ Xj > Xi . Then XU equals X as a set, though possibly with a different topology. If the cover is an open cover, or if X is a CW complex and the Xi ’s are subcomplexes, then the topology will be the original topology on X . An action of a group G on a space X determines a diagram of spaces XG , with X itself as the only space and with maps the homeomorphisms g : X!X , g 2 G , given by the action. In this case XG is the orbit space X=G . Gluing Constructions Section 4.G 457 A Ñ complex X can be viewed as a diagram of spaces XÑ where each simplex of X gives a vertex space Xv which is a simplex of the same dimension, and the edge maps are the inclusions of faces into the simplices that contain them. Then XÑ … X . It can very easily happen that for a diagram of spaces X the amalgamation X is rather useless because so much collapsing has occurred that little of the original diagram remains. For example, consider a diagram X of the form X0 X0 \u0002 X1!X1 whose maps are the projections onto the two factors. In this case X is simply a point. To correct for problems like this, and to get a notion with nicer homotopy-theoretic properties, we introduce the homotopy version of X , which we shall denote ÑX and call the realization of X . Here we again start with the disjoint union of all the vertex spaces Xv , but instead of passing to a quotient space of this disjoint union, we enlarge it by ﬁlling in a mapping cylinder Mf for each map f of the diagram, identifying the two ends of this cylinder with the appropriate Xv ’s. In the case of the projection diagram X0 X0 \u0002 X1!X1 , the union of the two mapping cylinders is the same as the quotient of X0 \u0002 X1 \u0002 I with X0 \u0002 X1 \u0002f0g collapsed to X0 and X0 \u0002 X1 \u0002f1g collapsed to X1 . Thus ÑX is the join X0 \u0003 X1 deﬁned in Chapter 0. We have seen a number of other special cases of the construction ÑX . For a dia- gram consisting of just one map f : X0!X1 one gets of course the mapping cylinder Mf itself. For a diagram X0 f ------ X1 g -----! X2 the realization ÑX is a double mapping cylinder. In case X2 is a point this is the mapping cone of f . When the diagram has just one space and one map from this space to itself, then ÑX is the mapping torus. For a diagram consisting of two maps f; g : X0!X1 the space ÑX was studied in Ex- ample 2.48. Mapping telescopes are the case of a sequence of maps X0!X1! \u0001\u0001\u0001 . In x1.B we considered general diagrams in which the spaces are K—G; 1– ’s. There is a natural generalization of ÑX in which one starts with a Ñ complex Ð and a diagram of spaces associated to the 1 skeleton of Ð such that the maps corresponding to the edges of each n simplex of Ð , n> 1 , form a commutative di- agram. We call this data a complex of spaces.If X is a complex of spaces, then for each n simplex of Ð we have a sequence of maps X0 f1-----! X1 f2-----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 fn-----! Xn , and we deﬁne the iterated mapping cylinder M—f1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;fn– to be the usual map- ping cylinder for n … 1 , and inductively for n> 1 , the mapping cylinder of the composition M—f1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;fn−1–!Xn−1 fn-----! Xn where the ﬁrst map is the canonical projection of a mapping cylinder onto its target end. There is a natural projection M—f1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;fn–!Ñ n , and over each face of Ñ n one has the iterated mapping cylin- der for the maps associated to the edges in this face. For example when n … 2 one has the three mapping cylinders M—f1– , M—f2– , and M—f2f1– over the three edges of Ñ2 . All these iterated mapping cylinders over the various simplices of Ð thus ﬁt together to form a space ÑX with a canonical projection ÑX!Ð . We again call ÑX the realization of the complex of spaces X , and we call Ð the base of X or ÑX . 458 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Some of our earlier examples of diagrams of spaces can be regarded in a natural way as complexes of spaces: For a cover U …fXig of a space X the diagram of spaces XU whose vertices are the ﬁnite intersections of Xi ’s and whose edges are inclusions is a complex of spaces with n simplices the n fold inclusions. The base Ð for this complex of spaces is the barycentric subdivision of the nerve of the cover. Recall from the end of x3.3 that the nerve of a cover is the simplicial complex with n simplices the nonempty —n ‡ 1– fold intersections of sets in the cover. The diagram of spaces XG associated to an action of a group G on a space X is a complex of spaces, with n simplices corresponding to the n fold compositions X g1-----! X g2-----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 gn-----! X . The base Ñ complex Ð is the K—G; 1– called BG in x1.B. This was the orbit space of a free action of G on a contractible Ñ complex EG . Checking through the deﬁnitions, one sees that the space ÑXG in this case can be regarded as the quotient of X \u0002 EG under the diagonal action of G , g—x; y– … —g—x–; g—y–– . This is the space we called the Borel construction in x3.G, with the notation X \u0002G EG . By a map f : X!Y of complexes of spaces over the same base Ð we mean a collection of maps fv : Xv!Yv for all the vertices of Ð , with commutative squares over all edges of Ð . There is then an induced map Ñf : ÑX!ÑY . Proposition 4G.1. If all the maps fv making up a map of complexes of spaces f : X!Y are homotopy equivalences, then so is the map Ñf : ÑX!ÑY . Proof: The mapping cylinders M—fv – form a complex of spaces M—f – over the same base Ð , and the space ÑM—f – is the mapping cylinder M—Ñf– . This deformation retracts onto ÑY , so it will sufﬁce to show that it also deformation retracts onto ÑX . Let M n—Ñf– be the part of M—Ñf– lying over the n skeleton of Ð . We claim that M n—Ñf– [ ÑX deformation retracts onto M n−1—Ñf– [ ÑX . It is enough to show this when Ð … Ñn . In this case f is a map from X0! \u0001\u0001\u0001 !Xn to Y0! \u0001\u0001\u0001 !Yn .By Corollary 0.20 it sufﬁces to show that the inclusion M n−1—Ñf– [ ÑX > M—Ñf– is a homotopy equivalence and the pair —M—Ñf–; M n−1—Ñf– [ ÑX– satisﬁes the homotopy extension property. The latter assertion is evident from Example 0.15 since a mapping cylinder neighborhood is easily constructed for this pair. For the other condition, note that by induction on the dimension of Ð we may assume that M n−1—Ñf– deformation retracts onto the part of ÑX over @Ñn . Also, the inclusion ÑX > M—Ñf– is a ho- motopy equivalence since it is equivalent to the map Xn!Yn , which is a homotopy equivalence by hypothesis. So Corollary 0.20 applies, and the claim that M n—Ñf–[ÑX deformation retracts onto M n−1—Ñf– [ ÑX is proved. Letting n vary, the inﬁnite concatenation of these deformation retractions in the t intervals ƒ1=2 n‡1; 1=2 n⁄ gives a deformation retraction of M—Ñf– onto ÑX . tu Gluing Constructions Section 4.G 459 There is a canonical map ÑX! X induced by retracting each mapping cylinder onto its target end. In some cases this is a homotopy equivalence, for example, for a diagram X0 A > X1 where the pair —X1;A– has the homotopy extension prop- erty. Another example is a sequence of inclusions X0 > X1 > \u0001\u0001\u0001 for which the pairs —Xn;Xn−1– satisfy the homotopy extension property, by the argument involving map- ping telescopes in the proof of Lemma 2.34. However, without some conditions on the maps it need not be true that ÑX! X is a homotopy equivalence, as the earlier example of the projections X0 X0 \u0002 X1!X1 shows. Even with inclusion maps one need not have ÑX ' X if the base Ð is not contractible. A trivial example is the diagram consisting of the two spaces Ñ 0 and Ñ 1 and two maps f0;f1 : Ñ 0!Ñ1 that happen to have the same image. Thus one can expect the map ÑX! X to be a homotopy equivalence only in special circumstances. Here is one such situation: Proposition 4G.2. When XU is the complex of spaces associated to an open cover U …fXig of a paracompact space X , the map p : ÑXU! XU … X is a homotopy equivalence. Proof: The realization ÑXU can also be described as the quotient space of the disjoint union of all the products Xi0 \\ \u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ Xin \u0002 Ñ n , as the subscripts range over sets of n ‡ 1 distinct indices and n \u0015 0 , with the identiﬁcations over the faces of Ñ n using inclusions Xi0 \\ \u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ Xin > Xi0 \\\u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ bXij \\\u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ Xin . From this viewpoint, points of ÑXU in a given ‘ﬁber’ p−1—x– can be written as ﬁnite linear combinations P i tixi where P i ti … 1 and xi is x regarded as a point of Xi , for those Xi ’s that contain x . Since X is paracompact there is a partition of unity subordinate to the cover U . This is a family of maps '\u000b : X!ƒ0; 1⁄ satisfying three conditions: The sup- port of each '\u000b is contained in some Xi—\u000b– , only ﬁnitely many '\u000b ’s are nonzero near each point of X , and P\u000b '\u000b … 1 . Deﬁne a section s : X!ÑXU of p by setting s—x– … P\u000b '\u000b—x–xi—\u000b– . The ﬁgure shows the case X … S 1 with a cover by two arcs, the heavy line indicating the image of s . In the general case the section s embeds X as a retract of ÑXU , and it is a deformation retract since points in ﬁbers p−1—x– can move linearly along line segments to s—x– . tu Corollary 4G.3. If U is an open cover of a paracompact space X such that every nonempty intersection of ﬁnitely many sets in U is contractible, then X is homotopy equivalent to the nerve NU . Proof: The proposition gives a homotopy equivalence X ' ÑXU . Since the nonempty ﬁnite intersections of sets in U are contractible, the earlier proposition implies that the map ÑXU!Ð induced by sending each intersection to a point is a homotopy equivalence. Since Ð is the barycentric subdivision of NU , the result follows. tu 460 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Let us conclude this section with a few comments about terminology. For some diagrams of spaces such as sequences X1!X2! \u0001\u0001\u0001 the amalgamation X can be regarded as the direct limit of the vertex spaces Xv with respect to the edge maps fe . Following this cue, the space X is commonly called the direct limit for arbitrary diagrams, even ﬁnite ones. If one views X as a direct limit, then ÑX becomes a sort of homotopy direct limit. For reasons that are explained in the next section, direct limits are often called ‘colimits.’ This has given rise to the rather unfortunate name of ‘hocolim’ for ÑX , short for ‘homotopy colimit.’ In preference to this we have chosen the term ‘realization,’ both for its intrinsic merits and because ÑX is closely related to what is called the geometric realization of a simplicial space. Exercises 1. Show that for a sequence of maps X0 f1-----! X1 f2-----! \u0001\u0001\u0001 , the inﬁnite iterated mapping cylinder M—f1;f2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– , which is the union of the ﬁnite iterated mapping cylinders M—f1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;fn– , deformation retracts onto the mapping telescope. 2. Show that if X is a complex of spaces in which all the maps are homeomorphisms, then the projection ÑX!Ð is a ﬁber bundle. 3. What is the nerve of the cover of a simplicial complex by the open stars of its vertices? [See Lemma 2C.2.] 4. Show that Proposition 4G.2 and its corollary hold also for CW complexes and covers by families of subcomplexes. [CW complexes are paracompact; see [VBKT].] There is a very nice duality principle in homotopy theory, called Eckmann–Hilton duality in its more reﬁned and systematic aspects, but which in its most basic form involves the simple idea of reversing the direction of all arrows in a given construc- tion. For example, if in the deﬁnition of a ﬁbration as a map satisfying the homotopy lifting property we reverse the direction of all the arrows, we obtain the dual notion of a coﬁbration. This is a map i : A!B satisfying the following prop- erty: Given eg0 : B!X and a homotopy gt : A!X such that eg0i … g0 , ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡!A B X i gt g 0 » there exists a homotopy egt : B!X such that egti … gt . In the special case that i is the inclusion of a subspace, this is the homotopy extension property, and the next proposition says that this is indeed the general case. So a coﬁbration is the same as an inclusion satisfying the homotopy extension property. Proposition 4H.1. If i : A!B is a coﬁbration, then i is injective, and in fact a homeo- morphism onto its image. Eckmann–Hilton Duality Section 4.H 461 Proof: Consider the mapping cylinder Mi , the quotient of A\u0002 I q B in which —a; 1– is identiﬁed with i—a– . Let gt : A!Mi be the homotopy mapping a 2 A to the image of —a; 1 − t– 2 A\u0002 I in Mi , and let eg0 be the inclusion B > Mi . The coﬁbration property gives egt : B!Mi with egti … gt . Restricting to a ﬁxed t> 0 , this implies i is injective since gt is. Furthermore, since gt is a homeomorphism onto its image A\u0002f1 − tg , the relation egti … gt implies that the map g−1 t egt : i—A–!A is a continuous inverse of i : A!i—A– . tu Many constructions for ﬁbrations have analogs for coﬁbrations, and vice versa. For example, for an arbitrary map f : A!B the inclusion A > Mf is readily seen to be a coﬁbration, so the analog of the factorization A > Ef !B of f into a homotopy equivalence followed by a ﬁbration is the factorization A> Mf !B into a coﬁbration followed by a homotopy equivalence. Even the deﬁnition of Mf is in some way dual to the deﬁnition of Ef , since Ef can be deﬁned as a pullback and Mf can be deﬁned as a dual pushout. In general, the pushout of maps ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!A MAI B f£ ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡!¡¡!¡¡!E BA IBf f : Z!X and g : Z!Y is deﬁned as the quotient of X q Y under the identiﬁcations f—z– ˘ g—z– . Thus the pushout is a quotient of X qY , while the pullback of maps X!Z and Y!Z is a subobject of X \u0002 Y , so we see here two instances of duality: a duality between disjoint union and product, and a duality between subobjects and quotients. The ﬁrst of these is easily explained, since a collection of maps X\u000b!X is equivalent to a map ` \u000bX\u000b!X , while a collection of maps X!X\u000b is equivalent to a map X!Q \u000b X\u000b . The notation ` for the ‘coproduct’ was chosen to indicate that it is dual to Q . If we were dealing with basepointed spaces and maps, the coproduct would be wedge sum. In the category of abelian groups the coproduct is direct sum. The duality between subobjects and quotient objects is clear for abelian groups, where subobjects are kernels and quotient objects cokernels. The strict topological analog of a kernel is a ﬁber of a ﬁbration. Dually, the topological analog of a cokernel is the coﬁber B=A of a coﬁbration A> B . If we make an arbitrary map f : A!B into a coﬁbration A > Mf , the coﬁber is the mapping cone Cf … Mf =—A\u0002f0g– . In the diagram showing Ef and Mf as pullback and pushout, there also appears to be some sort of duality involving the terms A\u0002 I and BI . This leads us to ask whether X \u0002 I and XI are in some way dual. Indeed, if we ignore topology and just think set- theoretically, this is an instance of the familiar product–coproduct duality since the product of copies of X indexed by I is XI , all functions I!X , while the coproduct of copies of X indexed by I is X \u0002 I , the disjoint union of the sets X \u0002ftg for t 2 I . Switching back from the category of sets to the topological category, we can view XI as a ‘continuous product’ of copies of X and X \u0002 I as a ‘continuous coproduct.’ On a less abstract level, the fact that maps A\u0002 I!B are the same as maps A!BI indicates a certain duality between A\u0002 I and BI . This leads to a duality between 462 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory suspension and loopspace, since ÖA is a quotient of A\u0002 I and ÚB is a subspace of BI . This duality is expressed in the adjoint relation hÖX; Y i…hX; ÚY i from x4.3. Combining this duality between Ö and Ú with the duality between ﬁbers and coﬁbers, we see a duality relationship between the ﬁbration and coﬁbration sequences of x4.3: \u0001\u0001\u0001 -! ÚF -! ÚE -! ÚB -! F -! E -! B A!X!X=A!ÖA!ÖX!Ö—X=A–! \u0001\u0001\u0001 Pushout and pullback constructions can be generalized to arbitrary diagrams. In the case of pushouts, this was done in x4.G where we associated a space X to a dia- gram of spaces X . This was the quotient of the coproduct ` v Xv , with v ranging over vertices of the diagram, under the identiﬁcations x ˘ fe—x– for all maps fe associated to edges e of the diagram. The dual construction X would be the subspace of the product Q v Xv consisting of tuples —xv – with fe—xv – … xw for all maps fe : Xv!Xw in the diagram. Perhaps more useful in algebraic topology is the homotopy variant of this notion obtained by dualizing the deﬁnition of ÑX in the previous section. This is the space rX consisting of all choices of a point xv in each Xv and a path γe in the target space of each edge map fe : Xv!Xw , with γe—0– … f—xv – and γe—1– … xw . The subspace with all paths constant is X . In the case of a diagram \u0001\u0001\u0001 !X2!X1 such as a Postnikov tower this construction gives something slightly different from simply turning each successive map into a ﬁbration via the usual pathspace construc- tion, starting with X2!X1 and proceeding up the tower, as we did in x4.3. The latter construction is rather the dual of an iterated mapping cylinder, involving spaces of maps Ñn!Xv instead of simply pathspaces. One could use such mapping spaces to generalize the deﬁnition of rX from diagrams of spaces to complexes of spaces. As special cases of the constructions X and X we have direct limits and inverse limits for diagrams X0!X1! \u0001\u0001\u0001 and \u0001\u0001\u0001 !X1!X0 , respectively. Since inverse limit is related to product and direct limit to coproduct, it is common practice in some circles to use reverse logic and call inverse limit simply ‘limit’ and direct limit ‘colimit.’ The homotopy versions are then called ‘holim’ for rX and ‘hocolim’ for ÑX . This terminology is frequently used for more general diagrams as well. Homotopy Groups with Coefﬁcients There is a somewhat deeper duality between homotopy groups and cohomology, which one can see in the fact that cohomology groups are homotopy classes of maps into a space with a single nonzero homotopy group, while homotopy groups are ho- motopy classes of maps from a space with a single nonzero cohomology group. This duality is in one respect incomplete, however, in that the cohomology statement holds for an arbitrary coefﬁcient group, but we have not yet deﬁned homotopy groups with coefﬁcients. In view of the duality, one would be tempted to deﬁne ˇn—X; G– to be the set of basepoint-preserving homotopy classes of maps from the cohomology analog of a Moore space M—G; n– to X . The cohomology analog of M—G; n– would be a space Eckmann–Hilton Duality Section 4.H 463 Y whose only nonzero cohomology group eHi—Y ; Z– is G for i … n . Unfortunately, such a space does not exist for arbitrary G , for example for G … Q , since we showed in Proposition 3F.12 that if the cohomology groups of a space are all countable, then they are all ﬁnitely generated.. As a ﬁrst approximation to ˇn—X; G– let use consider hM—G; n–; Xi , the set of basepoint-preserving homotopy classes of maps M—G; n–!X . To give this set a more suggestive name, let us call it \u0016n—X; G– . We should assume n> 1 to guarantee that the homotopy type of M—G; n– is well-deﬁned, as shown in Example 4.34. For n> 1, \u0016n—X; G– is a group since we can choose M—G; n– to be the suspension of an M—G; n − 1– . And if n> 2 then \u0016n—X; G– is abelian since we can choose M—G; n– to be a double suspension. There is something like a universal coefﬁcient theorem for these groups \u0016n—X; G– : Proposition 4H.2. For n> 1 there are natural short exact sequences 0 -! Ext—G; ˇn‡1—X–– -! \u0016n—X; G– -! Hom—G; ˇn—X–– -! 0: The similarity with the universal coefﬁcient theorem for cohomology is apparent, but with a reversal of the variables in the Ext and Hom terms, reﬂecting the fact that \u0016n—X; G– is covariant as a functor of X and contravariant as a functor of G , just like the Ext and Hom terms. Proof: Let 0!R i-----! F -! G!0 be a free resolution of G . The inclusion map i is realized by a map M—R; n–!M—F ; n– , where M—R; n– and M—F ; n– are wedges of S n ’s corresponding to bases for F and R . Converting this map into a coﬁbration via the mapping cylinder, the coﬁber is an M—G; n– , as one sees from the long exact sequence of homology groups. As in x4.3, the coﬁbration sequence M—R; n–!M—F ; n–!M—G; n–!M—R; n ‡ 1–!M—F ; n ‡ 1– gives rise to the exact sequence across the top of the following diagram: ¹ XFn 1()+ ; ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡! ¹ XRn 1()+ ; F(), ¡¡¡¡!¹ XGn (); ¡¡¡¡! ¹ XFn (); ¹ XRn ();¡¡¡¡¡¡! Hom Xn 1()+¼ R(),Hom Xn 1()+¼==== i¤ ¡¡¡!F(),Hom Xn()¼ R(),Hom Xn ()¼==== i¤ The four outer terms of the exact sequence can be identiﬁed with the indicated Hom terms since mapping a wedge sum of S n ’s into X amounts to choosing an element of ˇn—X– for each wedge summand. The kernel and cokernel of i \u0003 are Hom—G; −– and Ext—G; −– by deﬁnition, and so we obtain the short exact sequence we are looking for. Naturality will be left for the reader to verify. tu Unlike in the universal coefﬁcient theorems for homology and cohomology, the short exact sequence in this proposition does not split in general. For an example, take G … Z2 and X … M—Z2;n– for n \u0015 2 , where the identity map of M—Z2;n– 464 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory deﬁnes an element of \u0016n—M—Z2;n–; Z2– …hM—Z2; n–; M—Z2;n–i having order 4 , as we show in Example 4L.7, whereas the two outer terms in the short exact sequence can only contain elements of order 2 since G … Z2 . This example shows also that \u0016n—X; Zm– need not be a module over Zm , as homology and cohomology groups with Zm coefﬁcients are. The proposition implies that the ﬁrst nonzero \u0016i—S n; Zm– is \u0016n−1—S n; Zm– … Zm , from the Ext term. This result would look more reasonable if we changed notation to replace the subscript n − 1by n . So let us make the deﬁnition ˇn—X; Zm– …hM—Zm;n − 1–; Xi… \u0016n−1—X; Zm– There are two good reasons to expect this to be the right deﬁnition. The ﬁrst is formal: M—Zm;n − 1– is a ‘cohomology M—Zm;n– ’ since its only nontrivial cohomology group eHi—M—Zm;n − 1–; Z– is Zm in dimension n . The second reason is more geometric: Elements of ˇn—X; Zm– should be homotopy classes of ‘homotopy-theoretic cycles mod m ,’ meaning maps Dm!X whose boundary is not necessarily a constant map as would be the case for ˇn—X– , but rather whose boundary is m times a cycle S n−1!X . This is precisely what a map M—Zm;n − 1–!X is, if we choose M—Zm;n − 1– to be S n−1 with a cell en attached by a map of degree m . Besides the calculation ˇn—S n; Zm– ˇ Zm , the proposition also yields an isomor- phism ˇn—M—Zm;n–; Zm– ˇ Ext—Zm; Zm– … Zm . Both these results are in fact special cases of a Hurewicz-type theorem relating ˇn—X; Zm– and Hn—X; Zm– , which is proved in [Neisendorfer 1980]. Along with Z and Zm , another extremely useful coefﬁcient group for homology and cohomology is Q . We pointed out above the difﬁculty that there is no coho- mology analog of M—Q;n– . The groups \u0016n—X; Q– are also problematic. For example the proposition gives \u0016n−1—S n; Q– ˇ Ext—Q; Z– , which is a somewhat complicated un- countable group as we showed in x3.F. However, there is an alternative approach that turns out to work rather well. One deﬁnes rational homotopy groups simply as ˇn—X– ⊗ Q , analogous to the isomorphism Hn—X; Q– ˇ Hn—X; Z– ⊗ Q from the univer- sal coefﬁcient theorem for homology. See [SSAT] for more on this. Homology Decompositions Eckmann–Hilton duality can be extremely helpful as an organizational principle, reducing signiﬁcantly what one has to remember, and providing valuable hints on how to proceed in various situations. To illustrate, let us consider what would happen if we dualized the notion of a Postnikov tower of principal ﬁbrations, where a space is represented as an inverse limit of a sequence of ﬁbers of maps to Eilenberg–MacLane spaces. In the dual representation, a space would be realized as a direct limit of a sequence of coﬁbers of maps from Moore spaces. In more detail, suppose we are given a sequence of abelian groups Gn , n \u0015 1, and we build a CW complex X with Hn—X– ˇ Gn for all n by constructing inductively Eckmann–Hilton Duality Section 4.H 465 an increasing sequence of subcomplexes X1 ˆ X2 ˆ\u0001\u0001\u0001 with Hi—Xn– ˇ Gi for i \u0014 n and Hi—Xn– … 0 for i>n , where: (1) X1 is a Moore space M—G1; 1– . (2) Xn‡1 is the mapping cone of a cellular map hn : M—Gn‡1;n–!Xn such that the induced map hn\u0003 : Hn( M—Gn‡1;n–\u0001 !Hn—Xn– is trivial. (3) X … Sn Xn . One sees inductively that Xn‡1 has the desired homology groups by comparing the long exact sequences of the pairs —Xn‡1;Xn– and —CM; M– where M … M—Gn‡1;n– and CM is the cone M \u0002 I=M \u0002f0g : XXH n(),n 1+H0 ()n 1+ n 1+ XH n()n XH 0()n n n 1+ n 1+Xn 1+ ¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! @ MCMH (),n 1+ MH ()n G¡¡¡¡¡! @ ¼ ¼ ¼ ¤h The assumption that hn\u0003 is trivial means that the boundary map in the upper row is zero, hence Hn‡1—Xn‡1– ˇ Gn‡1 . The other homology groups of Xn‡1 are the same as those of Xn since Hi—Xn‡1;Xn– ˇ Hi—CM; M– for all i by excision, and Hi—CM; M– ˇ eHi−1—M– since CM is contractible. In case all the maps hn are trivial, X is the wedge sum of the Moore spaces M—Gn;n– since in this case the mapping cone construction in (2) produces a wedge sum with the suspension of M—Gn‡1;n– , a Moore space M—Gn‡1;n ‡ 1– . For a space Y , a homotopy equivalence f : X!Y where X is constructed as in (1)–(3) is called a homology decomposition of Y . Theorem 4H.3. Every simply-connected CW complex has a homology decomposition. Proof: Given a simply-connected CW complex Y , let Gn … Hn—Y – . Suppose in- ductively that we have constructed Xn via maps hi as in (2), together with a map f : Xn!Y inducing an isomorphism on Hi for i \u0014 n . The induction can start with X1 a point since Y is simply-connected. To construct Xn‡1 we ﬁrst replace Y by the mapping cylinder of f : Xn!Y , converting f into an inclusion. By the Hurewicz theorem and the homology exact sequence of the pair —Y ; Xn– we have ˇn‡1—Y ; Xn– ˇ Hn‡1—Y ; Xn– ˇ Hn‡1—Y – … Gn‡1 . We will use this isomorphism to construct a map hn : M—Gn‡1;n–!Xn and an extension f : Xn‡1!Y . The standard construction of an M—Gn‡1;n– consists of a wedge of spheres S n \u000b corresponding to generators g\u000b of Gn‡1 , with cells en‡1 \f attached according to certain linear combinations r\f … P\u000b n\u000b\fg\u000b that are zero in Gn‡1 . Under the iso- morphism Gn‡1 ˇ ˇn‡1—Y ; Xn– each g\u000b corresponds to a basepoint-preserving map f\u000b : —CS n;S n–!—Y ; Xn– where CS n is the cone on S n . The restrictions of these f\u000b ’s to S n deﬁne hn : W \u000b S n \u000b!Xn , and the maps f\u000b : CS n!Y themselves give an exten- sion of f : Xn!Y to the mapping cone of hn : W \u000b S n \u000b!Xn . Each relation r\f gives a homotopy F\f : —CS n;S n–\u0002 I!—Y ; Xn– from P\u000b n\u000b\ff\u000b to the constant map. We use 466 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory F\f jj S n \u0002f0g to attach en‡1 \f , and then F\f jj S n \u0002 I gives hn on en‡1 \f and F\f gives an extension of f over the cone on en‡1 \f . This construction assures that f\u0003 : Hn‡1—Xn‡1;Xn–!Hn‡1—Y ; Xn– is an isomor- phism, so from the ﬁve-lemma applied to the long exact sequences of these pairs we deduce that f\u0003 : Hi—Xn‡1–!Hi—Y – is an isomorphism for i \u0014 n ‡ 1 . This ﬁnishes the induction step. We may assume the maps f\u000b and F\f are cellular, so X … Sn Xn is a CW complex with subcomplexes Xn . Since f : X!Y is a homology isomorphism between simply-connected CW complexes, it is a homotopy equivalence. tu As an example, suppose that Y is a simply-connected CW complex having all its homology groups free. Then the Moore spaces used in the construction of X can be taken to be wedges of spheres, and so Xn is obtained from Xn−1 by attaching an n cell for each Z summand of Hn—Y – . The attaching maps may be taken to be cellular, making X into a CW complex whose cellular chain complex has trivial boundary maps. Similarly, ﬁnite cyclic summands of Hn—Y – can be realized by wedge summands of the form S n−1 [ en in M—Hn—Y –; n − 1– , contributing an n cell and an —n ‡ 1– cell to X . This is Proposition 4C.1, but the present result is stronger because it tells us that a ﬁnite cyclic summand of Hn can be realized in one step by attaching the cone on a Moore space M—Zk;n − 1– , rather than in two steps of attaching an n cell and then an —n ‡ 1– cell.

For ﬁbrations E1!B and E2!B , show that a ﬁber-preserving map E1!E2 that is a homotopy equivalence is in fact a ﬁber homotopy equivalence. [This is dual to Proposition 0.19.] 4. Deﬁne the dual of an iterated mapping cylinder precisely, in terms of maps from Ñn , and use this to give a deﬁnition of rX , the dual of ÑX , for X a complex of spaces. It sometimes happens that suspending a space has the effect of simplifying its homotopy type, as the suspension becomes homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of Stable Splittings of Spaces Section 4.I 467 smaller spaces. Much of the interest in such stable splittings comes from the fact that they provide a geometric explanation for algebraic splittings of homology and cohomology groups, as well as other algebraic invariants of spaces that are unaffected by suspension such as the cohomology operations studied in x4.L. The simplest example of a stable splitting occurs for the torus S 1 \u0002 S 1 . Here the reduced suspension Ö—S 1 \u0002 S 1– is homotopy equivalent to S 2 _S 2 _S 3 since Ö—S 1 \u0002 S 1– is S 2 _ S 2 with a 3 cell attached by the suspension of the attaching map of the 2 cell of the torus, but the latter attaching map is the commutator of the two inclusions S 1 > S 1 , and the suspension of this commutator is trivial since it lies in the abelian group ˇ2—S 2 _ S 2– . By an easy geometric argument we will prove more generally: Proposition 4I.1. If X and Y are CW complexes, then Ö—X \u0002 Y– ' ÖX_ÖY _Ö—X^Y– . For example, Ö—Sm \u0002 S n– ' S m‡1 _ S n‡1 _ S m‡n‡1 . In view of the cup product structure on H\u0003—S m \u0002 S n– there can be no such splitting of S m \u0002 S n before suspension. Proof: Consider the join X \u0003 Y deﬁned in Chapter 0, consisting of all line segments joining points in X to points in Y . For our present purposes it is convenient to use the reduced version of the join, obtained by collapsing to a point the line segment joining the basepoints x0 2 X and y0 2 Y . We will still denote this reduced join by X \u0003 Y . Consider the space obtained from X \u0003 Y by attaching reduced cones CX and CY to the copies of X and Y at the two ends of X \u0003 Y . If we col- CX CY X Y¤ X Y lapse each of these cones to a point, we get the reduced suspension Ö—X \u0002 Y– . Since each cone is contractible, collapsing the cones gives a homotopy equivalence X \u0003 Y [ CX [ CY ' Ö—X \u0002 Y– . Inside X \u0003 Y there are also cones x0 \u0003 Y and X \u0003 y0 intersecting in a point. Collapsing these cones converts X \u0003 Y into Ö—X ^ Y– and X \u0003 Y [ CX [ CY into Ö—X ^ Y– _ ÖX _ ÖY . tu This result can be applied inductively to obtain splittings for suspensions of prod- ucts of more than two spaces, using the fact that reduced suspension is smash product with S 1 , and smash product is associative and commutative. For example, Ö—X \u0002 Y \u0002 Z– ' ÖX _ ÖY _ ÖZ _ Ö—X ^ Y– _ Ö—X ^ Z– _ Ö—Y ^ Z– _ Ö—X ^ Y ^ Z– Our next example involves the reduced product J—X– deﬁned in x3.2. An inter- esting case is J—S n– , which has a CW structure of the form S n [ e2n [ e3n [\u0001\u0001\u0001 . All the cells ein for i> 1 are attached nontrivially since H\u0003—J—S n–; Q– is a polynomial ring Qƒx⁄ for n even and a tensor product Qƒx⁄ ⊗ ÓQƒy⁄ for n odd. However, after we suspend to ÖJ—S n– , it is a rather surprising fact that all the attaching maps become trivial: 468 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Proposition 4I.2. ÖJ—S n– ' S n‡1 _ S 2n‡1 _ S 3n‡1 _\u0001\u0001\u0001 . More generally, if X is a connected CW complex then ÖJ—X– ' W n ÖX^n where X^n denotes the smash product of n copies of X . Proof: The space J—X– is the union of an increasing sequence of subcomplexes Jk—X– with Jk—X– a quotient of the k fold product X \u0002 k . The quotient Jk—X–=Jk−1—X– is X^k . Thus we have maps X \u0002 k -! Jk—X– -! X^k … Jk—X–=Jk−1—X– By repeated application of the preceding proposition, ÖX^k is a wedge summand of ÖX \u0002 k , up to homotopy equivalence. The proof shows moreover that there is a map ÖX^k!ÖX \u0002 k such that the composition ÖX^k!ÖX \u0002 k!ÖX^k is homotopic to the identity. This composition factors as ÖX^k -! ÖX \u0002 k -! ÖJk—X– -! ÖX^k so we obtain a map sk : ÖX^k!ÖJk—X– such that ÖX^k sk-----! ÖJk—X–!ÖX^k is homo- topic to the identity. The map sk induces a splitting of the long exact sequence of homology groups for the pair —ÖJk—X–; ÖJk−1—X–– . Hence the map i _ sk : ÖJk−1—X– _ ÖX^k!ÖJk—X– induces an isomorphism on homology, where i denotes the inclusion map. It follows by induction that the map Wn k…1sk : Wn k…1ÖX^k!Jn—X– induces an isomorphism on homology for all ﬁnite n . This implies the corresponding statement for n …1 since X^n is —n − 1– connected if X is connected. Thus we have a map W k ÖX^k!ÖJ—X– inducing an isomorphism on homology. By Whitehead’s theorem this map is a homo- topy equivalence since the spaces are simply-connected CW complexes. tu For our ﬁnal example the stable splitting will be constructed using the group structure on hÖX; Y i , the set of basepointed homotopy classes of maps ÖX!Y . Proposition 4I.3. For any prime power pn the suspension ÖK—Zpn ; 1– is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum X1_\u0001\u0001\u0001_Xp−1 where Xi is a CW complex having eH\u0003—Xi; Z– nonzero only in dimensions congruent to 2i mod 2p − 2 . This result is best possible in a strong sense: No matter how many times any one of the spaces Xi is suspended, it never becomes homotopy equivalent to a nontrivial wedge sum. This will be shown in Example 4L.3 by studying cohomology operations in H\u0003—K—Zpn ; 1–; Zp– . There is also a somewhat simpler K–theoretic explanation for this; see [VBKT]. Proof: Let K … K—Zpn ; 1– . The multiplicative group of nonzero elements in the ﬁeld Zp is cyclic, so let the integer r represent a generator. By Proposition 1B.9 there is a map f : K!K inducing multiplication by r on ˇ1—K– . We will need to know that f induces multiplication by r i on H2i−1—K; Z– ˇ Zpn , and this can be seen as follows. Via Stable Splittings of Spaces Section 4.I 469 the natural isomorphism ˇ1—K– ˇ H1—K; Z– we know that f induces multiplication by r on H1—K; Z– . Via the universal coefﬁcient theorem, f also induces multiplica- tion by r on H1—K; Zpn – and H2—K; Zpn – . The cup product structure in H\u0003—K; Zpn – computed in Examples 3.41 and 3E.2 then implies that f induces multiplication by r i on H2i−1—K; Zpn – , so the same is true for H2i−1—K; Z– by another application of the universal coefﬁcient theorem. For each integer j \u0015 0 let hj : ÖK!ÖK be the difference Öf − r j11, so hj in- duces multiplication by r i − r j on H2i—ÖK; Z– ˇ Zpn . By the choice of r we know that p divides r i − r j iff i \u0011 j mod p − 1 . This means that the map induced by hj on eH2i—ÖK; Z– has nontrivial kernel iff i \u0011 j mod p − 1 . Therefore the composition mi … h1 \u000e \u0001\u0001\u0001 hi−1 \u000e hi‡1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 hp−1 induces an isomorphism on eH\u0003—ÖK; Z– in dimen- sions congruent to 2i mod 2p − 2 and has a nontrivial kernel in other dimensions where the homology group is nonzero. When there is a nontrivial kernel, some power of mi will induce the zero map since we are dealing with homomorphisms Zpn!Zpn . Let Xi be the mapping telescope of the sequence ÖK!ÖK! \u0001\u0001\u0001 where each map is mi . Since homology commutes with direct limits, the inclusion of the ﬁrst factor ÖK > Xi induces an isomorphism on eH\u0003 in dimensions congruent to 2i mod 2p − 2, and eH\u0003—Xi; Z– … 0 in all other dimensions. The sum of these inclusions is a map ÖK!X1 _\u0001\u0001\u0001 _ Xp−1 inducing an isomorphism on all homology groups. Since these complexes are simply-connected, the result follows by Whitehead’s theorem. tu The construction of the spaces Xi as mapping telescopes produces rather large spaces, with inﬁnitely many cells in each dimension. However, by Proposition 4C.1 each Xi is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex with the minimum conﬁguration of cells consistent with its homology, namely, a 0 cell and a k cell for each k congruent to 2i or 2i ‡ 1 mod 2p − 2. Stable splittings of K—G; 1– ’s for ﬁnite groups G have been much studied and are a complicated and subtle business. To take the simplest noncyclic example, Proposi- tion 4I.1 implies that ÖK—Z2 \u0002 Z2; 1– splits as the wedge sum of two copies of ÖK—Z2; 1– and Ö( K—Z2; 1– ^ K—Z2; 1–\u0001 , but the latter summand can be split further, according to a result in [Harris & Kuhn 1988] which says that for G the direct sum of k copies of Zpn , ÖK—G; 1– splits canonically as the wedge sum of pieces having exactly pk − 1 distinct homotopy types. Some of these summands occur more than once, as we see in the case of Z2 \u0002 Z2 . Exercises 1. If a connected CW complex X retracts onto a subcomplex A , show that ÖX ' ÖA _ Ö—X=A– . [One approach: Show the map Ör ‡ Öq : ÖX!ÖA _ Ö—X=A– induces an isomorphism on homology, where r : X!A is the retraction and q : X!X=A is the quotient map.] 470 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory 2. Using the K¨unneth formula, show that ÖK—Zm \u0002 Zn; 1– ' ÖK—Zm; 1– _ ÖK—Zn; 1– if m and n are relatively prime. Thus to determine stable splittings of K—Zn; 1– it sufﬁces to do the case that n is a prime power, as in Proposition 4I.3. 3. Extending Proposition 4I.3, show that the —2k ‡ 1– skeleton of the suspension of a lens space with fundamental group of order pn is homotopy equivalent to the wedge sum of the —2k ‡ 1– skeleta of the spaces Xi , if these Xi ’s are chosen to have the minimum number of cells in each dimension, as described in the remarks following the proof. Loopspaces appear at ﬁrst glance to be hopelessly complicated objects, but if one is only interested in homotopy type, there are many cases when great simpliﬁcations are possible. One of the nicest of these cases is the loopspace of a sphere. We show in this section that ÚS n‡1 has the weak homotopy type of the James reduced product J—S n– introduced in x3.2. More generally, we show that ÚÖX has the weak homotopy type of J—X– for every connected CW complex X . If one wants, one can strengthen ‘weak homotopy type’ to ‘homotopy type’ by quoting Milnor’s theorem, mentioned in x4.3, that the loopspace of a CW complex has the homotopy type of a CW complex. Part of the interest in ÚÖX can be attributed to its close connection with the sus- pension homomorphism ˇi—X–!ˇi‡1—ÖX– . We will use the weak homotopy equiva- lence of ÚÖX with J—X– to give another proof that the suspension homomorphism is an isomorphism in dimensions up to approximately double the connectivity of X .In addition, we will obtain an exact sequence that measures the failure of the suspension map to be an isomorphism in dimensions between double and triple the connectivity of X . An easy application of this, together with results proved elsewhere in the book, will be to compute ˇn‡1—S n– and ˇn‡2—S n– for all n . As a rough ﬁrst approximation to ÚS n‡1 there is a natural inclusion of S n into ÚS n‡1 obtained by regarding S n‡1 as the reduced suspension ÖS n , the quotient —S n \u0002 I–=—S n \u0002 @I[feg\u0002 I– where e is the basepoint of S n , then associating to each point x 2 S n the loop \u0015—x– in ÖS n given by t , —x; t– . The ﬁgure shows what a few such loops look e like. However, we cannot expect this inclusion S n > ÚS n‡1 to be a homotopy equivalence since ÚS n‡1 is an H–space but S n is only an H–space when n … 1; 3; 7 by the theorem of Adams discussed in x4.B. The simplest way to correct this deﬁciency in Sn would be to replace it by the free H–space that it generates, the reduced product J—S n– . Re- The Loopspace of a Suspension Section 4.J 471 call from x3.2 that a point in J—S n– is a formal product x1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 xk of points xi 2 S n , with the basepoint e acting as an identity element for the multiplication obtained by juxtaposition of formal products. We would like to deﬁne a map \u0015 : J—S n–!ÚS n‡1 by setting \u0015—x1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 xk– … \u0015—x1– \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0015—xk– , the product of the loops \u0015—xi– . The only difﬁculty is in the parametrization of this product, which needs to be adjusted so that \u0015 is continuous. The problem is that when some xi approaches the basepoint e 2 S n , one wants the loop \u0015—xi– to disappear gradually from the product \u0015—x1– \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0015—xk– , without disrupting the parametrization as simply deleting \u0015—e– would do. This can be achieved by ﬁrst making the time it takes to traverse each loop \u0015—xi– equal to the distance from xi to the basepoint of S n , then normalizing the resulting product of loops so that it takes unit time, giving a map I!ÖS n . More generally, this same procedure deﬁnes a map \u0015 : J—X–!ÚÖX for any con- nected CW complex X , where ‘distance to the basepoint’ is replaced by any map d : X!ƒ0; 1⁄ with d −1—0– … e , the basepoint of X . Theorem 4J.1. The map \u0015 : J—X–!ÚÖX is a weak homotopy equivalence for every connected CW complex X . Proof: The main step will be to compute the homology of ÚÖX . After this is done, it will be easy to deduce that \u0015 induces an isomorphism on homology using the cal- culation of the homology of J—X– in Proposition 3C.8, and from this conclude that \u0015 is a weak homotopy equivalence. It will turn out to be sufﬁcient to consider homol- ogy with coefﬁcients in a ﬁeld F . We know that H\u0003—J—X–; F– is the tensor algebra T eH\u0003—X; F– by Proposition 3C.8, so we want to show that H\u0003—ÚÖX; F– has this same structure, a result ﬁrst proved in [Bott & Samelson 1953]. Let us write the reduced suspension Y … ÖX as the union of two reduced cones Y‡ … C‡X and Y− … C−X intersecting in the equatorial X ˆ ÖX . Consider the path ﬁbration p : PY!Y with ﬁber ÚY . Let P‡Y … p−1—Y‡– and P−Y … p−1—Y−– ,so P‡Y consists of paths in Y starting at the basepoint and ending in Y‡ , and similarly for P−Y . Then P‡Y \\ P−Y is p−1—X– , the paths from the basepoint to X . Since Y‡ and Y− are deformation retracts of open neighborhoods U‡ and U− in Y such that U‡ \\ U− deformation retracts onto Y‡ \\ Y− … X , the homotopy lifting property implies that P‡Y , P−Y , and p‡Y \\ P−Y are deformation retracts, in the weak sense, of open neighborhoods p−1—U‡– , p−1—U−– , and p−1—U‡– \\ p−1—U−– , respectively. Therefore there is a Mayer–Vietoris sequence in homology for the decomposition of PY as P‡Y [P−Y . Taking reduced homology and using the fact that PY is contractible, this gives an isomorphism —i– Ø : eH\u0003—P‡Y \\ P−Y ; F– ˇ------------! eH\u0003—P‡Y ; F–L eH\u0003—P−Y ; F– The two coordinates of Ø are induced by the inclusions, with a minus sign in one case, but Ø will still be an isomorphism if this minus sign is eliminated, so we may assume this has been done. 472 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory We claim that the isomorphism Ø can be rewritten as an isomorphism —ii– Ò : eH\u0003—ÚY \u0002 X; F– ˇ------------! eH\u0003—ÚY ; F–L eH\u0003—ÚY ; F– To see this, we observe that the ﬁbration P‡Y!Y‡ is ﬁber-homotopically trivial. This is true since the cone Y‡ is contractible, but we shall need an explicit ﬁber homo- topy equivalence P‡Y ' ÚY \u0002 Y‡ , and this is easily constructed as follows. Deﬁne f‡ : P‡Y!ÚY \u0002 Y‡ by f‡—γ– … —γ γ‡ y ;y– where y … γ—1– and γ‡ y is the obvious path in Y‡ from y … —x; t– to the basepoint along the segment fxg\u0002 I . In the other direction, deﬁne g‡ : ÚY \u0002 Y‡!P‡Y by g‡—γ; y– … γ γ ‡ y where the bar denotes the inverse path. Then f‡g‡ and g‡f‡ are ﬁber-homotopic to the respective identity maps since γ ‡ y γ‡ y and γ‡ y γ ‡ y are homotopic to the constant paths. In similar fashion the ﬁbration P−Y!Y− is ﬁber-homotopically trivial via maps f− and g− . By restricting a ﬁber-homotopy trivialization of either P‡Y or P−Y to P‡Y \\ P−Y , we see that the ﬁbration P‡Y \\ P−Y is ﬁber-homotopy equivalent to the product ÚY \u0002 X . Let us do this using the ﬁber-homotopy trivialization of P−Y . The groups in (i) can now be replaced by those in (ii). The map Ø has coordinates induced by inclusion, and it follows that the corresponding map Ò in (ii) has coordinates induced by the two maps ÚY \u0002 X!ÚY , —γ; x– , γ \u0015—x– and —γ; x– , γ . Namely, the ﬁrst coordinate of Ò is induced by f‡g− jj ÚY \u0002 X followed by projection to ÚY , and the second coordinate is the same but with f−g− in place of f‡g− . Writing the two coordinates of Ò as Ò1 and Ò2 , the fact that Ò is an isomorphism means that the restriction of Ò1 to the kernel of Ò2 is an isomorphism. Via the K¨unneth formula we can write eH\u0003—ÚY \u0002 X; F– as ( H\u0003—ÚY ; F– ⊗ eH\u0003—X; F–\u0001L eH\u0003—ÚY ; F– where projection onto the latter summand is Ò2 . Hence Ò1 gives an isomorphism from the ﬁrst summand H\u0003—ÚY ; F– ⊗ eH\u0003—X; F– onto eH\u0003—ÚY ; F– . Since Ò1—γ; x– … —γ \u0015—x–– , this means that the composed map H\u0003—ÚY ; F– ⊗ eH\u0003—X; F– 11 ⊗ \u0015\u0003-----------------------------! H\u0003—ÚY ; F– ⊗ eH\u0003—ÚY ; F– --------! eH\u0003—ÚY ; F– with the second map Pontryagin product, is an isomorphism. Now to ﬁnish the calcu- lation of H\u0003—ÚY ; F– as the tensor algebra T eH\u0003—X; F– , we apply the following algebraic lemma, with A … H\u0003—ÚY ; F– , V … eH\u0003—X; F– , and i … \u0015\u0003 . Lemma 4J.2. Let A be a graded algebra over a ﬁeld F with A0 … F and let V be a graded vector space over F with V0 … 0 . Suppose we have a linear map i : V!A pre- serving grading, such that the multiplication map \u0016 : A ⊗ V! eA , \u0016—a ⊗ v– … ai—v– ,is an isomorphism. Then the canonical algebra homomorphism i : TV!A extending the previous i is an isomorphism. For example, if V is a 1 dimensional vector space over F , as happens in the case X … S n , then this says that if the map A! eA given by right-multiplication by an element a … i—v– is an isomorphism, then A is the polynomial algebra F ƒa⁄ . The The Loopspace of a Suspension Section 4.J 473 general case can be viewed as the natural generalization of this to polynomials in any number of noncommuting variables. Proof: Since \u0016 is an isomorphism, each element a 2 An with n> 0 can be written uniquely in the form \u0016(Pj aj ⊗ vj\u0001 … P j aji—vj– for vj 2 V and aj 2 An—j– , with n—j– < n since V0 … 0 . By induction on n , aj … i—\u000bj– for a unique \u000bj 2 —T V –n—j– . Thus a … i (Pj \u000bj ⊗ vj\u0001 so i is surjective. Since these representations are unique, i is also injective. The induction starts with the hypothesis that A0 … F , the scalars in TV . tu Returning now to the proof of the theorem, we observe that \u0015 is an H–map: The two maps J—X–\u0002 J—X–!ÚÖX , —x; y– , \u0015—xy– and —x; y– , \u0015—x–\u0015—y– , are homo- topic since the loops \u0015—xy– and \u0015—x–\u0015—y– differ only in their parametrizations. Since \u0015 is an H–map, the maps X > J—X– \u0015-----! ÚÖX in- duce the commutative diagram at the right. We FXJH (());¤ ¤ FXH ();¤¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! \u0000§ FXTH (); ¤ » ¸have shown that the downward map on the right is an isomorphism, and the same is true of the one on the left by the calculation of H\u0003—J—X–; F– in Proposition 3C.8. Hence \u0015\u0003 is an isomorphism. By Corollary 3A.7 this is also true for Z coefﬁcients. When X is simply-connected, so are J—X– and ÚÖX , so after taking a CW approximation to ÚÖX , Whitehead’s theorem implies that \u0015 is a weak homotopy equivalence. In the general case that X is only connected, we obtain the same conclusion by applying the gener- alization of Whitehead’s theorem to abelian spaces, Proposition 4.74, since J—X– and ÚÖX are H–spaces, hence have trivial action of ˇ1 on all homotopy groups. tu Using the natural identiﬁcation ˇi—ÚÖX– … ˇi‡1—ÖX– , the inclusion X > ÚÖX induces the suspension map ˇi—X–!ˇi‡1—ÖX– . Since this inclusion factors through J—X– , we can identify the relative groups ˇi—ÚÖX; X– with ˇi—J—X–; X– .If X is n connected then the pair —J—X–; X– is —2n ‡ 1– connected since we can replace X by a complex with n skeleton a point, and then the —2n ‡ 1– skeleton of J—X– is contained in X . Thus we have: Corollary 4J.3. The suspension map ˇi—X–!ˇi‡1—ÖX– for an n connected CW complex X is an isomorphism if i \u0014 2n and a surjection if i … 2n ‡ 1 . tu In the case of a sphere we can describe what happens in the ﬁrst dimension when suspension is not an isomorphism, namely the suspension ˇ2n−1—S n–!ˇ2n—S n‡1– which the corollary guarantees only to be a surjection. The CW structure on J—S n– consists of a single cell in each dimension a multiple of n , so from exactness of ˇ2n—J—S n–; S n– @-----! ˇ2n−1—S n– Ö-----! ˇ2n—S n‡1– we see that the kernel of the suspension ˇ2n−1—S n–!ˇ2n—S n‡1– is generated by the attaching map of the 2n cell of J—S n– . This attaching map is the Whitehead product ƒ11; 11⁄ , as we noted in x4.2 when we 474 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory deﬁned Whitehead products following Example 4.52. When n is even, the Hopf in- variant homomorphism ˇ2n−1—S n–!Z has the value \u00062on ƒ11; 11⁄ , as we saw in x4.B. If there is no map of Hopf invariant \u00061 , it follows that ƒ11; 11⁄ generates a Z summand of ˇ2n−1—S n– , and so the suspension homomorphism simply cancels this summand from ˇ2n−1—S n– . By Adams’ theorem, this is the situation for all even n except 2 , 4 , and 8 . When n … 2 we have ˇ3—S 2– ˇ Z generated by the Hopf map \u0011 with Hopf invari- ant 1 , so 2\u0011 …\u0006ƒ11; 11⁄ , generating the kernel of the suspension, hence: Corollary 4J.4. ˇn‡1—S n– is Z2 for n \u0015 3 , generated by the suspension or iterated suspension of the Hopf map. tu The situation for n … 4 and 8 is more subtle. We do not have the tools available here to do the actual calculation, but if we consult the table near the beginning of x4.1 we see that the suspension ˇ7—S 4–!ˇ8—S 5– is a map Z\b Z12!Z24 . By our preceding remarks we know this map is surjective with kernel generated by the single element ƒ11; 11⁄ . Algebraically, what must be happening is that the coordinate of ƒ11; 11⁄ in the Z summand is twice a generator, while the coordinate in the Z12 summand is a generator. Thus a generator of the Z summand, which we may take to be the Hopf map S 7!S 4 , suspends to a generator of the Z24 . For n … 8 the situation is entirely similar, with the suspension ˇ15—S 8–!ˇ16—S 9– a homomorphism Z\b Z120!Z240 . We can also obtain some information about suspension somewhat beyond the edge of the stable dimension range. Since S n is —n − 1– connected and —J—S n–; S n– is —2n − 1– connected, we have isomorphisms ˇi—J—S n–; S n– ˇ ˇi—J—S n–=S n– for i \u0014 3n − 2 by Proposition 4.28. The group ˇi—J—S n–=S n– is isomorphic to ˇi—S 2n– in the same range i \u0014 3n − 2 since J—S n–=S n has S 2n as its —3n − 1– skeleton. Thus the terminal portion of the long exact sequence of the pair —J—S n–; S n– starting with the term ˇ3n−2—S n– can be written in the form ˇ3n−2—S n– \u0006-----! ˇ3n−1—S n‡1–!ˇ3n−2—S 2n–!ˇ3n−3—S n– \u0006-----! ˇ3n−2—S n‡1–! \u0001\u0001\u0001 This is known as the EHP sequence since its three maps were originally called E , H , and P . (The German word for ‘suspension’ begins with E, the H refers to a gen- eralization of the Hopf invariant, and the P denotes a connection with Whitehead products; see [Whitehead 1978] for more details.) Note that the terms ˇi—S 2n– in the EHP sequence are stable homotopy groups since i \u0014 3n − 2 . Thus we have the curi- ous situation that stable homotopy groups are measuring the lack of stability of the groups ˇi—S n– in the range 2n − 1 \u0014 i \u0014 3n − 2 , the so-called metastable range. Specializing to the ﬁrst interesting case n … 2 , the sequence becomes S()4 2 2 ¼ ¡¡¡¡¡! S()5 3¼ ¡¡¡¡¡! S()4 4¼ ¡¡¡¡¡! S()3 2¼ ¡¡¡¡¡! S 0()4 3¼ ¡¡¡¡¡! §§ Z¼ 2Z¼ Z¼ Z¼ The Dold–Thom Theorem Section 4.K 475 From the Hopf bundle S 1!S 3!S 2 we have ˇ4—S 2– ˇ ˇ4—S 3– ˇ Z2 , with ˇ4—S 2– gen- erated by the composition \u0011—Ö\u0011– where \u0011 is the Hopf map S 3!S 2 . From exactness of the latter part of the sequence we deduce that the map ˇ4—S 4–!ˇ3—S 2– is injective, and hence that the suspension ˇ4—S 2–!ˇ5—S 3– is surjective, so ˇ5—S 3– is either Z2 or 0 . From the general suspension theorem, the suspension ˇ5—S 3–!ˇ6—S 4– is surjec- tive as well, and the latter group is in the stable range. We show in Proposition 4L.11 that the stable group ˇ s 2 is nonzero, and so we conclude that ˇn‡2—S n– ˇ Z2 for all n \u0015 2 , generated by the composition —Ön−2\u0011–—Ö n−1\u0011– . We will see in [SSAT] that the EHP sequence extends all the way to the left to form an inﬁnite exact sequence when n is odd, and when n is even a weaker statement holds: The sequence extends after factoring out all odd torsion. Replacing S n by any —n − 1– connected CW complex X , our derivation of the ﬁnite EHP sequence generalizes immediately to give an exact sequence ˇ3n−2—X– \u0006-----! ˇ3n−1—ÖX–!ˇ3n−2—X ^ X–!ˇ3n−3—X– \u0006-----! ˇ3n−2—ÖX–! \u0001\u0001\u0001 using the fact that J2—X–=X … X ^ X . The generalization of the results of this section to Ú nÖ nX turns out to be of some importance in homotopy theory. In case we do not get to this topic in [SSAT], the reader can begin to learn about it by looking at [Carlsson & Milgram 1995]. Exercise 1. Show that ÚÖX for a nonconnected CW complex X reduces to the connected case by showing that each path-component of ÚÖX is homotopy equivalent to ÚÖ(W \u000b X\u000b\u0001 where the X\u000b ’s are the components of X . In the preceding section we studied the free monoid J—X– generated by a space X , and in this section we take up its commutative analog, the free abelian monoid generated by X . This is the inﬁnite symmetric product SP —X– introduced brieﬂy in x3.C. The main result will be a theorem of [Dold & Thom 1958] asserting that ˇ\u0003SP —X– ˇ eH\u0003—X; Z– for all connected CW complexes X . In particular this yields the surprising fact that SP —S n– is a K—Z;n– , and more generally that the functor SP takes Moore spaces M—G; n– to Eilenberg–MacLane spaces K—G; n– . This leads to the general result that for all connected CW complexes X , SP —X– has the homotopy type of a product of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces. In other words, the k invariants of SP —X– are all trivial. 476 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory The main step in the proof of the Dold–Thom theorem will be to show that the homotopy groups ˇ\u0003SP —X– deﬁne a homology theory. An easy computation of the coefﬁcient groups ˇ\u0003SP —S n– will then show that this must be ordinary homology with Z coefﬁcients. A new idea needed for the proof of the main step is the notion of a quasiﬁbration, generalizing ﬁbrations and ﬁber bundles. In order to establish a few basic facts about quasiﬁbrations we ﬁrst make a small detour to prove an essentially elementary fact about relative homotopy groups. A Mayer–Vietoris Property of Homotopy Groups In this subsection we will be concerned largely with relative homotopy groups, and it will be impossible to avoid the awkward fact that there is no really good way to deﬁne the relative ˇ0 . What we will do as a compromise is to take ˇ0—X;A;x0– to be the quotient set ˇ0—X; x0–=ˇ0—A; x0– . This at least allows the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for —X; A– to end with the terms ˇ0—A; x0–!ˇ0—X; x0–!ˇ0—X;A;x0–!0 An exercise for x4.1 shows that the ﬁve-lemma can be applied to the map of long exact sequences induced by a map —X; A–!—Y ; B– , provided the basepoint is allowed to vary. However, the long exact sequence of a triple cannot be extended through the ˇ0 terms with this deﬁnition, so one must proceed with some caution. The excision theorem for homology involves a space X with subspaces A and B such that X is the union of the interiors of A and B . In this situation we call —X; A; B– an excisive triad. By a map f : —X; A; B–!—Y ; C; D– we mean f : X!Y with f —A– ˆ C and f—B– ˆ D . Proposition 4K.1. Let f : —X; A; B–!—Y ; C; D– be a map of excisive triads. If the induced maps ˇi—A; A \\ B–!ˇi—C; C \\ D– and ˇi—B; A \\ B–!ˇi—D; C \\ D– are bijections for i<n and surjections for i … n , for all choices of basepoints, then the same is true of the induced maps ˇi—X; A–!ˇi—Y ; C– . By symmetry the conclusion holds also for the maps ˇi—X; B–!ˇi—Y ; D– . The corresponding statement for homology is a trivial consequence of excision which says that Hi—X; A– ˇ Hi—B; A \\ B– and Hi—Y ; C– ˇ Hi—D; C \\ D– , soitisnot necessary to assume anything about the map Hi—A; A \\ B–!Hi—C; C \\ D– . With the failure of excision for homotopy groups, however, it is not surprising that the assump- tion on ˇi—A; A \\ B–!ˇi—C; C \\ D– cannot be dropped. An example is provided by the quotient map f : D2!S 2 collapsing @D2 to the north pole of S 2 , with C and D the northern and southern hemispheres of S 2 , and A and B their preimages under f . Proof: First we will establish a general fact about relative homotopy groups. Con- sider an inclusion —X; A– > —Y ; C– . We will show the following three conditions are equivalent for each n \u0015 1: The Dold–Thom Theorem Section 4.K 477 (i) For all choices of basepoints the map ˇi—X; A–!ˇi—Y ; C– induced by inclusion is surjective for i … n and has trivial kernel for i … n − 1. X Y Y A A C C C (ii) Let @Dn be written as the union of hemispheres @‡Dn and @−Dn intersecting in S n−2 . Then every map —Dn \u0002f0g[ @‡Dn \u0002 I; @−Dn \u0002f0g[ S n−2 \u0002 I– -! —Y ; C– taking —@‡Dn \u0002f1g;S n−2 \u0002f1g– to —X; A– extends to a map —Dn \u0002 I; @−Dn \u0002 I–!—Y ; C– taking —Dn \u0002f1g;@−Dn \u0002f1g– to —X; A– . (iii) Condition (ii) with the added hypothesis that the restriction of the given map to @‡Dn \u0002 I is independent of the I coordinate. It is obvious that (ii) and (iii) are equivalent since the stronger hypothesis in (iii) can always be achieved by composing with a homotopy of Dn \u0002 I that shrinks @‡Dn \u0002 I to @‡Dn \u0002f1g . To see that (iii) implies (i), let f : —@‡Dn \u0002f1g;S n−2 \u0002f1g–!—X; A– represent an element of ˇn−1—X; A– . If this is in the kernel of the map to ˇn−1—Y ; C– , then we get an extension of f over Dn \u0002f0g[ @‡Dn \u0002 I , with the constant homotopy on @‡Dn \u0002 I and —Dn \u0002f0g;@−Dn \u0002f0g– mapping to —Y ; C– . Condition (iii) then gives an extension over Dn \u0002 I , whose restriction to Dn \u0002f1g shows that f is zero in ˇn−1—X; A– ,so the kernel of ˇn−1—X; A–!ˇn−1—Y ; C– is trivial. To check surjectivity of the map ˇn—X; A–!ˇn—Y ; C– , represent an element of ˇn—Y ; C– by a map f : Dn \u0002f0g!Y taking @−Dn \u0002f0g to C and @‡Dn \u0002f0g to a chosen basepoint. Extend f over @‡Dn \u0002 I via the constant homotopy, then extend over Dn \u0002 I by applying (iii). The result is a homotopy of the given f to a map representing an element of the image of ˇn—X; A–!ˇn—Y ; C– . X Y Y A A C C A X x0 Now we show that (i) implies (ii). Given a map f as in the hypothesis of (ii), the injectivity part of (i) gives an extension of f over Dn \u0002f1g . Choose a small disk En ˆ @−Dn \u0002 I , shown shaded in the ﬁgure, intersecting @−Dn \u0002f1g in a hemisphere @‡En of its boundary. We may assume the extended f has a constant value x0 2 A on @‡En . Viewing the extended f as representing an element of ˇn—Y ;C;x0– , the surjectivity part of (i) then gives an extension of f over Dn \u0002 I taking —En;@−En– to —X; A– and the rest of @−Dn \u0002 I to C . The argument is ﬁnished by composing this extended f with a deformation of Dn \u0002 I pushing En into Dn \u0002f1g . Having shown the equivalence of (i)–(iii), let us prove the proposition. We may reduce to the case that the given f : —X; A; B–!—Y ; C; D– is an inclusion by using map- ping cylinders. One’s ﬁrst guess would be to replace —Y ; C; D– by the triad of mapping cylinders —Mf ; Mf jA;Mf jB– , where we view f jj A as a map A!C and f jj B as a map B!D . However, the triad —Mf ; Mf jA;Mf jB– need not be excisive, for example if X 478 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory consists of two points A and B and Y is a single point. To remedy this problem, replace Mf jA by its union with f −1—C–\u0002 —1=2; 1– in Mf , and enlarge Mf jB similarly. Now we prove the proposition for an inclusion —X; A; B– > —Y ; C; D– . The case n … 0 is trivial from the deﬁnitions, so let us assume n \u0015 1 . In view of the equivalence of condition (i) with (ii) and (iii), it sufﬁces to show that condition (ii) for the inclusions —A; A \\ B– > —C; C \\ D– and —B; A \\ B– > —D; C \\ D– implies (iii) for the inclusion —X; A– > —Y ; C– . Let a map f : Dn \u0002f0g[ @‡Dn \u0002 I!Y as in the hypothesis of (iii) be given. The argument will involve subdivision of Dn into smaller disks, and for this it is more convenient to use the cube In instead of Dn , so let us identify In with Dn in such a way that @−Dn corresponds to the face In−1 \u0002f1g , which we denote by @−In , and @‡Dn corresponds to the remaining faces of In , which we denote by @‡In . Thus we are given f on In \u0002f0g taking @‡In \u0002f0g to X and @−In \u0002f0g to C , and on @‡In \u0002 I we have the constant homotopy. Since —Y ; C; D– is an excisive triad, we can subdivide each of the I factors of In \u0002f0g into subintervals so that f takes each of the resulting n dimensional sub- cubes of In \u0002f0g into either C or D . The extension of f we construct will have the following key property: —\u0003– If K is a one of the subcubes of In \u0002f0g , or a lower-dimensional face of such a cube, then the extension of f takes —K \u0002 I; K \u0002f1g– to —C; A– or —D; B– when- ever f takes K to C or D , respectively. Initially we have f deﬁned on @‡In \u0002 I with image in X , independent of the I co- ordinate, and we may assume the condition —\u0003– holds here since we may assume that A … X \\ C and B … X \\ D , these conditions holding for the mapping cylinder construction described above. Consider the problem of extending f over K \u0002 I for K one of the subcubes. We may assume that f has already been extended to @‡K \u0002 I so that —\u0003– is satisﬁed, by induction on n and on the sequence of subintervals of the last coordinate of In \u0002f0g . To extend f over K \u0002 I , let us ﬁrst deal with the cases that the given f takes —K; @−K– to —C; C \\ D– or —D; C \\ D– . Then by (ii) for the inclusion —A; A \\ B–> —C; C \\ D– or —B; A \\ B– > —D; C \\ D– we may extend f over K \u0002 I so that —\u0003– is still satisﬁed. If neither of these two cases applies, then the given f takes —K; @−K– just to —C; C– or —D; D– , and we can apply (ii) trivially to construct the desired extension of f over K \u0002 I . tu Corollary 4K.2. Given a map f : X!Y and open covers fUig of X and fVig of Y with f—Ui– ˆ Vi for all i , then if each restriction f : Ui!Vi and more generally each f : Ui1 \\\u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ Uin!Vi1 \\\u0001\u0001\u0001 \\ Vin is a weak homotopy equivalence, so is f : X!Y . Proof: First let us do the case of covers by two sets. By the ﬁve-lemma, the hypothe- ses imply that ˇn—Ui;U1 \\ U2–!ˇn—Vi;V1 \\ V2– is bijective for i … 1; 2, n \u0015 0, The Dold–Thom Theorem Section 4.K 479 and all choices of basepoints. The preceding proposition then implies that the maps ˇn—X; U1–!ˇn—Y ; V1– are isomorphisms. Hence by the ﬁve-lemma again, so are the maps ˇn—X–!ˇn—Y – . By induction, the case of ﬁnite covers by k> 2 sets reduces to the case of covers by two sets, by letting one of the two sets be the union of the ﬁrst k − 1 of the given sets and the other be the k th set. The case of inﬁnite covers reduces to the ﬁnite case since for surjectivity of ˇn—X–!ˇn—Y – , a map S n!Y has compact image covered by ﬁnitely many Vi ’s, and similarly for injectivity. tu Quasiﬁbrations A map p : E!B with B path-connected is a quasiﬁbration if the induced map p\u0003 : ˇi—E; p−1—b–; x0–!ˇi—B; b– is an isomorphism for all b 2 B , x0 2 p−1—b– , and i \u0015 0 . We have shown in Theorem 4.41 that ﬁber bundles and ﬁbrations have this property for i> 0 , as a consequence of the homotopy lifting property, and the same reasoning applies for i … 0 since we assume B is path-connected. For example, consider the natural projection Mf !I of the mapping cylinder of a map f : X!Y . This projection will be a quasiﬁbration iff f is a weak homotopy equivalence, since the lat- ter condition is equivalent to having ˇi( Mf ;p−1—b– \u0001 … 0 … ˇi—I; b– for all i and all b 2 I . Note that if f is not surjective, there are paths in I that do not lift to paths in Mf with a prescribed starting point, so p will not be a ﬁbration in such cases. An alternative condition for a map p : E!B to be a quasiﬁbration is that the inclusion of each ﬁber p−1—b– into the homotopy ﬁber Fb of p over b is a weak homotopy equivalence. Recall that Fb is the space of all pairs —x; γ– with x 2 E and γ a path in B from p—x– to b . The actual ﬁber p−1—b– is included in Fb as the pairs with x 2 p−1—b– and γ the constant path at x . To see the equivalence of the two deﬁnitions, consider the commutative triangle at the right, where Fb!Ep!B is the usual path-ﬁbration Ep b¼i ( ( )) E¼ip Fb() ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡!,, B¼i b(), - 1 construction applied to p . The right-hand map in the diagram is an isomorphism for all i \u0015 0 , and the upper map will be an isomorphism for all i \u0015 0 iff the inclusion p−1—b– > Fb is a weak equivalence since E ' Ep . Hence the two deﬁnitions are equivalent. Recall from Proposition 4.61 that all ﬁbers of a ﬁbration over a path-connected base are homotopy equivalent. Since we are only considering quasiﬁbrations over path-connected base spaces, this implies that all the ﬁbers of a quasiﬁbration have the same weak homotopy type. Quasiﬁbrations over a base that is not path-connected are considered in the exercises, but we will not need this generality in what follows. The following technical lemma gives various conditions for recognizing that a map is a quasiﬁbration, which will be needed in the proof of the Dold–Thom theorem. 480 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Lemma 4K.3. A map p : E!B is a quasiﬁbration if any one of the following condi- tions is satisﬁed : (a) B can be decomposed as the union of open sets V1 and V2 such that each of the restrictions p−1—V1–!V1 , p−1—V2–!V2 , and p−1—V1 \\ V2–!V1 \\ V2 is a quasiﬁbration. (b) B is the union of an increasing sequence of subspaces B1 ˆ B2 ˆ \u0001\u0001\u0001 , with the weak or direct limit topology, such that each restriction p−1—Bn–!Bn is a quasiﬁbration. (c) There is a deformation Ft of E into a subspace E0 , covering a deformation F t of B into a subspace B0 , such that the restriction E0!B0 is a quasiﬁbration and F1 : p−1—b–!p−1(F 1—b– \u0001 is a weak homotopy equivalence for each b 2 B . By a ‘deformation’ in (c) we mean a deformation retraction in the weak sense as deﬁned in the exercises for Chapter 0, where the homotopy is not required to be the identity on the subspace. Proof: (a) To avoid some tedious details we will consider only the case that the ﬁbers of p are path-connected, which will sufﬁce for our present purposes, leaving the general case as an exercise for the reader. This hypothesis on ﬁbers guarantees that all ˇ0 ’s arising in the proof are trivial. In particular, by an exercise for x4.1 this allows us to terminate long exact sequences of homotopy groups of triples with zeros in the ˇ0 positions. Let U1 … p−1—V1– and U2 … p−1—V2– . By applying the ﬁve-lemma to the long exact sequences of homotopy groups of the triples ( Uk;U1 \\U2;p−1—b– \u0001 and —Vk;V1 \\V2;b– we deduce that the maps ˇi—Uk;U1 \\ U2–!ˇi—Vk;V1 \\ V2– are isomorphisms for k … 1; 2 and all i . Then Proposition 4K.1 implies that the maps ˇi—E; U1–!ˇi—B; V1– are isomorphisms. The hypothesis that the maps ˇi( U1;p−1—b– \u0001 !ˇi—V1;b– are iso- morphisms then implies via the ﬁve-lemma that the maps ˇi( E; p−1—b– \u0001 !ˇi—B; b– are isomorphisms. (b) This is the standard compactness argument for direct limits. Every compact sub- space of E lies in one of the subspaces En … p−1—Bn– ,so ˇi( E; p−1—b– \u0001 is the direct limit lim --!ˇi( En;p−1—b– \u0001 , hence the map ˇi( E; p−1—b– \u0001 !ˇi—B; b– is an isomorphism if each map ˇi( En;p−1—b– \u0001 !ˇi—B; b– is an isomorphism. (c) Consider the commutative diagram Ep b( ( )) ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! , Bb(), B(), - 1 EFpb( (( ))), - 1 1 0 0 ¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! EFpb( (( ))), - 1 1 ¡ Fb()1 ¡F1 F1 ¡¡¡!¡¡! where the upper right map is inclusion. The composition across the top of the dia- gram induces an isomorphism on relative homotopy groups via the ﬁve-lemma and the hypothesis that F1 : p−1—b–!p−1( F 1—b– \u0001 is a weak homotopy equivalence. Since the inclusion E0 > E is a homotopy equivalence, the upper right map also induces The Dold–Thom Theorem Section 4.K 481 isomorphisms on relative homotopy groups. Hence the upper left map F1 induces isomorphisms on relative homotopy groups. The lower map F 1 is a homotopy equiv- alence, so from commutativity of the diagram we deduce that the left-hand vertical map induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups since this is true of the right-hand vertical map by assumption. tu Symmetric Products Let us recall the deﬁnition from x3.C. For a space X the n fold symmetric product SPn—X– is the quotient space of the product of n copies of X obtained by factoring out the action of the symmetric group permuting the factors. A choice of basepoint e 2 X gives inclusions SPn—X–>SPn‡1—X– induced by —x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn–,—x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xn;e– , and SP —X– is deﬁned to be the union of this increasing sequence of spaces, with the direct limit topology. Note that SPn is a homotopy functor: A map f : X!Y induces f\u0003 : SPn—X–!SPn—Y – , and f ' g implies f\u0003 ' g\u0003 . Hence X ' Y implies SPn—X– ' SPn—Y – . In similar fashion SP is a homotopy functor on the category of basepointed spaces and basepoint-preserving homotopy classes of maps. It follows that X ' Y implies SP —X– ' SP —Y – for connected CW complexes X and Y since in this case requiring maps and homotopies to preserve basepoints does not affect the relation of homotopy equivalence. Example 4K.4. An interesting special case is when X … S 2 because in this case SP —S 2– can be identiﬁed with CP1 in the following way. We ﬁrst identify CPn with the nonzero polynomials of degree at most n with coefﬁcients in C , modulo scalar mul- tiplication, by letting a0 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ anzn correspond to the line containing —a0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;an– . The sphere S 2 we view as C [ f1g , and then we deﬁne f : —S2–n!CPn by setting f—a1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;an– … —z ‡ a1– \u0001\u0001\u0001 —z ‡ an– with factors z ‡1 omitted, so in particular f—1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 1– … 1 . To check that f is continuous, suppose some ai approaches 1 , say an , and all the other aj ’s are ﬁnite. Then if we write —z ‡ a1– \u0001\u0001\u0001 —z ‡ an– … zn ‡ —a1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ an–zn−1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ X i1<\u0001\u0001\u0001<ik ai1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 aik zn−k ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ a1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 an we see that, dividing through by an and letting an approach 1 , this polynomial approaches zn−1 ‡ —a1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ an−1–zn−2 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ a1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 an−1 … —z ‡ a1– \u0001\u0001\u0001 —z ‡ an−1– . The same argument would apply if several ai ’s approach 1 simultaneously. The value f—a1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;an– is unchanged under permutation of the ai ’s, so there is an induced map SPn—S 2–!CPn which is a continuous bijection, hence a homeo- morphism since both spaces are compact Hausdorff. Letting n go to 1 , we then get a homeomorphism SP —S 2– ˇ CP1 . The same argument can be used to show that SPn—S 1– ' S 1 for all n , including n …1 . Namely, the argument shows that SPn—C −f0g– can be identiﬁed with the 482 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory polynomials zn ‡ an−1zn−1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ a0 with a0 ﬂ 0 , or in other words, the n tuples —a0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;an−1– 2 C n with a0 ﬂ 0 , and this subspace of C n deformation retracts onto a circle. The symmetric products of higher-dimensional spheres are more complicated, though things are not so bad for the 2 fold symmetric product: Example 4K.5. Let us show that SP2—S n– is homeomorphic to the mapping cone of a map ÖnRPn−1!S n . Hence H\u0003—SP2—S n–– ˇ H\u0003—S n–\b eH\u0003—Ön‡1RPn−1– from the long exact sequence of homology groups for the pair —SP2—S n–; S n– , since SP2—S n–=S n is Ön‡1RPn−1 with no reduced homology below dimension n ‡ 2. If we view S n as Dn=@Dn , then SP2—S n– becomes a certain quotient of Dn \u0002 Dn . Viewing Dn \u0002 Dn as the cone on its boundary Dn \u0002 @Dn [@Dn \u0002 Dn , the identiﬁcations that produce SP2—S n– respect the various concentric copies of this boundary which ﬁll up the interior of Dn \u0002 Dn , so it sufﬁces to analyze the identiﬁcations in all these copies of the boundary. The identiﬁcations on the boundary of Dn \u0002 Dn itself yield S n . This is clear since the identiﬁcation —x; y– ˘ —y; x– converts Dn \u0002 @Dn[@Dn \u0002 Dn to Dn \u0002 @Dn , and all points of @Dn are identiﬁed in S n . It remains to see that the identiﬁcations —x; y– ˘ —y; x– on each concentric copy of the boundary in the interior of Dn \u0002 Dn produce Ö nRPn−1 . Denote by Z the quo- tient of Dn \u0002 @Dn [ @Dn \u0002 Dn under these identiﬁcations. This is the same as the quo- tient of Dn \u0002 @Dn under the identiﬁcations —x; y– ˘ —y; x– for —x; y– 2 @Dn \u0002 @Dn . Deﬁne f : Dn \u0002 RPn−1!Z by f—x; L– … —w; z– where w and z are deﬁned as in the ﬁgure, that is, x is equidistant from z 2 @Dn and w 2 Dn along the line through x parallel to L . Note that if x happens to be the midpoint of the x z w z 0 L 0 segment zz0 , then w … z0 and there is no way to distinguish between w and z , but since f takes values in the quotient space Z , this is not a problem. If x 2 @Dn then w … z … x , independent of L .If x 2 Dn −@Dn then w ﬂ z , and conversely, given —w; z– 2 Dn \u0002 @Dn with w ﬂ z there is a unique —x; L– with f—x; L– … —w; z– , namely x is the midpoint of the segment wz and L is the line parallel to this segment. In view of these remarks, we see that Z is the quotient space of Dn \u0002 RPn−1 under the identiﬁcations —x; L– ˘ —x; L 0– if x 2 @Dn . This quotient is precisely Ö nRPn−1 . This example illustrates that passing from a CW structure on X to a CW structure on SPn—X– or SP —X– is not at all straightforward. However, if X is a simplicial com- plex, there is a natural way of putting Ñ complex structures on SPn—X– and SP —X– , as follows. A simplicial complex structure on X gives a CW structure on the prod- uct of n copies of X , with cells n fold products of simplices. Such a product has a canonical barycentric subdivision as a simplicial complex, with vertices the points whose coordinates are barycenters of simplices of X . By induction over skeleta, this The Dold–Thom Theorem Section 4.K 483 just amounts to coning off a simplicial structure on the boundary of each product cell. This simplicial structure on the product of n copies of X is in fact a Ñ complex structure since the vertices of each of its simplices have a natural ordering given by the dimensions of the cells of which they are barycenters. The action of the symmet- ric group permuting coordinates respects this Ñ complex structure, taking simplices homeomorphically to simplices, preserving vertex-orderings, so there is an induced Ñ complex structure on the quotient SPn—X– . With the basepoint of X chosen to be a vertex, SPn—X– is a subcomplex of SPn‡1—X– so there is a natural Ñ complex structure on the inﬁnite symmetric product SP —X– as well. As usual with products, the CW topology on SPn—X– and SP —X– is in general different from the topology arising from the original deﬁnition in terms of product topologies, but one can check that the two topologies have the same compact sets, so the distinction will not matter for our present purposes. For deﬁniteness, we will use the CW topology in what follows, which means restricting X to be a simplicial complex. Since every CW complex is homotopy equivalent to a simplicial complex by Theorem 2C.5, and SPn and SP are homotopy functors, there is no essential loss of generality in restricting from CW complexes to simplicial complexes. Here is the main result of this section, the Dold–Thom theorem: Theorem 4K.6. The functor X , ˇiSP —X– for i \u0015 1 coincides with the functor X , Hi—X; Z– on the category of basepointed connected CW complexes. In particular this says that SP —S n– is a K—Z;n– , and more generally that for a Moore space M—G; n– , SP —M—G; n–– is a K—G; n– . The fact that SP —X– is a commutative, associative H–space with a strict identity element limits its weak homotopy type considerably: Corollary 4K.7. A path-connected, commutative, associative H–space with a strict identity element has the weak homotopy type of a product of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces. In particular, if X is a connected CW complex then SP —X– is path-connected and has the weak homotopy type of Q n K—Hn—X–; n– . Thus the functor SP essentially reduces to Eilenberg–MacLane spaces. Proof: Let X be a path-connected, commutative, associative H–space with a strict identity element, and let Gn … ˇn—X– . By Lemma 4.31 there is a map M—Gn;n–!X inducing an isomorphism on ˇn when n> 1 and an isomorphism on H1 when n … 1 . We can take these maps to be basepoint-preserving, and then they com- bine to give a map W n M—Gn;n–!X . The very special H–space structure on X al- lows us to extend this to a homomorphism f : SP — W n M( Gn;n–\u0001 !X . In general, SP — W \u000b X\u000b– can be identiﬁed with Q \u000b SP —X\u000b– where this is the ‘weak’ inﬁnite prod- uct, the union of the ﬁnite products. This, together with the general fact that the map 484 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory ˇi—X–!ˇiSP —X– … Hi—X; Z– induced by the inclusion X … SP1—X– > SP —X– is the Hurewicz homomorphism, as we will see at the end of the proof of the Dold–Thom the- orem, implies that the map f induces an isomorphism on all homotopy groups. Thus we have a weak homotopy equivalence Q n SP ( M—Gn;n–\u0001 !X , and as we noted above, SP ( M—Gn;n–\u0001 is a K—Gn;n– . Finally, since each factor SP ( M—Gn;n–\u0001 has only one nontrivial homotopy group, the weak inﬁnite product has the same weak homotopy type as the ordinary inﬁnite product. tu The main step in the proof of the theorem will be to show that for a simplicial pair —X; A– with both X and A connected, there is a long exact sequence \u0001\u0001\u0001 !ˇiSP —A–!ˇiSP —X–!ˇiSP —X=A–!ˇi−1SP —A–! \u0001\u0001\u0001 This would follow if the maps SP —A–!SP —X–!SP —X=A– formed a ﬁber bundle or ﬁbration. There is some reason to think this might be true, because all the ﬁbers of the projection SP —X–!SP —X=A– are homeomorphic to SP —A– . In fact, in terms of the H–space structure on SP —X– as the free abelian monoid generated by X , the ﬁbers are exactly the cosets of the submonoid SP —A– . The projection SP —X–!SP —X=A– , however, fails to have the homotopy lifting property, even the special case of lifting paths. For if xt , t 2 ƒ0; 1– , is a path in X − A approaching a point x1 … a 2 A other than the basepoint, then regarding xt as a path in SP —X=A– , any lift to SP —X– would have the form xt\u000bt , \u000bt 2 SP —A– , ending at x1\u000b1 … a\u000b1 , a point of SP —A– which is a multiple of a , so in particular there would be no lift ending at the basepoint of SP —X– . What we will show is that the projection SP —X–!SP —X=A– has instead the weaker structure of a quasiﬁbration, which is still good enough to deduce a long exact se- quence of homotopy groups. Proof of 4K.6: As we have said, the main step will be to associate a long exact sequence of homotopy groups to each simplicial pair —X; A– with X and A connected. This will be the long exact sequence of homotopy groups coming from the quasiﬁbration SP —A–!SP —X–!SP —X=A– , so the major work will be in verifying the quasiﬁbration property. Since SP is a homotopy functor, we are free to replace —X; A– by a homotopy equivalent pair, so let us replace —X; A– by —M; A– where M is the mapping cylinder of the inclusion A > X . This new pair, which we still call —X; A– , has some slight technical advantages, as we will see later in the proof. To begin the proof that the projection p : SP —X–!SP —X=A– is a quasiﬁbration, let Bn … SPn—X=A– and En … p−1—Bn– . Thus En consists of those points in SP —X– having at most n coordinates in X − A . By Lemma 4K.3(b) it sufﬁces to show that p : En!Bn is a quasiﬁbration. The proof of the latter fact will be by induction on n , starting with the trivial case n … 0 when B0 is a point. The induction step will consist of showing that p is a quasiﬁbration over a neighborhood of Bn−1 and over The Dold–Thom Theorem Section 4.K 485 Bn − Bn−1 , then applying Lemma 4K.3(a). We ﬁrst tackle the problem of showing the quasiﬁbration property over a neighborhood of Bn−1 . Let ft : X!X be a homotopy of the identity map deformation retracting a neigh- borhood N of A onto A . Since we have replaced the original X by the mapping cylinder of the inclusion A > X , we can take ft simply to slide points along the seg- ments fag\u0002 I in the mapping cylinder, with N … A\u0002 ƒ0; 1=2–. Let U ˆ En consist of those points having at least one coordinate in N , or in other words, products with at least one factor in N . Thus U is a neighborhood of En−1 in En and p—U – is a neighborhood of Bn−1 in Bn . The homotopy ft induces a homotopy Ft : En!En whose restriction to U is a de- formation of U into En−1 , where by ‘deformation’ we mean deformation retraction in the weak sense. Since ft is the identity on A , Ft is the lift of a homotopy F t : Bn!Bn which restricts to a deformation of U … p—U – into Bn−1 . We will deduce that the projection U!U is a quasiﬁbration by using Lemma 4K.3(c). To apply this to the case at hand we need to verify that F1 : p−1—b–!p−1( F 1—b– \u0001 is a weak equivalence for all b . Each point w 2 p−1—b– is a commuting product of points in X . Let cw be the subproduct whose factors are points in X − A , so we have w … cwv for v a product of points in A . Since f1 is the identity on A and F1 is a homomorphism, we have F1—w– … F1—cw–v , which can be written ÆF1—cw–v 0v with v 0 also a product of points in A . Ifweﬁx cw and let v vary over SP —A– , we get all points of p−1—b– exactly once, or in other words, we have p−1—b– expressed as the coset cwSP —A– . The map F1 , cwv , ÆF1—cw–v 0v , takes this coset to the coset ÆF1—cw–SP —A– by a map that would be a homeomorphism if the factor v 0 were not present. Since A is con- nected, there is a path v 0 t from v 0 to the basepoint, and so by replacing v 0 with v 0 t in the product ÆF1—cw–v 0v we obtain a homotopy from F1 : p−1—b–!p−1( F 1—b– \u0001 to a homeomorphism, so this map is a homotopy equivalence, as desired. It remains to see that p is a quasiﬁbration over Bn−Bn−1 and over the intersection of this set with U . The argument will be the same in both cases. Identifying Bn − Bn−1 with SPn—X − A– , the projection p : En − En−1!Bn − Bn−1 is the same as the operator w , cw . The inclusion SPn—X − A– > En − En−1 gives a section for p : En − En−1!Bn − Bn−1 ,so p\u0003 : ˇi( En − En−1;p−1—b– \u0001 !ˇi—Bn − Bn−1;b– is surjective. To see that it is also injective, represent an element of its kernel by a map g : —Di;@Di–!( En − En−1;p−1—b– \u0001 . A nullhomotopy of pg gives a homo- topy of g changing only its coordinates in X − A . This homotopy is through maps —Di;@Di–!( En − En−1;p−1—b– \u0001 , and ends with a map to p−1—b– , so the kernel of p\u0003 is trivial. Thus the projection En − En−1!Bn − Bn−1 is a quasiﬁbration, at least if Bn − Bn−1 is path-connected. But by replacing the original X with the mapping cylinder of the inclusion A > X , we guarantee that X − A is path-connected since it deformation retracts onto X . Hence the space Bn − Bn−1 … SPn—X − A– is also path-connected. 486 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory This argument works equally well over any open subset of Bn − Bn−1 that is path- connected, in particular over U \\ —Bn − Bn−1– , so via Lemma 4K.3(a) this ﬁnishes the proof that SP —A–!SP —X–!SP —X=A– is a quasiﬁbration. Since the homotopy axiom is obvious, this gives us the ﬁrst two of the three ax- ioms needed for the groups hi—X– … ˇiSP —X– to deﬁne a reduced homology theory. There remains only the wedge sum axiom, hi—W \u000b X\u000b– ˇ L \u000b hi—X\u000b– , but this is im- mediate from the evident fact that SP — W \u000b X\u000b– … Q \u000b SP —X\u000b– , where this is the ‘weak’ product, the union of the products of ﬁnitely many factors. The homology theory h\u0003—X– is deﬁned on the category of connected, basepointed simplicial complexes, with basepoint-preserving maps. The coefﬁcients of this homol- ogy theory, the groups hi—S n– , are the same as for ordinary homology with Z coefﬁ- cients since we know this is true for n … 2 by the homeomorphism SP —S 2– ˇ CP1 , and there are isomorphisms hi—X– ˇ hi‡1—ÖX– in any reduced homology theory. If the homology theory h\u0003—X– were deﬁned on the category of all simplicial com- plexes, without basepoints, then Theorem 4.59 would give natural isomorphisms hi—X– ˇ Hi—X; Z– for all X , and the proof would be complete. However, it is easy to achieve this by deﬁning a new homology theory h 0 i—X– … hi‡1—ÖX– , since the sus- pension of an arbitrary complex is connected and the suspension of an arbitrary map is basepoint-preserving, taking the basepoint to be one of the suspension points. Since h0 i—X– is naturally isomorphic to hi—X– if X is connected, we are done. tu It is worth noting that the map ˇi—X–!ˇiSP —X– … Hi—X; Z– induced by the inclusion X … SP1—X– > SP —X– is the Hurewicz homomorphism. For by deﬁnition of the Hurewicz homomorphism and naturality this reduces to the case X … S i , where the map SP1—S i– > SP —S i– induces on ˇi a homomorphism Z!Z , which one just has to check is an isomorphism, the Hurewicz homomorphism being determined only up to sign. The suspension isomorphism gives a further reduction to the case i … 1, where the inclusion SP1—S 1– > SP —S 1– is a homotopy equivalence, hence induces an isomorphism on ˇ1 . Exercises 1.

A map p : E!B with B not necessarily path-connected is deﬁned to be a quasiﬁ- bration if the following equivalent conditions are satisﬁed: (i) For all b 2 B and x0 2 p−1—b– , the map p\u0003 : ˇi—E; p−1—b–; x0–!ˇi—B; b– is an isomorphism for i> 0 and ˇ0—p−1—b–; x0–!ˇ0—E; x0–!ˇ0—B; b– is exact. (ii) The inclusion of the ﬁber p−1—b– into the homotopy ﬁber Fb of p over b is a weak homotopy equivalence for all b 2 B . (iii) The restriction of p over each path-component of B is a quasiﬁbration according to the deﬁnition in this section. Show these three conditions are equivalent, and prove Lemma 4K.3 for quasiﬁbrations over non-pathconnected base spaces. 6. Let X be a complex of spaces over a Ñ complex Ð , as deﬁned in x4.G. Show that the natural projection ÑX!Ð is a quasiﬁbration if all the maps in X associated to edges of Ð are weak homotopy equivalences. The main objects of study in this section are certain homomorphisms called Steen- rod squares and Steenrod powers: Sqi : Hn—X; Z2–!Hn‡i—X; Z2– P i : Hn—X; Zp–!Hn‡2i—p−1–—X; Zp– for odd primes p The terms ‘squares’ and ‘powers’ arise from the fact that Sqi and P i are related to the maps \u000b, \u000b 2 and \u000b, \u000b p sending a cohomology class \u000b to the 2 fold or p fold cup product with itself. Unlike cup products, however, the operations Sqi and P i are stable, that is, invariant under suspension. The operations Sqi generate an algebra A2 , called the Steenrod algebra, such that H\u0003—X; Z2– is a module over A2 for every space X , and maps between spaces induce homomorphisms of A2 modules. Similarly, for odd primes p , H\u0003—X; Zp– is a module over a corresponding Steenrod algebra Ap generated by the P i ’s and Bockstein ho- momorphisms. Like the ring structure given by cup product, these module structures impose strong constraints on spaces and maps. For example, we will use them to show that there do not exist spaces X with H\u0003—X; Z– a polynomial ring Zƒ\u000b⁄ unless \u000b has dimension 2 or 4 , where there are the familiar examples of CP1 and HP1 . This rather lengthy section is divided into two main parts. The ﬁrst part describes the basic properties of Steenrod squares and powers and gives a number of examples and applications. The second part is devoted to constructing the squares and powers and showing they satisfy the basic properties listed in the ﬁrst part. More extensive 488 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory applications will be given in [SSAT] after spectral sequences have been introduced. Most applications of Steenrod squares and powers do not depend on how these op- erations are actually constructed, but only on their basic properties. This is similar to the situation for ordinary homology and cohomology, where the axioms generally sufﬁce for most applications. The construction of Steenrod squares and powers and the veriﬁcation of their basic properties, or axioms, is rather interesting in its own way, but does involve a certain amount of work, particularly for the Steenrod powers, and this is why we delay the work until later in the section. We begin with a few generalities. A cohomology operation is a transformation Ò … ÒX : Hm—X; G–!Hn—X; H– deﬁned for all spaces X , with a ﬁxed choice of m , n , G , and H , and satisfying the naturality property that for all maps f : X!Y there is a commuting diagram GX X H m(); HXH n();¡¡¡¡¡¡! £ GY Y H m(); HYH n();¡¡¡¡¡¡! £¡¡¡¡¡!¤f¡¡¡¡¡!¤f as shown at the right. For example, with coefﬁcients in a ring R the transformation Hm—X; R–!Hmp—X; R– , \u000b, \u000b p , is a cohomology operation since f \u0003—\u000b p– … —f \u0003—\u000b–– p . Taking R … Z , this ex- ample shows that cohomology operations need not be homomorphisms. On the other hand, when R … Zp with p prime, the operation \u000b , \u000bp is a homomorphism. Other examples of cohomology operations we have already encountered are the Bockstein homomorphisms deﬁned in x3.E. As a more trivial example, a homomorphism G!H induces change-of-coefﬁcient homomorphisms Hm—X; G–!Hm—X; H– which can be viewed as cohomology operations. In spite of their rather general deﬁnition, cohomology operations can be described in somewhat more concrete terms: Proposition 4L.1. For ﬁxed m , n , G , and H there is a bijection between the set of all cohomology operations Ò : Hm—X; G–!Hn—X; H– and Hn—K—G; m–; H– , deﬁned by Ò , Ò—\u0013– where \u0013 2 Hm—K—G; m–; G– is a fundamental class. Proof: Via CW approximations to spaces, it sufﬁces to restrict attention to CW com- plexes, so we can identify Hm—X; G– with hX; K—G; m–i as in Theorem 4.57. If an element \u000b 2 Hm—X; G– corresponds to a map ' : X!K—G; m– ,so '\u0003—\u0013– … \u000b , then Ò—\u000b– … Ò—'\u0003—\u0013–– … '\u0003—Ò—\u0013–– and Ò is uniquely determined by Ò—\u0013– . Thus Ò , Ò—\u0013– is injective. For surjectivity, given an element \u000b 2 Hn—K—G; m–; H– corresponding to a map \u0012 : K—G; m–!K—H; n– , then composing with \u0012 deﬁnes a transformation hX; K—G; m–i!hX; K—H; n–i , that is, Ò : Hm—X; G–!Hn—X; H– , with Ò—\u0013– … \u000b . The naturality property for Ò amounts to associativity of the compositions X f -----! Y ' -----! K—G; m– \u0012-----! K—H; n– and so Ò is a cohomology operation. tu A consequence of the proposition is that cohomology operations cannot decrease dimension, since K—G; m– is —m − 1– connected. Moreover, since Hm—K—G; m–; H– ˇ Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 489 Hom—G; H– , it follows that the only cohomology operations that preserve dimension are given by coefﬁcient homomorphisms. The Steenrod squares Sqi : Hn—X; Z2–!Hn‡i—X; Z2– , i \u0015 0 , will satisfy the fol- lowing list of properties, beginning with naturality: (1) Sqi—f \u0003—\u000b–– … f \u0003—Sqi—\u000b–– for f : X!Y . (2) Sqi—\u000b ‡ \f– … Sqi—\u000b– ‡ Sqi—\f– . (3) Sqi—\u000b ` \f– … P j Sqj—\u000b– ` Sqi−j—\f– (the Cartan formula). (4) Sqi—˙ —\u000b–– … ˙—Sqi—\u000b–– where ˙ : Hn—X; Z2–!Hn‡1—ÖX; Z2– is the suspension isomorphism given by reduced cross product with a generator of H1—S 1; Z2– . (5) Sqi—\u000b– … \u000b 2 if i …j\u000bj , and Sqi—\u000b– … 0if i> j\u000bj . (6) Sq0 … 11 , the identity. (7) Sq1 is the Z2 Bockstein homomorphism \f associated with the coefﬁcient se- quence 0!Z2!Z4!Z2!0. The ﬁrst part of (5) says that the Steenrod squares extend the squaring operation \u000b , \u000b 2 , which has the nice feature of being a homomorphism with Z2 coefﬁcients. Property (4) says that the Sqi ’s are stable operations, invariant under suspension. The actual squaring operation \u000b , \u000b 2 does not have this property since in a suspension ÖX all cup products of positive-dimensional classes are zero, according to an exercise for x3.2. The fact that Steenrod squares are stable operations extending the cup product square yields the following theorem, which implies that the stable homotopy groups of spheres ˇ s 1 , ˇ s 3 , and ˇ s 7 are nontrivial: Theorem 4L.2. If f : S 2n−1!S n has Hopf invariant 1 , then ƒf ⁄ 2 ˇ s n−1 is nonzero, so the iterated suspensions Ökf : S 2n‡k−1!S n‡k are all homotopically nontrivial. Proof: Associated to a map f : S `!S m is the mapping cone Cf … S m [f e`‡1 with the cell e`‡1 attached via f . Assuming f is basepoint-preserving, we have the relation CÖf … ÖCf where Ö denotes reduced suspension. If f : S 2n−1!S n has Hopf invariant 1 , then by (5), Sqn : Hn—Cf ; Z2–!H2n—Cf ; Z2– is nontrivial. By (4) the same is true for Sqn : Hn‡k—ÖkCf ; Z2–!H2n‡k—Ö kCf ; Z2– for all k .If Ökf were homotopically trivial we would have a retraction r : Ö kCf !S n‡k . The diagram at the right would then commute by¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!S r Sq H (); 2 n k+ n k+ 2 ¤ ¼ §Z CH (); 2 n k+ k n¡¡¡¡¡!Sq n f Z ¡¡¡¡¡!S r H (); 2 n k+ 2n k+n k+ ¤ §Z CH (); 2 k f Z naturality of Sqn , but since the group in the lower left corner of the diagram is zero, this gives a contradiction. tu The Steenrod power operations P i : Hn—X; Zp–!Hn‡2i—p−1–—X; Zp– for p an odd prime will satisfy analogous properties: (1) P i—f \u0003—\u000b–– … f \u0003—P i—\u000b–– for f : X!Y . 490 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory (2) P i—\u000b ‡ \f– … P i—\u000b– ‡ P i—\f– . (3) P i—\u000b ` \f– … P j P j—\u000b– ` P i−j—\f– (the Cartan formula). (4) P i—˙ —\u000b–– … ˙—P i—\u000b–– where ˙ : Hn—X; Zp–!Hn‡1—ÖX; Zp– is the suspension iso- morphism given by reduced cross product with a generator of H1—S 1; Zp– . (5) P i—\u000b– … \u000b p if 2i …j\u000bj , and P i—\u000b– … 0if2i> j\u000bj . (6) P 0 … 11 , the identity. The germinal property P i—\u000b– … \u000bp in (5) can only be expected to hold for even- dimensional classes \u000b since for odd-dimensional \u000b the commutativity property of cup product implies that \u000b 2 … 0 with Zp coefﬁcients if p is odd, and then \u000b p … 0 since \u000b2 … 0 . Note that the formula P i—\u000b– … \u000b p for j\u000bj… 2i implies that P i raises dimension by 2i—p − 1– , explaining the appearance of this number. The Bockstein homomorphism \f : Hn—X; Zp–!Hn‡1—X; Zp– is not included as one of the P i ’s, but this is mainly a matter of notational convenience. As we shall see later when we discuss Adem relations, the operation Sq2i‡1 is the same as the composition Sq1Sq2i … \fSq2i ,sothe Sq2i ’s can be regarded as the P i ’s for p … 2. One might ask if there are elements of ˇ s \u0003 detectable by Steenrod powers in the same way that the Hopf maps are detected by Steenrod squares. The answer is yes for the operation P 1 , as we show in Example 4L.6. It is a perhaps disappointing fact that no other squares or powers besides Sq1 , Sq2 , Sq4 , Sq8 , and P 1 detect elements of homotopy groups of spheres. ( Sq1 detects a map S n!S n of degree 2 .) We will prove this for certain Sqi ’s and P i ’s later in this section. The general case for p … 2 is Adams’ theorem on the Hopf invariant discussed in x4.B, while the case of odd p is proved in [Adams & Atiyah 1966]; see also [VBKT]. The Cartan formulas can be expressed in a more concise form by deﬁning total Steenrod square and power operations by Sq … Sq0 ‡ Sq1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 and P … P 0 ‡ P 1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 . These act on H\u0003—X; Zp– since by property (5), only a ﬁnite number of Sqi ’s or P i ’s can be nonzero on a given cohomology class. The Cartan formulas then say that Sq—\u000b ` \f– … Sq—\u000b– ` Sq—\f– and P—\u000b ` \f– … P —\u000b– ` P —\f– ,so Sq and P are ring homomorphisms. We can use Sq and P to compute the operations Sqi and P i for projective spaces and lens spaces via the following general formulas: —\u0003– Sqi—\u000b n– … \u0010 n i \u0011\u000bn‡i for \u000b 2 H1—X; Z2– P i—\u000b n– … \u0010 n i \u0011\u000bn‡i—p−1– for \u000b 2 H2—X; Zp– To derive the ﬁrst formula, properties (5) and (6) give Sq—\u000b– … \u000b ‡ \u000b2 … \u000b—1 ‡ \u000b– , so Sq—\u000bn– … Sq—\u000b– n … \u000b n—1 ‡ \u000b– n … P i \u0010 n i \u0011\u000b n‡i and hence Sqi—\u000b n– … \u0010 n i \u0011\u000b n‡i . The second formula is obtained in similar fashion: P —\u000b– … \u000b ‡ \u000bp … \u000b—1 ‡ \u000bp−1– so P—\u000bn– … \u000b n—1 ‡ \u000bp−1–n … P i \u0010 n i \u0011\u000b n‡i—p−1– . Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 491 In Lemma 3C.6 we described how binomial coefﬁcients can be computed modulo a prime p : \u0010m n \u0011 \u0011 Q i \u0010 mi ni \u0011 mod p , where m … Pi mipi and n … P i nipi are the p adic expansions of m and n . When p … 2 for example, the extreme cases of a dyadic expansion consisting of a single 1 or all 1 ’s give Sq—\u000b2k – … \u000b 2k ‡ \u000b2k‡1 Sq—\u000b 2k−1– … \u000b 2k−1 ‡ \u000b2k ‡ \u000b2k‡1 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ \u000b 2k‡1−2 for \u000b 2 H1—X; Z2– .

Example 4L.3: Stable Splittings. The formula —\u0003– tells us how to compute Steen- rod squares for RP1 , hence also for any suspension of RP1 . The explicit formu- las for Sq—\u000b2k – and Sq—\u000b2k−1– above show that all the powers of the generator \u000b 2 H1—RP1; Z2– are tied together by Steenrod squares since the ﬁrst formula con- nects \u000b inductively to all the powers \u000b 2k and the second formula connects these powers to all the other powers. This shows that no suspension Ö kRP1 has the ho- motopy type of a wedge sum X _ Y with both X and Y having nontrivial cohomol- ogy. In the case of RP1 itself we could have deduced this from the ring structure of H\u0003—RP1; Z2– ˇ Z2ƒ\u000b⁄ , but cup products become trivial in a suspension. The same reasoning shows that CP1 and HP1 have no nontrivial stable split- tings. The Z2 cohomology in these cases is again Z2ƒ\u000b⁄ , though with \u000b no longer 1 dimensional. However, we still have Sq—\u000b– … \u000b ‡ \u000b 2 since these spaces have no nontrivial cohomology in the dimensions between \u000b and \u000b 2 , so we have Sq2i—\u000bn– …\u0010n i \u0011\u000b n‡i for CP1 and Sq4i—\u000b n– … \u0010 n i \u0011\u000bn‡i for HP1 . Then the arguments from the real case carry over using the operations Sq2i and Sq4i in place of Sqi . Suppose we consider the same question for K—Z3; 1– instead of RP1 . Taking cohomology with Z3 coefﬁcients, the Bockstein \f is nonzero on odd-dimensional classes in H\u0003—K—Z3; 1–; Z3– , thus tying them to the even-dimensional classes, so we only need to see which even-dimensional classes are connected by P i ’s. The even- dimensional part of H\u0003—K—Z3; 1–; Z3– is a polynomial algebra Z3ƒ\u000b⁄ with j\u000bj… 2, so we have P i—\u000b n– … \u0010 n i \u0011\u000b n‡i—p−1– … \u0010 n i \u0011\u000b n‡2i by our earlier formula. Since P i raises dimension by 4i when p … 3 , there is no chance that all the even-dimensional co- homology will be connected by the P i ’s. In fact, we showed in Proposition 4I.3 that ÖK—Z3; 1– ' X1 _ X2 where X1 has the cohomology of ÖK—Z3; 1– in dimensions con- gruent to 2 and 3 mod 4 , while X2 has the remaining cohomology. Thus the best one could hope would be that all the odd powers of \u000b are connected by P i ’s and likewise all the even powers are connected, since this would imply that neither X1 nor X2 splits 492 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory nontrivially. This is indeed the case, as one sees by an exam- ination of the coefﬁcients in the formula P i—\u000b n– … \u0010 n i \u0011\u000bn‡2i . In the Pascal triangle mod 3 , shown at the right, P—\u000bn– is de- 11122111 1112111 121121 11111 1111 121 11 1 . .. . .. . .. 1121212121.. . ... . . 1 termined by the —n ‡ 1– st row. For example the sixth row says that P—\u000b 5– … \u000b5 ‡ 2\u000b7 ‡ \u000b9 ‡ \u000b11 ‡ 2\u000b13 ‡ \u000b15 . A few moments’ thought shows that the rows that compute P—\u000bn– for n … 3km − 1 have all nonzero entries, and these rows together with the rows right after them sufﬁce to connect the powers of \u000b in the desired way, so X1 and X2 have no stable splittings. One can also see that Ö2X1 and X2 are not homotopy equivalent, even stably, since the operations P i act differently in the two spaces. For example P 2 is trivial on suspensions of \u000b but not on suspensions of \u000b 2 . The situation for K—Zp; 1– for larger primes p is entirely similar, with ÖK—Zp; 1– splitting as a wedge sum of p − 1 spaces. The same arguments work more generally for K—Zpi ; 1– , though for i> 1 the usual Bockstein \f is identically zero so one has to use instead a Bockstein involving Zpi coefﬁcients. We leave the details of these arguments as exercises. Example 4L.4: Maps of HP1 . We can use the operations P i together with a bit of number theory to demonstrate an interesting distinction between HP1 and CP1 , namely, we will show that if a map f : HP1!HP1 has f \u0003—γ– … dγ for γ a generator of H4—HP1; Z– , then the integer d , which we call the degree of f , must be a square. By contrast, since CP1 is a K—Z; 2– , there are maps CP1!CP1 carrying a generator \u000b 2 H2—CP1; Z– onto any given multiple of itself. Explicitly, the map z , zd , z 2 C , induces a map f of CP1 with f \u0003—\u000b– … d\u000b , but commutativity of C is needed for this construction so it does not extend to the quaternionic case. We shall deduce the action of Steenrod powers on H\u0003—HP1; Zp– from their ac- tion on H\u0003—CP1; Zp– , given by the earlier formula —\u0003– which says that P i—\u000b n– …\u0010n i \u0011\u000b n‡i—p−1– for \u000b a generator of H2—CP1; Zp– . There is a natural quotient map CP1!HP1 arising from the deﬁnition of both spaces as quotients of S 1 . This map takes the 4 cell of CP1 homeomorphically onto the 4 cell of HP1 , so the induced map on cohomology sends a generator γ 2 H4—HP1; Zp– to \u000b 2 , hence γn to \u000b 2n . Thus the formula P i—\u000b 2n– … \u00102n i \u0011\u000b2n‡i—p−1– implies that P i—γn– … \u00102n i \u0011γn‡i—p−1–=2 . For example, P 1—γ– … 2γ—p‡1–=2 . Now let f : HP1!HP1 be any map. Applying the formula P 1—γ– … 2γ—p‡1–=2 in two ways, we get P 1f \u0003—γ– … f \u0003P 1—γ– … f \u0003—2γ—p‡1–=2– … 2d —p‡1–=2γ—p‡1–=2 and P 1f \u0003—γ– … P 1—dγ– … 2dγ—p‡1–=2 Hence the degree d satisﬁes d —p‡1–=2 \u0011 d mod p for all odd primes p . Thus either d \u0011 0 mod p or d—p−1–=2 \u0011 1 mod p . In both cases d is a square mod p since the Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 493 congruence d —p−1–=2 \u0011 1 mod p is equivalent to d being a nonzero square mod p , the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of the ﬁeld Zp being cyclic of order p − 1. The argument is completed by appealing to the number theory fact that an integer which is a square mod p for all sufﬁciently large primes p must be a square. This can be deduced from quadratic reciprocity and Dirichlet’s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions as follows. Suppose on the contrary that the result is false for the integer d . Consider primes p not dividing d . Since the product of two squares in Zp is again a square, we may assume that d is a product of distinct primes q1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;qn , where one of these primes is allowed to be −1if d is negative. In terms of the Legendre symbol ( d p \u0001 which is deﬁned to be ‡1if d is a square mod p and −1 otherwise, we have \u0012 d p \u0013 … \u0012 q1 p \u0013 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0012 qn p \u0013 The left side is ‡1 for all large p by hypothesis, so it will sufﬁce to see that p can be chosen to give each term on the right an arbitrary preassigned value. The values of ( −1 p \u0001 and ( 2 p \u0001 depend only on p mod 8 , and the four combinations of values are real- ized by the four residues 1; 3; 5; 7 mod 8 . Having speciﬁed the value of p mod 8 , the quadratic reciprocity law then says that for odd primes q , specifying ( q p \u0001 is equiva- lent to specifying ( p q \u0001 . Thus we need only choose p in the appropriate residue classes mod 8 and mod qi for each odd qi . By the Chinese remainder theorem, this means specifying p modulo 8 times a product of odd primes. Dirichlet’s theorem guarantees that in fact inﬁnitely many primes p exist satisfying this congruence condition. It is known that the integers realizable as degrees of maps HP1!HP1 are exactly the odd squares and zero. The construction of maps of odd square degree will be given in [SSAT] using localization techniques, following [Sullivan 1974]. Ruling out nonzero even squares can be done using K–theory; see [Feder & Gitler 1978], which also treats maps HPn!HPn . The preceding calculations can also be used to show that every map HPn!HPn must have a ﬁxed point if n> 1 . For, taking p … 3 , the element P 1—γ– lies in H8—HPn; Z3– which is nonzero if n> 1 , so, when the earlier argument is specialized to the case p … 3 , the congruence d —p‡1–=2 \u0011 d mod p becomes d 2 … d in Z3 , which is satisﬁed only by 0 and 1 in Z3 . Hence f \u0003 : eH\u0003—HPn; Z3–! eH\u0003—HPn; Z3– is either zero or the identity. In both cases the Lefschetz number \u0015—f – , which is the sum of the traces of the maps f \u0003 : H4i—HPn; Z3–!H4i—HPn; Z3– , is nonzero, so the Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem gives the result. Example 4L.5: Vector Fields on Spheres. Let us now apply Steenrod squares to determine the maximum number of orthonormal tangent vector ﬁelds on a sphere in all cases except when the dimension of the sphere is congruent to −1 mod 16 . The ﬁrst step is to rephrase the question in terms of Stiefel manifolds. Recall from the end of x3.D and Example 4.53 the space Vn;k of orthonormal k frames in R n . Projection of a k frame onto its ﬁrst vector gives a map p : Vn;k!S n−1 , and a section 494 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory for this projection, that is, a map f : S n−1!Vn;k such that pf … 11 , is exactly a set of k − 1 orthonormal tangent vector ﬁelds v1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk−1 on S n−1 since f assigns to each x 2 S n−1 an orthonormal k frame —x; v1—x–; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vk−1—x–– . We described a cell structure on Vn;k at the end of x3.D, and we claim that the —n − 1– skeleton of this cell structure is RPn−1=RPn−k−1 if 2k − 1 \u0014 n . The cells of Vn;k were products ei1 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 eim with n>i1 > \u0001\u0001\u0001 >im \u0015 n − k , so the products with a single factor account for all of the —2n − 2k– skeleton, hence they account for all of the —n − 1– skeleton if n − 1 \u0014 2n − 2k , that is, if 2k − 1 \u0014 n . The cells that are products with a single factor are the homeomorphic images of cells of RPn−1 under a map RPn−1!SO—n–!SO—n–=SO—n − k– … Vn;k . This map collapses RPn−k−1 to a point, so we get the desired conclusion that RPn−1=RPn−k−1 is the —n − 1– skeleton of Vn;k if 2k − 1 \u0014 n . Now suppose we have f : S n−1!Vn;k with pf … 11 . In particular, f \u0003 is surjective on Hn−1—−; Z2– . If we deform f to a cellular map, with image in the —n − 1– skeleton, then by the preceding paragraph this will give a map g : S n−1!RPn−1=RPn−k−1 if 2k − 1 \u0014 n , and this map will still induce a surjection on Hn−1—−; Z2– , hence an isomorphism. If the number k happens to be such that \u0010n−k k−1\u0011 \u0011 1 mod 2 , then by the earlier formula —\u0003– the operation Sqk−1 : Hn−k—RPn−1=RPn−k−1; Z2–!Hn−1—RPn−1=RPn−k−1; Z2– will be nonzero, contradicting the existence of the map g since obviously the opera- tion Sqk−1 : Hn−k—S n−1; Z2–!Hn−1—S n−1; Z2– is zero. In order to guarantee that \u0010n−k k−1\u0011 \u0011 1 mod 2 , write n … 2 r —2s ‡ 1– and choose k … 2r ‡ 1 . Assume for the moment that s \u0015 1 . Then \u0010 n−k k−1\u0011 … \u00102r ‡1s−1 2r \u0011 , and in view of the rule for computing binomial coefﬁcients in Z2 , this is nonzero since the dyadic expansion of 2r ‡1s − 1 ends with a string of 1 ’s including a 1 in the single digit where the expansion of 2 r is nonzero. Note that the earlier condition 2k − 1 \u0014 n is satisﬁed since it becomes 2 r ‡1 ‡ 1 \u0014 2 r ‡1s ‡ 2r and we assume s \u0015 1. Summarizing, we have shown that for n … 2 r —2s ‡ 1– , the sphere S n−1 cannot have 2r orthonormal tangent vector ﬁelds if s \u0015 1 . This is also trivially true for s … 0 since S n−1 cannot have n orthonormal tangent vector ﬁelds. It is easy to see that this result is best possible when r \u0014 3 by explicitly construct- ing 2r − 1 orthonormal tangent vector ﬁelds on S n−1 when n … 2r m . When r … 1, view S n−1 as the unit sphere in C m , and then x , ix deﬁnes a tangent vector ﬁeld since the unit complex numbers 1 and i are orthogonal and multiplication by a unit complex number is an isometry of C ,so x and ix are orthogonal in each coordinate of Cm , hence are orthogonal. When r … 2 the same construction works with H in place of C , using the maps x,ix , x,jx , and x,kx to deﬁne three orthonormal tangent vector ﬁelds on the unit sphere in Hm . When r … 3 we can follow the same Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 495 procedure with the octonions, constructing seven orthonormal tangent vector ﬁelds to the unit sphere in O m via an orthonormal basis 1;i;j;k; \u0001\u0001\u0001 for O . The upper bound of 2r − 1 for the number of orthonormal vector ﬁelds on S n−1 is not best possible in the remaining case n \u0011 0 mod 16 . The optimal upper bound is obtained instead using K–theory; see [VBKT] or [Husemoller 1966]. The construction of the requisite number of vector ﬁelds is again algebraic, this time using Clifford algebras. Example 4L.6: A Map of mod p Hopf Invariant One. Let us describe a construction for a map f : S 2p!S 3 such that in the mapping cone Cf … S 3 [f e2p‡1 , the ﬁrst Steen- rod power P 1 : H3—Cf ; Zp–!H2p‡1—Cf ; Zp– is nonzero, hence f is nonzero in ˇ s 2p−3 . The construction starts with the fact that a generator of H2—K—Zp; 1–; Zp– has nontriv- ial p th power, so the operation P 1 : H2—K—Zp; 1–; Zp–!H2p—K—Zp; 1–; Zp– is nontrivial by property (5). This remains true after we suspend to ÖK—Zp; 1– , and we showed in Proposition 4I.3 that ÖK—Zp; 1– has the homotopy type of a wedge sum of CW com- plexes Xi ,1 \u0014 i \u0014 p − 1 , with eH\u0003—Xi; Z– consisting only of a Zp in each dimension congruent to 2i mod 2p − 2 . We are interested here in the space X … X1 , which has nontrivial Zp cohomology in dimensions 2; 3; 2p; 2p ‡ 1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 . Since X is, up to homo- topy, a wedge summand of ÖK—Zp; 1– , the operation P 1 : H3—X; Zp–!H2p‡1—X; Zp– is nontrivial. Since X is simply-connected, the construction in x4.C shows that we may take X to have —2p ‡ 1– skeleton of the form S 2 [ e3 [ e2p [ e2p‡1 . In fact, using the notion of homology decomposition in x4.H, we can take this skeleton to be the reduced mapping cone Cg of a map of Moore spaces g : M—Zp; 2p − 1–!M—Zp; 2– . It follows that the quotient Cg=S 2 is the reduced mapping cone of the composition h : M—Zp; 2p − 1– g -----! M—Zp; 2–!M—Zp; 2–=S 2 … S 3 . The restriction h jj S 2p−1 repre- sents an element of ˇ2p−1—S 3– that is either trivial or has order p since this restriction extends over the 2p cell of M—Zp; 2p − 1– which is attached by a map S 2p−1!S 2p−1 of degree p . In fact, h jj S 2p−1 is nullhomotopic since, as we will see in [SSAT] using the Serre spectral sequence, ˇi—S 3– contains no elements of order p if i \u0014 2p − 1. This implies that the space Ch … Cg=S 2 is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex Y obtained from S 3 _ S 2p by attaching a cell e2p‡1 . The quotient Y=S 2p then has the form S 3 [ e2p‡1 , so it is the mapping cone of a map f : S 2p!S 3 . By construction there is a map Cg!Cf inducing an isomorphism on Zp cohomology in dimensions 3 and 2p ‡ 1 , so the operation P 1 is nontrivial in H\u0003—Cf ; Zp– since this was true for Cg , the —2p ‡ 1– skeleton of X . Example 4L.7: Moore Spaces. Let us use the operation Sq2 to show that for n \u0015 2, the identity map of M—Z2;n– has order 4 in the group of basepoint-preserving homo- topy classes of maps M—Z2;n–!M—Z2;n– , with addition deﬁned via the suspension structure on M—Z2;n– … ÖM—Z2;n − 1– . According to Proposition 4H.2, this group is the middle term of a short exact sequence, the remaining terms of which contain only 496 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory elements of order 2 . Hence if the identity map of M—Z2;n– has order 4 , this short exact sequence cannot split. In view of the short exact sequence just referred to, it will sufﬁce to show that twice the identity map of M—Z2;n– is not nullhomotopic. If twice the identity were nullhomotopic, then the mapping cone C of this map would have the homotopy type of M—Z2;n– _ ÖM—Z2;n– . This would force Sq2 : Hn—C; Z2–!Hn‡2—C; Z2– to be trivial since the source and target groups would come from different wedge summands. However, we will now show that this Sq2 operation is nontrivial. Twice the identity map of M—Z2;n– can be regarded as the smash product of the degree 2 map S 1!S 1 , z , z2 , with the identity map of M—Z2;n − 1– . If we smash the coﬁbration sequence S 1!S 1!RP2 for this degree 2 map with M—Z2;n − 1– we get the coﬁber sequence M—Z2;n–!M—Z2;n–!C , in view of the identity —X=A– ^ Y … —X ^ Y –=—A ^ Y– . This means we can view C as RP2 ^ M—Z2;n − 1– . The Cartan formula translated to cross products gives Sq2—\u000b\u0002 \f– … Sq0\u000b\u0002 Sq2\f‡Sq1\u000b\u0002 Sq1\f‡Sq2\u000b\u0002 Sq0\f . This holds for smash products as well as ordinary products, by naturality. Taking \u000b to be a generator of H1—RP2; Z2– and \f a generator of Hn−1—M—Z2;n − 1–; Z2– , we have Sq2\u000b … 0 … Sq2\f , but Sq1\u000b and Sq1\f are nonzero since Sq1 is the Bockstein. By the K¨unneth formula, Sq1\u000b\u0002 Sq1\f then generates Hn‡2—RP2 ^ M—Z2;n − 1–; Z2– and we are done. Adem Relations and the Steenrod Algebra When Steenrod squares or powers are composed, the compositions satisfy certain relations, unfortunately rather complicated, known as Adem relations: SqaSqb … X j \u0010b−j−1 a−2j \u0011Sqa‡b−jSqj if a< 2b P aP b … X j—−1– a‡j\u0010—p−1–—b−j–−1 a−pj \u0011P a‡b−jP j if a<pb P a\fP b … X j—−1– a‡j\u0010—p−1–—b−j– a−pj \u0011\fP a‡b−jP j − X j—−1– a‡j\u0010 —p−1–—b−j–−1 a−pj−1 \u0011P a‡b−j\fP j if a \u0014 pb By convention, the binomial coefﬁcient \u0010 m n \u0011 is taken to be zero if m or n is negative or if m< n . Also \u0010m 0 \u0011 … 1 for m \u0015 0. For example, taking a … 1 in the Adem relation for the Steenrod squares we have Sq1Sqb … —b − 1–Sqb‡1 ,so Sq1Sq2i … Sq2i‡1 and Sq1Sq2i‡1 … 0 . The relations Sq1Sq2i … Sq2i‡1 and Sq1 … \f explain the earlier comment that Sq2i is the analog of P i for p … 2. The Steenrod algebra A2 is deﬁned to be the algebra over Z2 that is the quotient of the algebra of polynomials in the noncommuting variables Sq1;Sq2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 by the two- sided ideal generated by the Adem relations, that is, by the polynomials given by the differences between the left and right sides of the Adem relations. In similar fashion, Ap for odd p is deﬁned to be the algebra over Zp formed by polynomials in the noncommuting variables \f; P 1;P 2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 modulo the Adem relations and the relation Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 497 \f 2 … 0 . Thus for every space X , H\u0003—X; Zp– is a module over Ap , for all primes p . The Steenrod algebra is a graded algebra, the elements of degree k being those that map Hn—X; Zp– to Hn‡k—X; Zp– for all n . The next proposition implies that A2 is generated as an algebra by the elements Sq2k , while Ap for p odd is generated by \f and the elements P pk . Proposition 4L.8. There is a relation Sqi … P 0<j<i ajSqi−jSqj with coefﬁcients aj 2 Z2 whenever i is not a power of 2 . Similarly, if i is not a power of p there is a relation P i … P 0<j<i ajP i−jP j with aj 2 Zp . Proof: The argument is the same for p … 2 and p odd, so we describe the latter case. The idea is to write i as the sum a ‡ b of integers a> 0 and b> 0 with a<pb , such that the coefﬁcient of the j … 0 term in the Adem relation for P aP b is nonzero. Then one can solve this relation for P a‡b … P i . Let the p adic representation of i be i … i0 ‡ i1p ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ ikpk with ik ﬂ 0. Let b … pk and a … i − pk ,so b> 0 and a> 0if i is not a power of p . The claim is that \u0010—p−1–b−1 a \u0011 is nonzero in Zp . The p adic expansion of —p − 1–b − 1 … —pk‡1 − 1– − pk is —p − 1– ‡ —p − 1–p ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ —p − 2–pk , and the p adic expansion of a is i0 ‡ i1p ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ —ik − 1–pk . Hence \u0010 —p−1–b−1 a \u0011 \u0011 \u0010 p−1 i0 \u0011 \u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0010 p−2 ik−1 \u0011 and in each factor of the latter product the numerator is nonzero in Zp so the product is nonzero in Zp . When p … 2 the last factor is omitted, and the product is still nonzero in Z2 . tu This proposition says that most of the Sqi ’s and P i ’s are decomposable, where an element a of a graded algebra such as Ap is decomposable if it can be expressed in the form Pi aibi with each ai and bi having lower degree than a . The operation Sq2k is indecomposable since for \u000b a generator of H1—RP1; Z2– we saw that Sq2k —\u000b 2k – … \u000b2k‡1 but Sqi—\u000b 2k – … 0 for 0 <i< 2 k . Similarly P pk is indecomposable since if \u000b 2 H2—CP1; Zp– is a generator then P pk —\u000b pk – … \u000b pk‡1 but P i—\u000b pk – … 0 for 0 <i<pk and also \f—\u000b pk – … 0. Here is an application of the preceding proposition: Theorem 4L.9. Suppose H\u0003—X; Zp– is the polynomial algebra Zpƒ\u000b⁄ on a generator \u000b of dimension n , possibly truncated by the relation \u000bm … 0 for m> p . Then if p … 2 , n must be a power of 2 , and if p is an odd prime, n must be of the form pk` where ` is an even divisor of 2—p − 1– . As we mentioned in x3.2, there is a stronger theorem that n must be 1 , 2 , 4 , or 8 when p … 2 , and n must be an even divisor of 2—p − 1– when p is an odd prime. We also gave examples showing the necessity of the hypothesis m> p in the case of a truncated polynomial algebra. Proof: In the case p … 2, Sqn—\u000b– … \u000b 2 ﬂ 0. If n is not a power of 2 then Sqn decomposes into compositions Sqn−jSqj with 0 <j <n . Such compositions must be zero since they pass through the group Hn‡j—X; Z2– which is zero for 0 <j <n . 498 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory For odd p , the fact that \u000b2 is nonzero implies that n is even, say n … 2k . Then P k—\u000b– … \u000b p ﬂ 0 . Since P k can be expressed in terms of P pi ’s, some P pi must be nonzero in H\u0003—X; Zp– . This implies that 2pi—p − 1– , the amount by which P pi raises dimension, must be a multiple of n since H\u0003—X; Zp– is concentrated in dimensions that are multiples of n . Since n divides 2pi—p − 1– , it must be a power of p times a divisor of 2—p − 1– , and this divisor must be even since n is even and p is odd. tu Corollary 4L.10. If H\u0003—X; Z– is a polynomial algebra Zƒ\u000b⁄ , possibly truncated by \u000bm … 0 with m> 3 , then j\u000bj… 2 or 4 . Proof: Passing from Z to Z2 coefﬁcients, the theorem implies that j\u000bj is a power of 2 , and taking Z3 coefﬁcients we see that j\u000bj is a power of 3 times a divisor of 2—3 − 1– … 4. tu In particular, the octonionic projective plane OP2 , constructed in Example 4.47 by attaching a 16 cell to S 8 via the Hopf map S 15!S 8 , does not generalize to an octonionic projective n space OPn with n \u0015 3. In a similar vein, decomposability implies that if an element of ˇ s \u0003 is detected by a Sqi or P i then i must be a power of 2 for Sqi and a power of p for P i . For if Sqi is decomposable, then the map Sqi : Hn—Cf : Z2–!Hn‡i—Cf ; Z2– must be trivial since it is a sum of compositions that pass through trivial cohomology groups, and similarly for P i . Interestingly enough, the Adem relations can also be used in a positive way to detect elements of ˇ s \u0003 , as the proof of the following result will show. Proposition 4L.11. If \u0011 2 ˇ s 1 is represented by the Hopf map S 3!S 2 , then \u0011 2 is nonzero in ˇ s 2 . Similarly, the other two Hopf maps represent elements \u0017 2 ˇ s 3 and ˙ 2 ˇ s 7 whose squares are nontrivial in ˇ s 6 and ˇ s 14 . Proof: Let \u0011 : S n‡1!S n be a suspension of the Hopf map, with mapping cone C\u0011 obtained from S n by attaching a cell en‡2 via \u0011 . If we assume the composition —Ö\u0011–\u0011 is nullhomotopic, then we can deﬁne a map f : S n‡3!C\u0011 in the following way. Decompose S n‡3 as the union of two cones CS n‡2 . On one of these cones let f be a nullhomotopy of —Ö\u0011–\u0011 . On the other cone let f be the composition CS n‡2!CS n‡1!C\u0011 where the ﬁrst map is obtained by coning Ö\u0011 and the second map is a characteristic map for the cell en‡2 . S CS S ´ ´ Sn C e n 2+ n 2+ n 2+CS n 2+ CS n 1+ n 1+§´ Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 499 We use the map f to attach a cell en‡4 to C\u0011 , forming a space X . This has C\u0011 as its —n ‡ 2– skeleton, so Sq2 : Hn—X; Z2–!Hn‡2—X; Z2– is an isomorphism. The map Sq2 : Hn‡2—X; Z2–!Hn‡4—X; Z2– is also an isomorphism since the quotient map X!X=S n induces an isomorphism on cohomology groups above dimension n and X=S n is homotopy equivalent to the mapping cone of Ö 2\u0011 . Thus the composition Sq2Sq2 : Hn—X; Z2–!Hn‡4—X; Z2– is an isomorphism. But this is impossible in view of the Adem relation Sq2Sq2 … Sq3Sq1 , since Sq1 is trivial on Hn—X; Z2– . The same argument shows that \u0017 2 and ˙ 2 are nontrivial using the relations Sq4Sq4 … Sq7Sq1 ‡ Sq6Sq2 and Sq8Sq8 … Sq15Sq1 ‡ Sq14Sq2 ‡ Sq12Sq4 . tu This line of reasoning does not work for odd primes and the element \u000b 2 ˇ s 2p−3 detected by P 1 since the Adem relation for P 1P 1 is P 1P 1 … 2P 2 , which is not helpful. And in fact \u000b2 … 0 by the commutativity property of the product in ˇ s \u0003 . When dealing with A2 it is often convenient to abbreviate notation by writing a monomial Sqi1 Sqi2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 as SqI where I is the ﬁnite sequence of nonnegative integers i1;i2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 . Call SqI admissible if no Adem relation can be applied to it, that is, if ij \u0015 2ij‡1 for all j . The Adem relations imply that every monomial SqI can be written as a sum of admissible monomials. For if SqI is not admissible, it contains a pair SqaSqb to which an Adem relation can be applied, yielding a sum of terms SqJ for which J> I with respect to the lexicographic ordering on ﬁnite sequences of integers. These SqJ ’s have the same degree i1 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ ik as SqI , and since the number of monomials SqI of a ﬁxed degree is ﬁnite, successive applications of the Adem relations eventually reduce any SqI to a sum of admissible monomials. For odd p , elements of Ap are linear combinations of monomials \f \"1 P i1 \f\"2 P i2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 with each \"j … 0 or 1 . Such a monomial is admissible if ij \u0015 \"j‡1 ‡ pij‡1 for all j , which again means that no Adem relation can be applied to the monomial. As with A2 , the Adem relations sufﬁce to reduce every monomial to a linear combination of ad- missible monomials, by the same argument as before but now using the lexicographic ordering on tuples —\"1 ‡ pi1;\"2 ‡ pi2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . Deﬁne the excess of the admissible monomial SqI to be P j—ij − 2ij‡1– , the amount by which SqI exceeds being admissible. For odd p one might expect the ex- cess of an admissible monomial \f \"1 P i1 \f\"2 P i2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 to be deﬁned as P j—ij −pij‡1 −\"j‡1– , but instead it is deﬁned to be Pj—2ij − 2pij‡1 − \"j‡1– , for reasons which will become clear below. As we explained at the beginning of this section, cohomology operations corre- spond to elements in the cohomology of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces. Here is a rather important theorem which will be proved in [SSAT] since the proof makes heavy use of spectral sequences: 500 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Theorem. For each prime p , H\u0003—K—Zp;n–; Zp– is the free commutative algebra on the generators Ò—\u0013n– where \u0013n 2 Hn—K—Zp;n–; Zp– is a generator and Ò ranges over all admissible monomials of excess less than n . Here ‘free commutative algebra’ means ‘polynomial algebra’ when p … 2 and ‘polynomial algebra on even-dimensional generators tensor exterior algebra on odd- dimensional generators’ when p is odd. We will say something about the rationale behind the ‘excess less than n ’ condition in a moment. Specializing the theorem to the ﬁrst two cases n … 1; 2 , we have the following cohomology algebras: K—Z2; 1– : Z2ƒ\u0013⁄ K—Zp; 1– : ÓZp ƒ\u0013⁄⊗Zpƒ\f\u0013⁄ K—Z2; 2– : Z2ƒ\u0013; Sq1\u0013; Sq2Sq1\u0013; Sq4Sq2Sq1\u0013; \u0001\u0001\u0001⁄ K—Zp; 2– : Zpƒ\u0013; \fP 1\f\u0013; \fP pP 1\f\u0013; \fP p2 P pP 1\f\u0013; \u0001\u0001\u0001⁄ ⊗ ÓZp ƒ\f\u0013; P 1\f\u0013; P pP 1\f\u0013; P p2 P pP 1\f\u0013; \u0001\u0001\u0001⁄ The theorem implies that the admissible monomials in Ap are linearly indepen- dent, hence form a basis for Ap as a vector space over Zp . For if some linear com- bination of admissible monomials were zero, then it would be zero when applied to the class \u0013n , but if we choose n larger than the excess of each monomial in the lin- ear combination, this would contradict the freeness of the algebra H\u0003—K—Zp;n–; Zp– . Even though the multiplicative structure of the Steenrod algebra is rather complicated, the Adem relations provide a way of performing calculations algorithmically by sys- tematically reducing all products to sums of admissible monomials. A proof of the linear independence of admissible monomials using more elementary techniques can be found in [Steenrod & Epstein 1962]. Another consequence of the theorem is that all cohomology operations with Zp coefﬁcients are polynomials in the Sqi ’s when p … 2 and polynomials in the P i ’s and \f when p is odd, in view of Proposition 4L.1. We can also conclude that Ap con- sists precisely of all the Zp cohomology operations that are stable, commuting with suspension. For consider the map ÖK—Zp;n–!K—Zp;n ‡ 1– that pulls \u0013n‡1 back to the suspension of \u0013n . This map induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups ˇi for i \u0014 2n and a surjection for i … 2n ‡ 1 by Corollary 4.24, hence the same is true for homology and cohomology. Letting n go to inﬁnity, the limit lim -- eH\u0003—K—Zp;n–; Zp– then exists in a strong sense. On the one hand, this limit is exactly the stable opera- tions by Proposition 4K.1 and the deﬁnition of a stable operation. On the other hand, the preceding theorem implies that this limit is Ap since it says that all elements of H\u0003—K—Zp;n–; Zp– below dimension 2n are uniquely expressible as sums of admissible monomials applied to \u0013n . Now let us explain why the condition ‘excess less than n ’ in the theorem is natural. For a monomial SqI … Sqi1 Sqi2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 the deﬁnition of the excess e—I– can be rewritten as Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 501 an equation i1 … e—I– ‡ i2 ‡ i3 ‡ \u0001\u0001\u0001 . Thus if e—I–>n , we have i1 > jSqi2 Sqi3 \u0001\u0001\u0001 —\u0013n–j , hence SqI—\u0013n– … 0 . And if e—I– … n then SqI—\u0013n– … —Sqi2 Sqi3 \u0001\u0001\u0001 —\u0013n–– 2 and either Sqi2 Sqi3 \u0001\u0001\u0001 has excess less than n or it has excess equal to n and we can repeat the process to write Sqi2 Sqi3 \u0001\u0001\u0001 —\u0013n– … —Sqi3 \u0001\u0001\u0001 —\u0013n–– 2 , and so on, until we obtain an equation SqI—\u0013n– … ( SqJ —\u0013n–\u00012k with e—J–<n , so that SqI—\u0013n– is already in the algebra generated by the elements SqJ —\u0013n– with e—J–<n . The situation for odd p is similar. For an admissible monomial P I … \f \"1 P i1 \f\"2 P i2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 the deﬁnition of excess gives 2i1 … e—I– ‡ \"2 ‡ 2—p − 1–i2 ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ,so if e—I–>n we must have P I—\u0013n– … 0 , and if e—I– … n then either P I—\u0013n– is a power ( P J —\u0013n–\u0001pk with e—J–<n , or, if P I begins with \f , then P I—\u0013n– … \f ( —P J —\u0013n–– pk \u0001 … 0 by the formula \f—xm– … mxm−1\f—x– , which is valid when jxj is even, as we may assume is the case here, otherwise —P J —\u0013n–– pk … 0 by commutativity of cup product. There is another set of relations among Steenrod squares equivalent to the Adem relations and somewhat easier to remember: X j \u0010k j\u0011Sq2n−k−j−1Sqn‡j … 0 When k … 0 this is simply the relation Sq2n−1Sqn … 0 , and the cases k> 0 are obtained from this via Pascal’s triangle. For example, from Sq7Sq4 … 0 we obtain the following table of relations: Sq7Sq4 … 0 Sq6Sq4 ‡ Sq7Sq3 … 0 Sq5Sq4 ‡ Sq7Sq2 … 0 Sq4Sq4 ‡ Sq5Sq3 ‡ Sq6Sq2 ‡ Sq7Sq1 … 0 Sq3Sq4 ‡ Sq7Sq0 … 0 Sq2Sq4 ‡ Sq3Sq3 ‡ Sq6Sq0 … 0 Sq1Sq4 ‡ Sq3Sq2 ‡ Sq5Sq0 … 0 Sq0Sq4 ‡ Sq1Sq3 ‡ Sq2Sq2 ‡ Sq3Sq1 ‡ Sq4Sq0 … 0 These relations are not in simplest possible form. For example, Sq5Sq3 … 0 in the fourth row and Sq3Sq2 … 0 in the seventh row, instances of Sq2n−1Sqn … 0 . For Steenrod powers there are similar relations Pj \u0010 k j\u0011P pn−k−j−1P n‡j … 0 derived from the basic relation P pn−1P n … 0 . We leave it to the interested reader to show that these relations follow from the Adem relations. Constructing the Squares and Powers Now we turn to the construction of the Steenrod squares and powers, and the proof of their basic properties including the Adem relations. As will be seen, this all hinges on the fact that cohomology is maps into Eilenberg–MacLane spaces. The case p … 2 is in some ways simpler than the case p odd, so in the ﬁrst part of the development we will specialize p to 2 whenever there is a signiﬁcant difference between the two cases. 502 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Before giving the detailed construction, let us describe the idea in the simplest case p … 2 . The cup product square \u000b 2 of an element \u000b 2 Hn—X; Z2– can be viewed as a composition X!X \u0002 X!K—Z2; 2n– , with the ﬁrst map the diagonal map and the second map representing the cross product \u000b\u0002 \u000b . Since we have Z2 coefﬁcients, cup product and cross product are strictly commutative, so if T : X \u0002 X!X \u0002 X is the map transposing the two factors, T—x1;x2– … —x2;x1– , then T \u0003—\u000b\u0002 \u000b– … \u000b\u0002 \u000b . Thinking of \u000b\u0002 \u000b as a map X \u0002 X!K—Z2; 2n– , this says there is a homotopy ft from \u000b\u0002 \u000b to —\u000b\u0002 \u000b–T . If we follow the homotopy ft by the homotopy ftT , we obtain a homotopy from \u000b\u0002 \u000b to —\u000b\u0002 \u000b–T and then to —\u000b\u0002 \u000b–T 2 … \u000b\u0002 \u000b , that is, a loop of maps X \u0002 X!K—Z2; 2n– . We can view this loop as a map S 1 \u0002 X \u0002 X!K—Z2; 2n– . If the homotopy ft is chosen appropriately, the loop of maps will be nullhomotopic, extending to a map D2 \u0002 X \u0002 X!K—Z2; 2n– . Regarding D2 as the upper hemisphere of S 2 , this gives half of a map S 2 \u0002 X \u0002 X!K—Z2; 2n– , and once again we obtain the other half by composition with T . With a little care, the process can be repeated inﬁnitely often to yield a map S 1 \u0002 X \u0002 X!K—Z2; 2n– with the property that each pair of points —s; x1;x2– and —−s; x2;x1– is sent to the same point in K—Z2; 2n– . This means that when we compose with the evident map S 1 \u0002 X!S 1 \u0002 X \u0002 X , there is an induced quotient map RP1 \u0002 X!K—Z2; 2n– . This map represents a class in H2n—RP1 \u0002 X; Z2– . By the K¨unneth formula and the fact that H\u0003—RP1; Z2– is the polynomial ring Z2ƒ!⁄ , this cohomology class in H2n—RP1 \u0002 X; Z2– can be written in the form P i ! n−i \u0002 ai with ai 2 Hn‡i—X; Z2– . Then we deﬁne Sqi—\u000b– … ai . The construction of the map S 1 \u0002 X \u0002 X!K—Z2; 2n– will proceed cell by cell, so it will be convenient to eliminate any unnecessary cells. This is done by replacing X \u0002 X by the smash product X ^X and factoring out a cross-sectional slice S 1 in S 1 \u0002 X ^X . A further simpliﬁcation will be to use naturality to reduce to the case X … K—Z2;n– . Now we begin the actual construction. For a space X with basepoint x0 , let X^p denote the smash product X ^\u0001\u0001\u0001^X of p copies of X . There is a map T : X^p!X^p , T—x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xp– … —x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xp;x1– , permuting the factors cyclically. Note that when p … 2 this is just the transposition —x1;x2–,—x2;x1– . The map T generates an action of Zp on X^p . There is also the standard action of Zp on S 1 viewed as the union of the unit spheres S 2n−1 in Cn , a generator of Zp rotating each C factor through an angle 2ˇ=p , with quotient space an inﬁnite-dimensional lens space L 1 ,or RP1 when p … 2. On the product S 1 \u0002 X^p there is then the diagonal action g—s; x– … —g—s–; g—x–– for g 2 Zp . Let Ð X denote the orbit space —S 1 \u0002 X^p–=Zp of this diagonal action. This is the same as the Borel construction S 1 \u0002 Zp X^p described in x3.G. The projection S 1 \u0002 X^p!S 1 induces a projection ˇ : Ð X!L1 with ˇ −1—z– … X^p for all z 2 L 1 since the action of Zp on S 1 is free. This projection Ð X!L1 is in fact a ﬁber bundle, though we shall not need this fact and so we leave the proof as an exercise. The Zp action on X^p ﬁxes the basepoint x0 2 X^p , so the inclusion S 1 \u0002fx0g > S 1 \u0002 X^p induces an inclusion L 1 > Ð X . The composition L 1 > Ð X!L 1 is the identity, so in Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 503 ﬁber bundle terminology this subspace L 1 ˆ Ð X is a section of the bundle. Let ÓX denote the quotient Ð X=L 1 obtained by collapsing the section L 1 to a point. Note that the ﬁbers X^p in Ð X are still embedded in the quotient ÓX since each ﬁber meets the section L1 in a single point. If we replace S 1 by S 1 in these deﬁnition, we get subspaces Ð 1X ˆ Ð X and Ó1X ˆ ÓX . All these spaces have natural CW structures if X is a CW complex having x0 as a 0 cell. Namely, L 1 is given its standard CW structure with one cell in each dimension. This is lifted to a CW structure on S 1 with p cells in each dimension, and then T freely permutes the product cells of S 1 \u0002 X^p so there is induced a quotient CW structure on Ð X . The section L1 ˆ Ð X is a subcomplex, so the quotient ÓX inherits a CW structure from Ð X . For example, if the n skeleton of X is S n with its usual CW structure, then the pn skeleton of ÓX is S pn with its usual CW structure. We remark also that Ð , Ð 1 , Ó , and Ó 1 are functors: A map f : —X; x0–!—Y ; y0– induces maps Ð f : Ð X!Ð Y , etc., in the evident way. For brevity we write H\u0003—−; Zp– simply as H\u0003—−– . For n> 0 let Kn denote a CW complex K—Zp;n– with —n−1– skeleton a point and n skeleton S n . Let \u0013 2 Hn—Kn– be the canonical fundamental class described in the discussion following Theorem 4.57. It will be notationally convenient to regard an element \u000b 2 Hn—X– also as a map \u000b : X!Kn such that \u000b \u0003—\u0013– … \u000b . Here we are assuming X is a CW complex. From x3.2 we have a reduced p fold cross product eH\u0003—X– ⊗p! eH\u0003—X^p– where eH\u0003—X– ⊗p denotes the p fold tensor product of eH\u0003—X– with itself. This cross prod- uct map eH\u0003—X– ⊗p! eH\u0003—X^p– is an isomorphism since we are using Zp coefﬁcients. With this isomorphism in mind, we will use the notation \u000b1 ⊗ \u0001\u0001\u0001 ⊗ \u000bp rather than \u000b1 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 \u000bp for p fold cross products in eH\u0003—X^p– . In particular, for each element \u000b 2 Hn—X– , n> 0 , we have its p fold cross product \u000b ⊗p 2 eH\u0003—X^p– . Our ﬁrst task will be to construct an element \u0015—\u000b– 2 Hpn—ÓX– restricting to \u000b ⊗p in each ﬁber X^p ˆ ÓX . By naturality it will sufﬁce to construct \u0015—\u0013– 2 Hpn—ÓKn– . The key point in the construction of \u0015—\u0013– is the fact that T \u0003—\u0013 ⊗p– … \u0013 ⊗p . In terms of maps K^p n !Kpn , this says the composition \u0013 ⊗p T is homotopic to \u0013 ⊗p , preserving basepoints. Such a homotopy can be constructed as follows. The pn skeleton of K^p n is —S n– ^p … S pn , with T permuting the factors cyclically. Thinking of Sn as —S 1–^n , the permutation T is a product of —p − 1–n transpositions of adjacent factors, so T has degree —−1–—p−1–n on S pn .If p is odd, this degree is ‡1 , so the restriction of T to this skeleton is homotopic to the identity, hence \u0013 ⊗p T is homotopic to \u0013 ⊗p on this skeleton. This conclusion also holds when p … 2 , signs being irrelevant in this case since we are dealing with maps S 2n!K2n and ˇ2n—K2n– … Z2 . Having a homotopy \u0013⊗p T ' \u0013 ⊗p on the pn skeleton, there are no obstructions to extending the homotopy over all higher-dimensional cells ei \u0002 —0; 1– since ˇi—Kpn– … 0 for i>pn . The homotopy \u0013 ⊗p T ' \u0013⊗p : K^p n !Kpn deﬁnes a map Ð 1Kn!Kpn since Ð 1X is the quotient of I \u0002 X^p under the identiﬁcations —0;x– ˘ —1; T —x–– . The homo- 504 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory topy is basepoint-preserving, so the map Ð 1Kn!Kpn passes down to a quotient map \u00151 : Ó 1Kn!Kpn . Since Kn is obtained from S n by attaching cells of dimension greater than n , ÓKn is obtained from Ó 1Kn by attaching cells of dimension greater than pn ‡ 1 . There are then no obstructions to extending \u00151 to a map \u0015 : ÓKn!Kpn since ˇi—Kpn– … 0 for i>pn . The map \u0015 gives the desired element \u0015—\u0013– 2 Hpn—ÓKn– since the restriction of \u0015 to each ﬁber K^p n is homotopic to \u0013 ⊗p . Note that this property determines \u0015 uniquely up to homotopy since the restriction map Hpn—ÓKn–!Hpn—K^p n – is injective, the pn skeleton of ÓKn being contained in K^p n . We shall have occasion to use this argument again in the proof, so we refer to it as ‘the uniqueness argument.’ For any \u000b 2 Hn—X– let \u0015—\u000b– be the composition ÓX Ó\u000b-----! ÓKn \u0015-----! Kpn . This restricts to \u000b⊗p in each ﬁber X^p since Ó\u000b restricts to \u000b⊗p in each ﬁber. Now we are ready to deﬁne some cohomology operations. There is an inclu- sion L1 \u0002 X > Ð X as the quotient of the diagonal embedding S 1 \u0002 X > S 1 \u0002 X^p , —s; x– , —s; x; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x– . Composing with the quotient map Ð X!ÓX , we get a map r : L1 \u0002 X!ÓX inducing r \u0003 : H\u0003—ÓX–!H\u0003—L 1 \u0002 X– ˇ H\u0003—L 1– ⊗ H\u0003—X– . For each \u000b 2 Hn—X– the element r\u0003—\u0015—\u000b–– 2 Hpn—L1 \u0002 X– may be written in the form r\u0003—\u0015—\u000b–– … X i !—p−1–n−i ⊗ \u0012i—\u000b– where !j is a generator of Hj—L 1– and \u0012i—\u000b– 2 Hn‡i—X– . Thus \u0012i increases dimen- sion by i . When p … 2 there is no ambiguity about !j . For odd p we choose !1 to be the class dual to the 1 cell of L 1 in its standard cell structure, then we take !2 to be the Bockstein \f!1 and we set !2j … ! j 2 and !2j‡1 … !1! j 2 . It is clear that \u0012i is a cohomology operation since \u0012i—\u000b– … \u000b \u0003—\u0012i—\u0013–– . For p … 2 we set Sqi—\u000b– … \u0012i—\u000b– . For odd p we will show that \u0012i … 0 unless i … 2k—p − 1– or 2k—p − 1– ‡ 1 . The operation P k will be deﬁned to be a certain constant times \u00122k—p−1– , and \u00122k—p−1–‡1 will be a constant times \fP k , for \f the mod p Bockstein. Theorem 4L.12. The operations Sqi satisfy the properties (1)–(7). Proof: We have already observed that the \u0012i ’s are cohomology operations, so property (1) holds. Because cohomology operations cannot decrease dimension, we have \u0012i … 0 for i< 0 . Also, \u0012i … 0 for i>—p − 1–n since the factor !—p−1–n−i vanishes in this case. The basic property that \u0015—\u000b– restricts to \u000b ⊗p in each ﬁber implies that \u0012—p−1–n—\u000b– … \u000b p since !0 … 1 . This gives property (5). To show the additivity property (2) we will show \u0015—\u000b ‡ \f– … \u0015—\u000b– ‡ \u0015—\f– using the following diagram: ƒ ƒ £ £ ¸ ¸ ¤ ¶¶11 X nn ¤ () ¤ () ¤ XX() £¤ KK() n¤ K £ n¤ X ¤X £¤ K n¤K pnK ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ® ¯ ¤() £¤¤® ¯ \u0000\u0000+ ¶¶11()\u0000\u0000+ ¸¸11\u0000\u0000+ Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 505 Here Ñ is a generic symbol for diagonal maps x , —x; x– . These relate cross product to cup product via Ñ\u0003—' ⊗ – … ' ` . The two unlabeled vertical maps are induced by —s; x1;y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xp;yp–,—s; x1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xp;s;y1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;yp– . It is obvious that the central square in the diagram commutes, and also the left and upper right triangles. To show that the remaining triangle commutes it sufﬁces to show this when we restrict to the ﬁber —Kn \u0002 Kn–^p by the uniqueness argument used earlier, since —Kn \u0002 Kn– ^p contains the pn skeleton of Ó—Kn \u0002 Kn– . On the ﬁber the two routes to Kpn are \u0013⊗p ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u0013 ⊗p and —\u0013 ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u0013– ⊗p . These are equal since raising to the p th power is an additive homomorphism of the ﬁeld Zp . The composition ÓX!ÓKn is Ó—\u000b ‡ \f– , so the composition ÓX!Kpn across the top of the diagram is \u0015—\u000b ‡ \f– . Going from ÓX to Kpn across the bottom of the diagram gives \u0015—\u000b– ‡ \u0015—\f– since the second and third steps of this composition give \u0015—\u000b– ⊗ 1 ‡ 1 ⊗ \u0015—\f– and Ñ \u0003—' ⊗ – … ' ` . Thus \u0015—\u000b ‡ \f– … \u0015—\u000b– ‡ \u0015—\f– , which implies that each \u0012i is an additive homomorphism. Next we turn to the Cartan formula. For any prime p we will show that \u0015—\u000b`\f– … —−1–p—p−1–mn=2\u0015—\u000b–\u0015—\f– for m …j\u000bj and n …j\fj .

The composition ÓX ^ ÓX!Kpm‡pn is \u0015—\u000b– ⊗ \u0015—\f– so the composition ÓX!Kpm‡pn across the bottom of the diagram is \u0015—\u000b– ` \u0015—\f– . Commutativity of the square and the upper two triangles is obvious from the deﬁnitions. It remains to see that the lower triangle commutes up to the sign —−1–p—p−1–mn=2 . Since —Km ^ Kn– ^p includes the —pm ‡ pn– skeleton of Ó—Km ^ Kn– , restriction to this ﬁber is injective on Hpm‡pn . On this ﬁber the two routes around the triangle give —\u0013m ⊗ \u0013n– ⊗p and \u0013 ⊗p m ⊗ \u0013⊗p n . These differ by a permutation that is the product of —p − 1– ‡ —p − 2– ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ 1 … p—p − 1–=2 transpositions of adjacent fac- tors. Since \u0013m and \u0013n have dimensions m and n , this permutation introduces a 506 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory sign —−1– p—p−1–mn=2 by the commutativity property of cup product. This ﬁnishes the veriﬁcation of the Cartan formula when p … 2. Before proceeding further we need to make an explicit calculation to show that Sq0 is the identity on H1—S 1– . Viewing S 1 as the one-point compactiﬁcation of R , with the point at inﬁnity as the basepoint, the 2 sphere S 1 ^S 1 becomes the one-point compactiﬁcation of R2 . The map T : S 1 ^ S 1!S 1 ^ S 1 then corresponds to reﬂecting R2 across the line x … y , so after a rotation of coordinates this becomes reﬂection of S 2 across the equator. Hence Ð 1S 1 is obtained from the shell I \u0002 S 2 by identifying its inner and outer boundary spheres via a reﬂection across the equator. The diagonal RP1 \u0002 S 1 ˆ Ð 1S 1 is a torus, obtained from the equato- rial annulus I \u0002 S 1 ˆ I \u0002 S 2 by identifying the two ends via the identity map since the equator is ﬁxed by the reﬂection. This RP1 \u0002 S 1 represents the same element of H2—Ð 1S 1; Z2– as the ﬁber sphere S 1 ^ S 1 since the upper half of the shell is a 3 cell whose mod 2 boundary in Ð 1S 1 is the union of these two surfaces. For a generator \u000b 2 H1—S 1– , consider the element r \u0003—\u0015—\u000b–– in H2—RP1 \u0002 S 1– ˇ Hom—H2—RP1 \u0002 S 1; Z2–; Z2– . A basis for H2—RP1 \u0002 S 1; Z2– is represented by RP2 \u0002fx0g and RP1 \u0002 S 1 . A cocycle representing r \u0003—\u0015—\u000b–– takes the value 0 on RP2 \u0002fx0g since RP1 \u0002fx0g collapses to a point in ÓS 1 and \u0015—\u000b– lies in H2—ÓS 1– .On RP1 \u0002 S 1 , r\u0003—\u0015—\u000b–– takes the value 1 since when \u0015—\u000b– is pulled back to Ð S 1 it takes the same value on the homologous cycles RP1 \u0002 S 1 and S 1 ^ S 1 , namely 1 by the deﬁning prop- erty of \u0015—\u000b– since \u000b ⊗ \u000b 2 H2—S 1 ^ S 1– is a generator. Thus r \u0003—\u0015—\u000b–– … !1 ⊗ \u000b and hence Sq0—\u000b– … \u000b by the deﬁnition of Sq0 . We use this calculation to prove that Sqi commutes with the suspension ˙ , where ˙ is deﬁned by ˙ —\u000b– … \" ⊗ \u000b 2 H\u0003—S 1 ^ X– for \" a generator of H1—S 1– and \u000b 2 H \u0003—X– . We have just seen that Sq0—\"– … \" . By (5), Sq1—\"– … \"2 … 0 and Sqi—\"– … 0 for i> 1 . The Cartan formula then gives Sqi—˙ —\u000b–– … Sqi—\" ⊗ \u000b– … Pj Sqj—\"– ⊗ Sqi−j—\u000b– … \" ⊗ Sqi—\u000b– … ˙—Sqi—\u000b–– . From this it follows that Sq0 is the identity on Hn—S n– for all n> 0 . Since S n is the n skeleton of Kn , this implies that Sq0 is the identity on the fundamental class \u0013n , hence Sq0 is the identity on all positive-dimensional classes. Property (7) is proved similarly: Sq1 coincides with the Bockstein \f on the gener- ator ! 2 H1—RP2– since both equal ! 2 . Hence Sq1 … \f on the iterated suspensions of ! , and the n fold suspension of RP2 is the —n ‡ 2– skeleton of Kn‡1 . tu Theorem 4L.13. The Adem relations hold for Steenrod squares. Proof: The idea is to imitate the construction of ÓX using Zp \u0002 Zp in place of Zp . The Adem relations will then arise from the symmetry of Zp \u0002 Zp interchanging the two factors. Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 507 The group Zp \u0002 Zp acts on S 1 \u0002 S 1 via —g; h–—s; t– … —g—s–; h—t–– , with quotient L1 \u0002 L1 . There is also an action of Zp \u0002 Zp on X^p2 , obtained by writing points of X^p2 as p2 tuples —xij– with subscripts i and j varying from 1 to p , and then letting the ﬁrst Zp act on the ﬁrst subscript and the second Zp act on the second. Factoring out the diagonal action of Zp \u0002 Zp on S 1 \u0002 S 1 \u0002 X^p2 gives a quotient space Ð2X . This projects to L1 \u0002 L 1 with a section, and collapsing the section gives Ó2X . The ﬁbers of the projection Ó2X!L1 \u0002 L1 are X^p2 since the action of Zp \u0002 Zp on S 1 \u0002 S 1 is free. We could also obtain Ó2X from the product S 1 \u0002 S 1 \u0002 Xp2 by ﬁrst collapsing the subspace of points having at least one X coordinate equal to the basepoint x0 and then factoring out the Zp \u0002 Zp action. It will be useful to compare Ó2X with Ó—ÓX– . The latter space is the quotient of S 1 \u0002 —S 1 \u0002 Xp– p in which one ﬁrst identiﬁes all points having at least one X coordi- nate equal to x0 and then one factors out by an action of the wreath product Zp o Zp , the group of order pp‡1 deﬁned by a split exact sequence 0!Zp p!Zp o Zp!Zp!0 with conjugation by the quotient group Zp given by cyclic permutations of the p Zp factors of Z p p . In the coordinates —s; t1;x11; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x1p; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;tp;xp1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xpp– the i th factor Zp of Z p p acts in the block —ti;xi1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xip– , and the quotient Zp acts by cyclic permutation of the index i and by rotation in the s coordinate. There is a natural map Ó2X!Ó—ÓX– induced by —s;t;x11; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x1p; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xp1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xpp– , —s;t;x11; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x1p; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;t;xp1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;xpp– .In Ó2X one is factoring out by the action of Zp \u0002 Zp . This is the subgroup of Zp o Zp obtained by restricting the action of the quo- tient Zp on Z p p to the diagonal subgroup Zp ˆ Zp p , where this action becomes trivial so that one has the direct product Zp \u0002 Zp . Since it sufﬁces to prove that the Adem relations hold on the class \u0013 2 Hn—Kn– , we take X … Kn . There is a map \u00152 : Ó2Kn!Kp2n restricting to \u0013 ⊗p2 in each ﬁber. This is constructed by the same method used to construct \u0015 . One starts with a map representing \u0013⊗p2 in a ﬁber, then extends this over the part of Ó2Kn projecting to the 1 skeleton of L 1 \u0002 L1 , and ﬁnally one extends inductively over higher-dimensional cells of Ó2Kn using the fact that Kp2n is an Eilenberg–MacLane space. The map \u00152 ﬁts into the diagram at the right, where r2 is in- duced by the map —s;t;x–, —s;t;x; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x– and the unlabeled map is the one deﬁned £ £ 2 2 2 2n£ L ¤nKK pnK () £ n¤Kn¤ K ¤ () ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! 1 L 1 L 1 5 5 5 11 ¸ ¸¸ above. It is clear that the square commutes. Commutativity of the triangle up to homotopy follows from the fact that \u00152 is uniquely determined, up to homotopy, by its restrictions to ﬁbers. The element r\u0003 2 \u0015 \u0003 2 —\u0013– may be written in the form P r;s !r ⊗ !s ⊗ 'rs , and we claim that the elements 'rs satisfy the symmetry rela- tion 'rs … —−1– rs‡p—p−1–n=2'sr . To verify this we use the commutative diagram at the right where the map ˝ £ 2 2 n£ ¤nKK¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!L 1 L 1 5 £ 2 2 n£ ¤nKK¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!L 1 L 1 5 ¿¿ on the left switches the two L 1 factors and the ˝ on 508 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory the right is induced by switching the two S 1 factors of S 1 \u0002 S 1 \u0002 K^p2 n and permuting the Kn factors of the smash product by interchanging the two subscripts in p2 tuples —xij– . This permutation is a product of p—p − 1–=2 transpositions, one for each pair —i; j– with 1 \u0014 i<j \u0014 p , so in a ﬁber the class \u0013 ⊗p2 is sent to —−1– p—p−1–n=2\u0013 ⊗p2 . By the uniqueness property of \u00152 this means that ˝ \u0003\u0015 \u0003 2 —\u0013– … —−1– p—p−1–n=2\u0015 \u0003 2 —\u0013– . Commutativity of the square then gives —−1–p—p−1–n=2r \u0003 2 \u0015 \u0003 2 —\u0013– …r \u0003 2 ˝ \u0003\u0015 \u0003 2 —\u0013– … ˝ \u0003r \u0003 2 \u0015 \u0003 2 —\u0013– … X r;s—−1– rs!s ⊗ !r ⊗ 'rs where the last equality follows from the commutativity property of cross products. The symmetry relation 'rs … —−1– rs‡p—p−1–n=2'sr follows by interchanging the in- dices r and s in the last summation. If we compute r\u0003 2 \u0015\u0003 2 —\u0013– using the lower route across the earlier diagram contain- ing the map \u00152 , we obtain r \u0003 2 \u0015 \u0003 2 —\u0013– … X i !—p−1–pn−i ⊗ \u0012i\u0010X j !—p−1–n−j ⊗ \u0012j—\u0013– \u0011 … X i;j !—p−1–pn−i ⊗ \u0012i( !—p−1–n−j ⊗ \u0012j—\u0013– \u0001 Now we specialize to p … 2, so \u0012i … Sqi for all i . The Cartan formula converts the last summation above into Pi;j;k ! 2n−i ⊗ Sqk—!n−j– ⊗ Sqi−kSqj—\u0013– . Plugging in the value for Sqk—! n−j– computed in the discussion preceding Example 4L.3, we obtain Pi;j;k \u0010 n−j k \u0011! 2n−i ⊗ ! n−j‡k ⊗ Sqi−kSqj—\u0013– . To write this summation more symmetri- cally with respect to the two ! terms, let n − j ‡ k … 2n − ` . Then we get X i;j;` \u0010 n−j n‡j−`\u0011! 2n−i ⊗ ! 2n−` ⊗ Sqi‡`−n−jSqj—\u0013– In view of the symmetry property of 'rs , which becomes 'rs … 'sr for p … 2, switching i and ` in this formula leaves it unchanged. Hence we get the relation —\u0003– X j \u0010 n−j n‡j−`\u0011Sqi‡`−n−jSqj—\u0013– … X j \u0010 n−j n‡j−i \u0011Sqi‡`−n−jSqj—\u0013– This holds for all n , i , and ` , and the idea is to choose these numbers so that the left side of this equation has only one nonzero term. Given integers r and s , let n … 2r − 1 ‡ s and ` … n ‡ s , so that \u0010 n−j n‡j−`\u0011 … \u0010 2r −1−—j−s– j−s \u0011 .If r is sufﬁciently large, this will be 0 unless j … s . This is because the dyadic expansion of 2r − 1 consists entirely of 1 ’s, so the expansion of 2 r − 1 − —j − s– will have 0 ’s in the positions where the expansion of j − s has 1 ’s, hence these positions contribute factors of \u00100 1\u0011 … 0to \u00102r −1−—j−s– j−s \u0011 . Thus with n and ` chosen as above, the relation —\u0003– becomes SqiSqs—\u0013– … X j \u0010 2r −1‡s−j 2r −1‡s‡j−i \u0011Sqi‡s−jSqj—\u0013– … X j \u0010 2r ‡s−j−1 i−2j \u0011Sqi‡s−jSqj—\u0013– where the latter equality comes from the general relation \u0010x y\u0011 … \u0010 x x−y\u0011 . The ﬁnal step is to show that \u00102r ‡s−j−1 i−2j \u0011 … \u0010 s−j−1 i−2j \u0011 if i< 2s . Both of these binomial coefﬁcients are zero if i< 2j .If i \u0015 2j then we have 2j \u0014 i< 2s ,so j< s , Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 509 hence s − j − 1 \u0015 0 . The term 2 r then makes no difference in \u0010 2r ‡s−j−1 i−2j \u0011 if r is large since this 2r contributes only a single 1 to the dyadic expansion of 2 r ‡ s − j − 1 , far to the left of all the nonzero entries in the dyadic expansions of s − j − 1 and i − 2j . This gives the Adem relations for the classes \u0013 of dimension n … 2r − 1 ‡ s with r large. This implies the relations hold for all classes of these dimensions, by naturality. Since we can suspend repeatedly to make any class have dimension of this form, the Adem relations must hold for all cohomology classes. tu Steenrod Powers Our remaining task is to verify the axioms and Adem relations for the Steenrod powers for an odd prime p . Unfortunately this is quite a bit more complicated than the p … 2 case, largely because one has to be very careful in computing the many coefﬁcients in Zp that arise. Even for the innocent-looking axiom P 0 … 11 it will take three pages to calculate the normalization constants needed to make the axiom hold. One could wish that the whole process was a lot cleaner. Lemma 4L.14. \u0012i … 0 unless i … 2k—p − 1– or 2k—p − 1– ‡ 1 . Proof: The group of automorphisms of Zp is the multiplicative group Z \u0003 p of nonzero elements of Zp . Since p is prime, Zp is a ﬁeld and Z\u0003 p is cyclic of order p −1 . Let r be a generator of Z\u0003 p . Deﬁne a map ' : S 1 \u0002 X^p!S 1 \u0002 X^p by '—s; —xi–– … —sr ;—xri–– where subscripts are taken mod p and sr means raise each coordinate of s , regarded as a unit vector in C1 , to the r th power and renormalize the resulting vector to have unit length. Then if γ is a generator of the Zp action on S 1 \u0002 X^p , we have '—γ—s; —xi––– … '—e2ˇ=ps; —xi‡1–– … —e2rˇ =psr ;—xri‡r –– … γr —'—s; —xi––– . This says that ' takes orbits to orbits, so ' induces maps ' : Ð X!Ð X and ' : ÓX!ÓX . Re- stricting to the ﬁrst coordinate, there is also an induced map ' : L 1!L 1 . Taking X … Kn , these maps ﬁt into the diagram at the right. The square obviously commutes, and the £ £ n L ¤nKK pnK £ n¤ KnK ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! 1 L 1 5 5 11 ¸ ¸ '' triangle commutes up to homotopy since it suf- ﬁces to verify this in the ﬁber X^p , and here the map ' is an even permutation of the coordinates since it has even order p − 1, so ' preserves \u0013 ⊗p . Commutativity of the diagram means that P i !—p−1–n−i ⊗ \u0012i—\u0013– is invariant under '\u0003 ⊗ 11 . The map ' induces multiplication by r in ˇ1—L 1– , hence also in H1—L1– and H1—L 1; Zp– , sending !1 to r!1 . Since !2 was chosen to be the Bockstein of !1 ,it is also multiplied by r . We chose r to have order p − 1in Z\u0003 p ,so '\u0003—!`– … !` only when the total number of !1 and !2 factors in !` is a multiple of p−1 , that is, when ` has the form 2k—p − 1– or 2k—p − 1– − 1 . Thus in the formula Pi !—p−1–n−i ⊗ \u0012i—\u0013– we must have \u0012i—\u0013– … 0 unless i is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 2—p − 1– . tu 510 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory Since \u00120 : Hn—X–!Hn—X– is a cohomology operation that preserves dimension, it must be deﬁned by a coefﬁcient homomorphism Zp!Zp , multiplication by some an 2 Zp . We claim that these an ’s satisfy am‡n … —−1– p—p−1–mn=2aman and an … —−1– p—p−1–n—n−1–=4an 1 To see this, recall the formula \u0015—\u000b ` \f– … —−1–p—p−1–mn=2\u0015—\u000b–\u0015—\f– for j\u000bj… m and j\fj… n . From the deﬁnition of the \u0012i ’s it then follows that \u00120—\u000b ` \f– … —−1–p—p−1–mn=2\u00120—\u000b–\u00120—\f– , which gives the ﬁrst part of the claim. The second part follows from this by induction on n . Lemma 4L.15. a1 …\u0006m! for m … —p − 1–=2 ,so p … 2m ‡ 1 . Proof: It sufﬁces to compute \u00120—\u000b– where \u000b is any nonzero 1 dimensional class, so the simplest thing is to choose \u000b to be a generator of H1—S 1– , say a generator coming from a generator of H1—S 1; Z– . This determines \u000b up to a sign. Since Hi—S 1– … 0 for i> 1 , we have \u0012i—\u000b– … 0 for i> 0 , so the deﬁning formula for \u00120—\u000b– has the form r\u0003—\u0015—\u000b–– … !p−1 ⊗ \u00120—\u000b– … a1!p−1 ⊗ \u000b in Hp—L 1 \u0002 S 1– . To compute a1 there is no harm in replacing L1 by a ﬁnite-dimensional lens space, say L p , the p skeleton of L 1 . Thus we may restrict the bundle ÓS 1!L1 to a bundle ÓpS 1!Lp with the same ﬁbers —S 1–^p … S p . We regard S 1 as the one-point compactiﬁcation of R with basepoint the added point at inﬁnity, and then —S 1–^p becomes the one-point compactiﬁcation of R p with Zp acting by permuting the coordinates of R p cyclically, preserving the origin and the point at inﬁnity. This action deﬁnes the bundle Ð pS 1!Lp with ﬁbers S p , containing a zero section and a section at inﬁnity, and Ó pS 1 is obtained by collapsing the section at inﬁnity. We can also describe ÓpS 1 as the one-point compactiﬁcation of the complement of the section at inﬁnity in Ð pS 1 , since the base space L p is compact. The complement of the section at inﬁnity is a bundle E!L p with ﬁbers R p . In general, the one-point compactiﬁcation of a ﬁber bundle E over a compact base space with ﬁbers Rn is called the Thom space T—E– of the bundle, and a class in Hn—T —E–– that restricts to a generator of Hn of the one-point compactiﬁcation of each ﬁber R n is called a Thom class. In our situation, \u0015—\u000b– is such a Thom class. Our ﬁrst task is to construct subbundles E0;E1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;Em of E , where E0 has ﬁber R and the other Ej ’s have ﬁber R 2 ,so p … 2m ‡ 1 . The bundle E comes from the linear transformation T : R p!R p permuting the coordinates cyclically. We claim there is a decomposition R p … V0 \b V1 \b \u0001\u0001\u0001 \b Vm with V0 1 dimensional and the other Vj ’s 2 dimensional, such that T—Vj– … Vj for all j , with T jj V0 the identity and T jj Vj a rotation by the angle 2ˇj=p for j> 0 . Thus T deﬁnes an action of Zp on Vj and we can deﬁne Ej just as E was deﬁned, as the quotient —S p \u0002 Vj–=Zp with respect to the diagonal action. An easy way to get the decomposition Rp … V0 \b V1 \b \u0001\u0001\u0001 \b Vm is to regard Rp as a module over the principal ideal domain Rƒt⁄ by setting tv … T—v– for Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 511 v 2 Rp . Then R p is isomorphic as a module to the module Rƒt⁄=—tp − 1– since T permutes coordinates cyclically; this amounts to identifying the standard basis vectors v1; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;vp in Rp with 1;t; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;tp−1 . The polynomial tp − 1 factors over C into the linear factors t − e2ˇij=p for j … 0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;p − 1 . Combining complex conjugate factors, this gives a factorization over R , tp − 1 … —t − 1–Q 1\u0014j\u0014m —t2 − 2—cos 'j–t ‡ 1– , where 'j … 2ˇj=p . These are distinct monic irreducible factors, so the module Rƒt⁄=—tp − 1– splits as Rƒt⁄=—t − 1–L1\u0014j\u0014mRƒt⁄=—t2 − 2—cos 'j–t ‡ 1– by the basic structure theory of modules over a principal ideal domain. This translates into a decomposition Rp … V0 \b V1 \b \u0001\u0001\u0001 \b Vm with T—Vj– ˆ Vj . Here V0 corresponds to Rƒt⁄=—t − 1– ˇ R with t acting as the identity, and Vj for j> 0 corresponds to Rƒt⁄=—t2 − 2—cos 'j–t ‡ 1– . The latter module is isomorphic to R 2 with t acting as rotation by the angle 'j since the characteristic polynomial of this rotation is readily computed to be t2 −2—cos 'j–t ‡1 , hence this rotation satisﬁes t2 −2—cos 'j–t ‡1 … 0 so there is a module homomorphism Rƒt⁄=—t2 − 2—cos 'j–t ‡ 1–!R 2 which is obvi- ously an isomorphism. From the decomposition Rp … V0 \b V1 \b \u0001\u0001\u0001 \b Vm and the action of T on each factor we can see that the only vectors ﬁxed by T are those in the line V0 . The vectors —x; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ;x– are ﬁxed by T ,so V0 must be this diagonal line. Next we compute Thom classes for the bundles Ej . This is easy for E0 which is the product Lp \u0002 R , so the projection E0!R one-point compactiﬁes to a map T—E0–!S 1 and we can pull back the chosen generator \u000b 2 H1—S 1– to a Thom class for E0 . The other Ej ’s have 2 dimensional ﬁbers, which we now view as C rather than R 2 . Just as Ej is the quotient of S p \u0002 C via the identiﬁcations —v; z– ˘ —e2ˇ i=pv; e2ˇij=pz– ,we can deﬁne a bundle Ej!CPm with ﬁber C by the identiﬁcations —v; z– ˘ —\u0015v; \u0015 jz– for \u0015 2 S 1 ˆ C . We then have the left half of the commu- tative diagram shown at the right, where the quotient map Ej L p CP m CP m Ej ¡¡¡¡¡! E ¡¡¡¡¡! ¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡! 1¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡! q q » f f » eq restricts to a homeomorphism on each ﬁber. The maps ef and f are induced by the map S p \u0002 C!S p \u0002 C sending —v; z– to —v j;z– where v j means raise each coordinate of v to the j th power and then rescale to get a vector of unit length. The map ef is well-deﬁned since equivalent pairs —v; z– ˘ —\u0015v; \u0015jz– in Ej are carried to pairs —v j;z– and —\u0015 jv j;\u0015 jz– that are equivalent in E1 . Since both eq and ef restrict to homeomorphisms in each ﬁber, they extend to maps of Thom spaces that pull a Thom class for E1 back to Thom classes for Ej and Ej . To construct a Thom class for E1 , observe that the Thom space T—E1– is homeomorphic to CPm‡1 , namely, view the sphere S p … S 2m‡1 as the unit sphere in Cm‡1 , and then the inclusion S p \u0002 C>Cm‡1 \u0002 C … C m‡2 induces a map g : E1!CPm‡1 since the equivalence relation deﬁning E1 is —v; z– ˘ —\u0015v; \u0015z– for \u0015 2 S 1 .It is evident that g is a homeomorphism onto the complement of the point ƒ0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 0; 1⁄ in CPm‡1 , so sending the point at inﬁnity in T—E1– to ƒ0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 0; 1⁄ gives an extension 512 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory of g to a homeomorphism T—E1– ˇ CPm‡1 . Under this homeomorphism the one-point compactiﬁcations of the ﬁbers of E1 correspond to the 2 spheres S 2 v consisting of ƒ0; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; 0; 1⁄ and the points ƒv; z⁄ 2 CPm‡1 with ﬁxed v 2 S p and varying z 2 C . Each S 2 v is a CP1 in CPm‡1 equivalent to the standard CP1 under a homeomorphism of CPm‡1 coming from a linear isomorphism of C m‡2 , so a generator γ of H2—CPm‡1– is a Thom class, restricting to a generator of H2—S 2 v – for each v . We choose γ to be the Zp reduction of a generator of H2—CPm‡1; Z– ,so γ is determined up to a sign. A slightly different view of Thom classes will be useful. For the bundle E!L p , for example, we have isomorphisms eH\u0003—T —E–– ˇ H\u0003—T —E–; 1– where 1 is the compactiﬁcation point ˇ H\u0003—T —E–; T —E– − L p– where L p is embedded in T—E– as the zero section, so T—E– − Lp deformation retracts onto 1 ˇ H\u0003—E; E − L p– by excision Thus we can view a Thom class as lying in H\u0003—E; E − L p– , and similarly for the bun- dles Ej . We have projections ˇj : E!Ej via the projections V0 \b V1 \b \u0001\u0001\u0001 \b Vm!Vj in ﬁbers. If ˝j 2 H\u0003—Ej;Ej − Lp– denotes the Thom class constructed above, then we have the pullback ˇ \u0003 j —˝j– 2 H\u0003( E; E − ˇ −1 j —L p–\u0001 , and the cup product Q j ˇ \u0003 j —˝j– in H\u0003—E; E − Lp– is a Thom class for E , as one sees by applying the calculation at the end of Example 3.11 in each ﬁber. Under the isomorphism H\u0003—E; E − Lp– ˇ eH\u0003—T —E–– , the class Q j ˇ \u0003 j —˝j– corresponds to \u0006\u0015—\u000b– since both classes restrict to \u0006\u000b ⊗p in each ﬁber S p ˆ T—E– and \u0015—\u000b– is uniquely determined by its restriction to ﬁbers. Now we can ﬁnish the proof of the lemma. The class r \u0003—\u0015—\u000b–– is obtained by restricting \u0015—\u000b– 2 Hp—T —E–– to the diagonal T—E0– , then pulling back to L p \u0002 S 1 via the quotient map Lp \u0002 S 1!T—E0– which collapses the section at inﬁnity to a point. Restricting Q j ˇ \u0003 j —˝j– to Hp—E0;E0 − Lp– ˇ Hp—T —E0–– gives ˝0 ` e1 ` \u0001\u0001\u0001 ` em where ej 2 H2—E0– is the image of ˝j under H2—Ej;Ej − L p–!H2—Ej– ˇ H2—Lp– ˇ H2—E0– , these last two isomorphisms coming from including Lp in Ej and E0 as the zero section, to which they deformation retract. To compute ej , we use the diagram Ej L p L p H 2 CP m CP m Ej ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡!¡¡¡! q q » f f » () H 2() H 2() H 2() CP m E ¡¡¡¡!

Following this class across the top of the diagram and then down to the lower left corner gives the element ej .To compute ej we take the alternate route through the lower right corner of the diagram. The image of the Thom class for E1 in the lower right H2—CPm– is the generator γ Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 513 since T—E1– … CPm‡1 . The map f \u0003 is multiplication by j since f has degree j on CP1 ˆ CPm . And q\u0003—γ– …\u0006!2 since q restricts to a homeomorphism on the 2 cell of L p in the CW structure deﬁned in Example 2.43. Thus ej …\u0006j!2 , and so ˝0 ` e1 ` \u0001\u0001\u0001 ` em …\u0006m!˝0 ` ! m 2 …\u0006m!˝0 ` !p−1 . Since ˝0 was the pullback of \u000b via the projection T—E0–!S 1 , when we pull ˝0 back to L p \u0002 S 1 via r we get 1 ⊗ \u000b , so ˝0 ` e1 ` \u0001\u0001\u0001 ` em pulls back to \u0006m!!p−1 ⊗ \u000b . Hence a1 …\u0006m!. tu The lemma implies in particular that an is not zero in Zp ,so an has a multi- plicative inverse a−1 n in Zp . We then deﬁne P i—\u000b– … —−1– ia −1 n \u00122i—p−1–—\u000b– for \u000b 2 Hn—X– The factor a−1 n guarantees that P 0 is the identity. The factor —−1– i is inserted in order to make P i—\u000b– … \u000b p if j\u000bj… 2i , as we show next. We know that \u00122i—p−1–—\u000b– … \u000b p ,so what must be shown is that —−1–ia −1 2i … 1 , or equivalently, a2i … —−1– i . To do this we need a number theory fact: ( —p − 1–=2 \u0001 ! 2 \u0011 —−1– —p‡1–=2 mod p . To derive this, note ﬁrst that the product of all the elements \u00061; \u00062; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ; \u0006—p − 1–=2 of Z\u0003 p is ( —p − 1–=2 \u0001 ! 2—−1– —p−1–=2 . On the other hand, this group is cyclic of even order, so the product of all its elements is the unique element of order 2 , which is −1 , since all the other nontrivial elements cancel their inverses in this product. Thus ( —p − 1–=2 \u0001 !2—−1– —p−1–=2 \u0011−1 and hence ( —p − 1–=2 \u0001 ! 2 \u0011 —−1– —p‡1–=2 mod p . Using the formulas an … —−1– p—p−1–n—n−1–=4a n 1 and a1 …\u0006( —p − 1–=2 \u0001 ! we then have a2i … —−1– p—p−1–2i—2i−1–=4( —p − 1–=2 \u0001 !2i … —−1– pƒ—p−1–=2⁄i—2i−1–—−1– i—p‡1–=2 … —−1– i—p−1–=2—−1– i—p‡1–=2 since p and 2i − 1 are odd … —−1–ip … —−1– i since p is odd. Theorem 4L.16. The operations P i satisfy the properties (1)–(6) and the Adem rela- tions. Proof: The ﬁrst two properties, naturality and additivity, along with the fact that P i—\u000b– … 0if2i> j\u000bj , are inherited from the \u0012i ’s. Property (6) and the other half of (5) have just been shown above. For the Cartan formula we have, for \u000b 2 Hm and \f 2 Hn , \u0015—\u000b ` \f– … —−1– p—p−1–mn=2\u0015—\u000b–\u0015—\f– and hence X i !—p−1–—m‡n–−i ⊗ \u0012i—\u000b ` \f– … —−1– p—p−1–mn=2\u0010X j !—p−1–m−j ⊗ \u0012j—\u000b– \u0011\u0010X k !—p−1–n−k ⊗ \u0012k—\f– \u0011 Recall that !2r … ! r 2 and !2r ‡1 … !1! r 2 , with ! 2 1 … 0 . Therefore terms with i even on the left side of the equation can only come from terms with j and k even on the 514 Chapter 4 Homotopy Theory right side. This leads to the second equality in the following sequence: P i—\u000b ` \f– … —−1– ia −1 m‡n\u00122i—p−1–—\u000b ` \f– … —−1–ia −1 m‡n—−1– p—p−1–mn=2 X j \u00122—i−j–—p−1–—\u000b–\u00122j—p−1–—\f– … X j—−1– i−ja −1 m \u00122—i−j–—p−1–—\u000b–—−1– ja −1 n \u00122j—p−1–—\f– … X j P i−j—\u000b–P j—\f– Property (4), the invariance of P i under suspension, follows from the Cartan formula just as in the case p … 2 , using the fact that P 0 is the only P i that can be nonzero on 1 dimensional classes, by (5). It remains to prove the Adem relations for Steenrod powers. We will need a Bockstein calculation: Lemma 4L.17. \f\u00122k …−\u00122k‡1 . Proof: Let us ﬁrst reduce the problem to showing that \fr \u0003—\u0015—\u0013–– … 0 . If we compute \fr\u0003—\u0015—\u0013–– using the product formula for \f ,weget \f \u0010X i !—p−1–n−i ⊗ \u0012i—\u0013– \u0011 … X i \u0010\f!—p−1–n−i ⊗ \u0012i—\u0013– ‡ —−1–i!—p−1–n−i ⊗ \f\u0012i—\u0013– \u0011 Since \f!2j−1 … !2j and \f!2j … 0 , the terms with i … 2k and i … 2k ‡ 1 give Pk !—p−1–n−2k ⊗ \f\u00122k—\u0013– and Pk !—p−1–n−2k ⊗ \u00122k‡1—\u0013– − P k !—p−1–n−2k−1 ⊗ \f\u00122k‡1—\u0013– , respectively. Thus the coefﬁcient of !—p−1–n−2k in \fr \u0003—\u0015—\u0013–– is \f\u00122k—\u0013–‡\u00122k‡1—\u0013– ,so if we assume that \fr\u0003—\u0015—\u0013–– … 0 , this coefﬁcient must vanish since we are in the ten- sor product H\u0003—L1– ⊗ H\u0003—Kn– . Soweget \f\u00122k—\u0013– …−\u00122k‡1—\u0013– and hence \f\u00122k—\u000b– … −\u00122k‡1—\u000b– for all \u000b . Note that \f\u00122k‡1 … 0 from the coefﬁcient of !—p−1–n−2k−1 . This also follows from the formula \f\u00122k …−\u00122k‡1 since \f 2 … 0. In order to show that \fr\u0003—\u0015—\u0013–– … 0 we ﬁrst compute \f\u0015—\u0013– . We may assume Kn has a single n cell and a single —n ‡ 1– cell, attached by a map of degree p . Let ' and be the cellular cochains assigning the value 1 to the n cell and the —n‡1– cell, respectively, so \u000e' … p .In K^p n we then have —\u0003– \u000e—'⊗p– … X i—−1– in'⊗i ⊗ \u000e' ⊗ '⊗—p−i−1– … p X i—−1– in'⊗i ⊗ ⊗ '⊗—p−i−1– where the tensor notation means cellular cross product, so for example '⊗p is the cellular cochain dual to the np cell en \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0002 en of K^p n . The formula —\u0003– holds also in ÓKn since the latter space has only one —np ‡ 1– cell not in K^p n , with cellular boundary zero. Namely, this cell is the product of the 1 cell of L 1 and the np cell of K^p n with one end of this product attached to the np cell by the identity map and the other end by the cyclic permutation T , which has degree ‡1 since p is odd, so these two terms in the boundary of this cell cancel, and there are no other terms since the rest of the attachment of this cell is at the basepoint. Bockstein homomorphisms can be computed using cellular cochain complexes, so the formula —\u0003– says that Pi—−1– in'⊗i ⊗ ⊗ '⊗—p−i−1– represents \f\u0015—\u0013– . Via the Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 515 quotient map Ð Kn!ÓKn , the class \u0015—\u0013– pulls back to a class γ—\u0013– with \fγ—\u0013– also rep- resented by Pi—−1– in'⊗i ⊗ ⊗ '⊗—p−i−1– . To see what happens when we pull \fγ—\u0013– back to \fr\u0003—\u0015—\u0013–– via the inclusion L1 \u0002 Kn > Ð Kn , consider the commutative di- agram at the right. In the left- LKH () ¤ ¤ 1 £ n SKH () ¤ 1 £ n LKH () ¤ 1 £ n¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¼ ¿ KH () ¤ ¤ n SKH () ¤ 1 £ np¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡! ¼ ¿¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡!¡ KH () ¤ n¡¡¡¡¡!¡ ^ hand square the maps ˇ \u0003 are induced by the covering space projections ˇ : S 1 \u0002 K^p n !Ð Kn and ˇ : S 1 \u0002 Kn!L 1 \u0002 Kn arising from the free Zp actions. The vertical maps are in- duced by the diagonal inclusion S 1 \u0002 K > S 1 \u0002 K^p n . The maps ˝ are the transfer homomorphisms deﬁned in x3.G. Recall the deﬁnition: If ˇ : eX!X is a p sheeted covering space, a chain map C\u0003—X–!C\u0003— eX– is deﬁned by sending a singular simplex ˙ : Ñk!X to the sum of its p lifts to eX , and ˝ is the induced map on cohomology. The key property of ˝ is that ˝ˇ \u0003 : H\u0003—X–!H\u0003—X– is multiplication by p , for any choice of coefﬁcient group, since when we project the p lifts of ˙ : Ñ k!X back to X we get p˙ . When X is a CW complex and eX is given the lifted CW structure, then ˝ can also be deﬁned in cellular cohomology by the same procedure. Let us compute the value of the upper ˝ in the diagram on 1 ⊗ ⊗ '⊗—p−1– where ‘ 1 ’ is the cellular cocycle assigning the value 1 to each 0 cell of S 1 . By the deﬁnition of ˝ we have ˝—1 ⊗ ⊗ '⊗—p−1–– … P i T i— ⊗ '⊗—p−1–– where T : K^p n !K^p n permutes the factors cyclically. It does not matter whether T moves coordinates one unit left- wards or one unit rightwards since we are summing over all the powers of T , so let us say T moves coordinates rightward. Then T— ⊗ '⊗—p−1–– … ' ⊗ ⊗ '⊗—p−2– , with the last ' moved into the ﬁrst position. This move is achieved by transposing this ' with each of the preceding p − 2 ' ’s and with . Transposing two ' ’s introduces a sign —−1–n2 , and transposing ' with introduces a sign —−1– n—n‡1– …‡1, by the commutativity property of cross product. Thus the total sign introduced by T is —−1–n2—p−2– , which equals —−1– n since p is odd.

The map ˇ \u0003 in the lower row is obviously onto since S 1 is contractible, so r\u0003—\f\u0015—\u0013–– is in the image of the composition ˝ˇ \u0003 across the bottom of the diagram. But this composition is multiplication by p , which is zero for Zp coefﬁcients, so \fr \u0003—\u0015—\u0013–– …r \u0003—\f\u0015—\u0013–– … 0. tu The derivation of the Adem relations now follows the pattern for the case p … 2.

Of the ﬁve summations, only the ﬁrst has both ! terms with even subscripts, namely r … 2m—pn − 2i– and s … 2m—pn − 2`– , so the coefﬁcient of !r ⊗ !s in this summation must be symmetric with respect to switching i and ` , up to a sign which will be ‡ if we choose n to be even, as we will do.

Steenrod Squares and Powers Section 4.L 517 To get the ﬁrst Adem relation from (1) we choose n and ` so that the left side of (1) has only one term, namely we take n … 2—1 ‡ p ‡\u0001\u0001\u0001 ‡ pr −1– ‡ 2s and ` … mn ‡ s for given integers r and s .

This shows the ﬁrst Adem relation holds for the class \u0013 , and the general case follows as in the case p … 2. To get the second Adem relation we choose n … 2pr ‡ 2s and ` … mn ‡ s .

A few related facts about manifolds are also proved. Let us ﬁrst recall from Chapter 0 that a CW complex is a space X constructed in the following way: (1) Start with a discrete set X0 , the 0 cells of X . (2) Inductively, form the n skeleton Xn from Xn−1 by attaching n cells en \u000b via maps '\u000b : S n−1!Xn−1 . This means that Xn is the quotient space of Xn−1` \u000b Dn \u000b under the identiﬁcations x ˘ '\u000b—x– for x 2 @Dn \u000b . The cell en \u000b is the homeomorphic image of Dn \u000b − @Dn \u000b under the quotient map. (3) X … S n Xn with the weak topology: A set A ˆ X is open (or closed) iff A \\ Xn is open (or closed) in Xn for each n . Note that condition (3) is superﬂuous when X is ﬁnite-dimensional, so that X … Xn for some n . For if A is open in X … Xn , the deﬁnition of the quotient topology on Xn implies that A \\ Xn−1 is open in Xn−1 , and then by the same reasoning A \\ Xn−2 is open in Xn−2 , and similarly for all the skeleta Xn−i . Each cell en \u000b has its characteristic map Ø\u000b , which is by deﬁnition the composi- tion Dn \u000b > Xn−1` \u000b Dn \u000b!Xn > X . This is continuous since it is a composition of continuous maps, the inclusion Xn > X being continuous by (3). The restriction of Ø\u000b to the interior of Dn \u000b is a homeomorphism onto en \u000b . An alternative way to describe the topology on X is to say that a set A ˆ X is open (or closed) iff Ø−1 \u000b —A– is open (or closed) in Dn \u000b for each characteristic map Ø\u000b . In one direction this follows from continuity of the Ø\u000b ’s, and in the other direction, suppose Ø−1 \u000b —A– is open in Dn \u000b for each Ø\u000b , and suppose by induction on n that A \\ Xn−1 is open in Xn−1 . Then since Ø−1 \u000b —A– is open in Dn \u000b for all \u000b , A \\ Xn is open in Xn by the deﬁnition of the quotient topology on Xn . Hence by (3), A is open in X . A consequence of this characterization of the topology on X is that X is a quotient space of ` n;\u000b Dn \u000b . 520 Appendix Topology of Cell Complexes A subcomplex of a CW complex X is a subspace A ˆ X which is a union of cells of X , such that the closure of each cell in A is contained in A . Thus for each cell in A , the image of its attaching map is contained in A ,so A is itself a CW complex. Its CW complex topology is the same as the topology induced from X , as one sees by noting inductively that the two topologies agree on A n … A \\ Xn . It is easy to see by induction over skeleta that a subcomplex is a closed subspace. Conversely, a subcomplex could be deﬁned as a closed subspace which is a union of cells. A ﬁnite CW complex, that is, one with only ﬁnitely many cells, is compact since attaching a single cell preserves compactness. A sort of converse to this is: Proposition A.1. A compact subspace of a CW complex is contained in a ﬁnite sub- complex. Proof: First we show that a compact set C in a CW complex X can meet only ﬁnitely many cells of X . Suppose on the contrary that there is an inﬁnite sequence of points xi 2 C all lying in distinct cells. Then the set S …fx1;x2; \u0001\u0001\u0001g is closed in X . Namely, assuming S \\ Xn−1 is closed in Xn−1 by induction on n , then for each cell en \u000b of X , '−1 \u000b —S– is closed in @Dn \u000b , and Ø−1 \u000b —S– consists of at most one more point in Dn \u000b ,so Ø−1 \u000b —S– is closed in Dn \u000b . Therefore S \\Xn is closed in Xn for each n , hence S is closed in X . The same argument shows that any subset of S is closed, so S has the discrete topology. But it is compact, being a closed subset of the compact set C . Therefore S must be ﬁnite, a contradiction. Since C is contained in a ﬁnite union of cells, it sufﬁces to show that a ﬁnite union of cells is contained in a ﬁnite subcomplex of X . A ﬁnite union of ﬁnite sub- complexes is again a ﬁnite subcomplex, so this reduces to showing that a single cell en \u000b is contained in a ﬁnite subcomplex. The image of the attaching map '\u000b for en \u000b is com- pact, hence by induction on dimension this image is contained in a ﬁnite subcomplex A ˆ Xn−1 .So en \u000b is contained in the ﬁnite subcomplex A [ en \u000b . tu Now we can explain the mysterious letters ‘CW,’ which refer to the following two properties satisﬁed by CW complexes: (1) Closure-ﬁniteness: The closure of each cell meets only ﬁnitely many other cells. This follows from the preceding proposition since the closure of a cell is compact, being the image of a characteristic map. (2) Weak topology: A set is closed iff it meets the closure of each cell in a closed set. For if a set meets the closure of each cell in a closed set, it pulls back to a closed set under each characteristic map, hence is closed by an earlier remark. In J. H. C. Whitehead’s original deﬁnition of CW complexes these two properties played a more central role. The following proposition contains essentially this deﬁnition. Topology of Cell Complexes Appendix 521 Proposition A.2. Given a Hausdorff space X and a family of maps Ø\u000b : Dn \u000b!X , then these maps are the characteristic maps of a CW complex structure on X iff : (i) Each Ø\u000b is injective on int Dn \u000b , hence Ø\u000b restricts to a homeomorphism from int Dn \u000b onto a cell en \u000b ˆ X . All these cells are disjoint, and their union is X . (ii) For each cell en \u000b , Ø\u000b—@Dn \u000b– is contained in the union of a ﬁnite number of cells of dimension less than n . (iii) A subset of X is closed iff it meets the closure of each cell of X in a closed set. The ‘hence’ in (i) follows from the fact that Ø\u000b maps the compact set Dn \u000b to a Hausdorff space, so since Ø\u000b takes compact sets to compact sets, it takes closed sets to closed sets, which means that Ø−1 \u000b : en \u000b! int Dn \u000b is continuous. By the same compactness argument, condition (iii) can be restated as saying that a set C ˆ X is closed iff Ø−1 \u000b —C– is closed in Dn \u000b for all \u000b . In particular, (iii) is automatic if there are only ﬁnitely many cells since the projection ` \u000b Dn \u000b!X is a map from a compact space onto a Hausdorff space, hence is a quotient map. For an example where all the conditions except the ﬁniteness hypothesis in (ii) are satisﬁed, take X to be D2 with its interior as a 2 cell and each point of @D2 as a0 cell. The identity map of D2 serves as the Ø\u000b for the 2 cell. Condition (iii) is satisﬁed since it is a nontrivial condition only for the 2 cell. Proof: We have already taken care of the ‘only if’ implication. For the converse, suppose inductively that Xn−1 , the union of all cells of dimension less than n ,is a CW complex with the appropriate Ø\u000b ’s as characteristic maps. The induction can start with X−1 …; . Let f : Xn−1` \u000b Dn \u000b!Xn be given by the inclusion on Xn−1 and the maps Ø\u000b for all the n cells of X . This is a continuous surjection, and if we can show it is a quotient map, then Xn will be obtained from Xn−1 by attaching the n cells en \u000b . Thus if C ˆ Xn is such that f −1—C– is closed, we need to show that C \\ e m \f is closed for all cells em \f of X , the bar denoting closure. There are three cases. If m< n then f −1—C– closed implies C \\ Xn−1 closed, hence C \\ e m \f is closed since e m \f ˆ Xn−1 .If m … n then em \f is one of the cells en \u000b ,so f −1—C– closed implies f −1—C– \\ Dn \u000b is closed, hence compact, hence its image C \\ e n \u000b under f is compact and therefore closed. Finally there is the case m> n . Then C ˆ Xn implies C \\ e m \f ˆ Ø\f—@Dm \f – . The latter space is contained in a ﬁnite union of e ` γ ’s with `< m . By induction on m , each C \\ e ` γ is closed. Hence the intersection of C with the union of the ﬁnite collection of e ` γ ’s is closed. Intersecting this closed set with e m \f , we conclude that C \\ e m \f is closed. It remains only to check that X has the weak topology with respect to the Xn ’s, that is, a set in X is closed iff it intersects each Xn in a closed set. The preceding argument with C … Xn shows that Xn is closed, so a closed set intersects each Xn in a closed set. Conversely, if a set C intersects Xn in a closed set, then C intersects each e n \u000b in a closed set, so C is closed in X by (iii). tu 522 Appendix Topology of Cell Complexes Next we describe a convenient way of constructing open neighborhoods N\"—A– of subsets A of a CW complex X , where \" is a function assigning a number \"\u000b > 0 to each cell en \u000b of X . The construction is inductive over the skeleta Xn , so suppose we have already constructed N n \" —A– , a neighborhood of A \\ Xn in Xn , starting the process with N 0 \" —A– … A \\ X0 . Then we deﬁne N n‡1 \" —A– by specifying its preimage under the characteristic map Ø\u000b : Dn‡1!X of each cell en‡1 \u000b , namely, Ø−1 \u000b ( N n‡1 \" —A– \u0001 is the union of two parts: an open \"\u000b neighborhood of Ø−1 \u000b —A– − @Dn‡1 in Dn‡1 − @Dn‡1 , and a product —1 − \"\u000b; 1⁄\u0002 Ø−1 \u000b ( N n \" —A– \u0001 with respect to ‘spherical’ coordinates —r ; \u0012– in Dn‡1 , where r 2 ƒ0; 1⁄ is the radial coordinate and \u0012 lies in @Dn‡1 … S n . Then we deﬁne N\"—A– … S n N n \" —A– . This is an open set in X since it pulls back to an open set under each characteristic map. Proposition A.3. CW complexes are normal, and in particular, Hausdorff. Proof: Points are closed in a CW complex X since they pull back to closed sets under all characteristic maps Ø\u000b . For disjoint closed sets A and B in X , we show that N\"—A– and N\"—B– are disjoint for small enough \"\u000b ’s. In the inductive process for building these open sets, assume N n \" —A– and N n \" —B– have been chosen to be disjoint. For a characteristic map Ø\u000b : Dn‡1!X , observe that Ø−1 \u000b ( N n \" —A– \u0001 and Ø−1 \u000b —B– are a positive distance apart, since otherwise by compactness we would have a sequence in Ø−1 \u000b —B– converging to a point of Ø−1 \u000b —B– in @Dn‡1 of distance zero from Ø−1 \u000b ( N n \" —A– \u0001 , but this is impossible since Ø−1 \u000b ( N n \" —B– \u0001 is a neighborhood of Ø−1 \u000b —B– \\ @Dn‡1 in @Dn‡1 disjoint from Ø−1 \u000b ( N n \" —A– \u0001 . Similarly, Ø−1 \u000b ( N n \" —B– \u0001 and Ø−1 \u000b —A– are a positive distance apart. Also, Ø−1 \u000b —A– and Ø−1 \u000b —B– are a positive distance apart. So a small enough \"\u000b will make Ø−1 \u000b ( N n‡1 \" —A– \u0001 disjoint from Ø−1 \u000b ( N n‡1 \" —B– \u0001 in Dn‡1 . tu Proposition A.4. Each point in a CW complex has arbitrarily small contractible open neighborhoods, so CW complexes are locally contractible. Proof: Given a point x in a CW complex X and a neighborhood U of x in X ,we can choose the \"\u000b ’s small enough so that N\"—x– ˆ U by requiring that the closure of N n \" —x– be contained in U for each n . It remains to see that N\"—x– is contractible. If x 2 Xm − Xm−1 and n>m we can construct a deformation retraction of N n \" —x– onto N n−1 \" —x– by sliding outward along radial segments in cells en \f , the images under the characteristic maps Ø\f of radial segments in Dn . A deformation retraction of N\"—x– onto N m \" —x– is then obtained by performing the deformation retraction of N n \" —x– onto N n−1 \" —x– during the t interval ƒ1=2 n; 1=2 n−1⁄ , points of N n \" —x–−N n−1 \" —x– being stationary outside this t interval. Finally, N m \" —x– is an open ball about x , and so deformation retracts onto x . tu In particular, CW complexes are locally path-connected. So a CW complex is path- connected iff it is connected. Topology of Cell Complexes Appendix 523 Proposition A.5. For a subcomplex A of a CW complex X , the open neighborhood N\"—A– deformation retracts onto A if \"\u000b < 1 for all \u000b . Proof: In each cell of X − A , N\"—A– is a product neighborhood of the boundary of this cell, so a deformation retraction of N\"—A– onto A can be constructed just as in the previous proof. tu Note that for subcomplexes A and B of X , we have N\"—A– \\ N\"—B– … N\"—A \\ B– . This implies for example that the van Kampen theorem and Mayer-Vietoris sequences hold for decompositions X … A [ B into subcomplexes A and B as well as into open sets A and B . A map f : X!Y with domain a CW complex is continuous iff its restrictions to the closures e n \u000b of all cells en \u000b are continuous, and it is useful to know that the same is true for homotopies ft : X!Y . With this objective in mind, let us introduce a little terminology. A topological space X is said to be generated by a collection of subspaces X\u000b if X … S \u000b X\u000b and a set A ˆ X is closed iff A \\ X\u000b is closed in X\u000b for each \u000b . Equivalently, we could say ‘open’ instead of ‘closed’ here, but ‘closed’ is more convenient for our present purposes. As noted earlier, though not in these words, a CW complex X is generated by the closures e n \u000b of its cells en \u000b . Since every ﬁnite subcomplex of X is a ﬁnite union of closures e n \u000b , X is also generated by its ﬁnite subcomplexes. It follows that X is also generated by its compact subspaces, or more brieﬂy, X is compactly generated. Proposition A.15 later in the Appendix asserts that if X is a compactly generated Hausdorff space and Z is locally compact, then X \u0002 Z , with the product topology, is compactly generated. In particular, X \u0002 I is compactly generated if X is a CW complex. Since every compact set in X \u0002 I is contained in the product of a compact subspace of X with I , hence in the product of a ﬁnite subcomplex of X with I , such product subspaces also generate X \u0002 I . Since such a product subspace is a ﬁnite union of products e n \u000b \u0002 I , it is also true that X \u0002 I is generated by its subspaces e n \u000b \u0002 I . This implies that a homotopy F : X \u0002 I!Y is continuous iff its restrictions to the subspaces e n \u000b \u0002 I are continuous, which is the statement we were seeking. Products of CW Complexes There are some unexpected point-set-topological subtleties that arise with prod- ucts of CW complexes. As we shall show, the product of two CW complexes does have a natural CW structure, but its topology is in general ﬁner, with more open sets, than the product topology. However, the distinctions between the two topologies are rather small, and indeed nonexistent in most cases of interest, so there is no real problem for algebraic topology. Given a space X and a collection of subspaces X\u000b whose union is X , these sub- spaces generate a possibly ﬁner topology on X by deﬁning a set A ˆ X to be open 524 Appendix Topology of Cell Complexes iff A \\ X\u000b is open in X\u000b for all \u000b . The axioms for a topology are easily veriﬁed for this deﬁnition. In case fX\u000bg is the collection of compact subsets of X , we write Xc for this new compactly generated topology. It is easy to see that X and Xc have the same compact subsets, and the two induced topologies on these compact subsets co- incide. If X is compact, or even locally compact, then X … Xc , that is, X is compactly generated. Theorem A.6. For CW complexes X and Y with characteristic maps Ø\u000b and Ù\f , the product maps Ø\u000b \u0002 Ù\f are the characteristic maps for a CW complex structure on —X \u0002 Y–c . If either X or Y is compact or more generally locally compact, then —X \u0002 Y–c … X \u0002 Y . Also, —X \u0002 Y–c … X \u0002 Y if both X and Y have countably many cells. Proof: For the ﬁrst statement it sufﬁces to check that the three conditions in Propo- sition A.2 are satisﬁed when we take the space ‘ X ’ there to be —X \u0002 Y–c . The ﬁrst two conditions are obvious. For the third, which says that —X \u0002 Y–c is generated by the products e m \u000b \u0002 e n \f , observe that every compact set in X \u0002 Y is contained in the prod- uct of its projections onto X and Y , and these projections are compact and hence contained in ﬁnite subcomplexes of X and Y , so the original compact set is contained in a ﬁnite union of products e m \u000b \u0002 e n \f . Hence the products e m \u000b \u0002 e n \f generate —X \u0002 Y–c . The second assertion of the theorem is a special case of Proposition A.15, hav- ing nothing to do with CW complexes, which says that a product X \u0002 Y is compactly generated if X is compactly generated Hausdorff and Y is locally compact. For the last statement of the theorem, suppose X and Y each have at most count- ably many cells. For an open set W ˆ —X \u0002 Y–c and a point —a; b– 2 W we need to ﬁnd a product U \u0002 V ˆ W with U an open neighborhood of a in X and V an open neigh- borhood of b in Y . Choose ﬁnite subcomplexes X1 ˆ X2 ˆ \u0001\u0001\u0001 of X with X … S i Xi , and similarly for Y . We may assume a 2 X1 and b 2 Y1 . Since the two topologies agree on X1 \u0002 Y1 , there is a compact product neighborhood K1 \u0002 L1 ˆ W of —a; b– in X1 \u0002 Y1 . Assuming inductively that Ki \u0002 Li ˆ W has been constructed in Xi \u0002 Yi , we would like to construct Ki‡1 \u0002 Li‡1 ˆ W as a compact neighborhood of Ki \u0002 Li in Xi‡1 \u0002 Yi‡1 . To do this, we ﬁrst choose for each x 2 Ki compact neighborhoods Kx of x in Xi‡1 and Lx of Li in Yi‡1 such that Kx \u0002 Lx ˆ W , using the compactness of Li . By compactness of Ki , a ﬁnite number of the Kx ’s cover Ki . Let Ki‡1 be the union of these Kx ’s and let Li‡1 be the intersection of the corresponding Lx ’s. This deﬁnes the desired Ki‡1 \u0002 Li‡1 . Let Ui be the interior of Ki in Xi ,so Ui ˆ Ui‡1 for each i . The union U … Si Ui is then open in X since it intersects each Xi in a union of open sets and the Xi ’s generate X . In the same way the Li ’s yield an open set V in Y . Thus we have a product of open sets U \u0002 V ˆ W containing —a; b– . tu We will describe now an example from [Dowker 1952] where the product topology on X \u0002 Y differs from the CW topology. Both X and Y will be graphs consisting of Topology of Cell Complexes Appendix 525 inﬁnitely many edges emanating from a single vertex, with uncountably many edges for X and countably many for Y . Let X … W s Is where Is is a copy of the interval ƒ0; 1⁄ and the index s ranges over all inﬁnite sequences s … —s1;s2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– of positive integers. The wedge sum is formed at the 0 endpoint of Is . Similarly we let Y … W j Ij but with j varying just over positive integers. Let psj be the point —1=sj; 1=sj– 2 Is \u0002 Ij ˆ X \u0002 Y and let P be the union of all these points psj . Thus P consists of a single point in each 2 cell of X \u0002 Y ,so P is closed in the CW topology on X \u0002 Y . We will show it is not closed in the product topology by showing that —x0;y0– lies in its closure, where x0 is the common endpoint of the intervals Is and y0 is the common endpoint of the intervals Ij . A basic open set containing —x0;y0– in the product topology has the form U \u0002 V where U … W s ƒ0;as– and V … W j ƒ0;bj– . It sufﬁces to show that P has nonempty intersection with U \u0002 V . Choose a sequence t … —t1;t2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– with tj >j and tj > 1=bj for all j , and choose an integer k> 1=at . Then tk >k> 1=at hence 1=tk <at .We also have 1=tk <bk .So —1=tk; 1=tk– is a point of P that lies in ƒ0;at–\u0002 ƒ0;bk– and hence in U \u0002 V . Euclidean Neighborhood Retracts At certain places in this book it is desirable to know that a given compact space is a retract of a ﬁnite simplicial complex, or equivalently (as we shall see) a retract of a neighborhood in some Euclidean space. For example, this condition occurs in the Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem, and it was used in the proof of Alexander duality. So let us study this situation in more detail. Theorem A.7. A compact subspace K of R n is a retract of some neighborhood iff K is locally contractible in the weak sense that for each x 2 K and each neighborhood U of x in K there exists a neighborhood V ˆ U of x such that the inclusion V > U is nullhomotopic. Note that if K is a retract of some neighborhood, then it is a retract of every smaller neighborhood, just by restriction of the retraction. So it does not matter if we require the neighborhoods to be open. Similarly it does not matter if the neighbor- hoods U and V in the statement of the theorem are required to be open. Proof: Let us do the harder half ﬁrst, constructing a retraction of a neighborhood of K onto K under the local contractibility assumption. The ﬁrst step is to put a CW structure on the open set X … R n − K , with the size of the cells approaching zero near K . Consider the subdivision of R n into unit cubes of dimension n with vertices at the points with integer coordinates. Call this collection of cubes C0 . For an integer k> 0 , we can subdivide the cubes of C0 by taking n dimensional cubes of edgelength 1=2k with vertices having coordinates of the form i=2 k for i 2 Z . Denote this collection of cubes by Ck . Let A0 ˆ C0 be the set of cubes disjoint from K , and 526 Appendix Topology of Cell Complexes inductively, let Ak ˆ Ck be the set of cubes disjoint from K and not contained in cubes of Aj for j< k . The open set X is then the union of all the cubes in the combined collection A … S k Ak . Note that the collection A is locally ﬁnite: Each point of X has a neighborhood meeting only ﬁnitely many cubes in A , since the point has a positive distance from the closed set K . If two cubes of A intersect, their intersection is an i dimensional face of one of them for some i<n . Likewise, when two faces of cubes of A intersect, their intersection is a face of one of them. This implies that the open faces of cubes of A that are minimal with respect to inclusion among such faces form the cells of a CW structure on X , since the boundary of such a face is a union of such faces. The vertices of this CW structure are thus the vertices of all the cubes of A , and the n cells are the interiors of the cubes of A . Next we deﬁne inductively a subcomplex Z of this CW structure on X and a map r : Z!K . The 0 cells of Z are exactly the 0 cells of X , and we let r send each 0 cell to the closest point of K , or if this is not unique, any one of the closest points of K . Assume inductively that Z k and r : Z k!K have been deﬁned. For a cell ek‡1 of X with boundary in Z k , if the restriction of r to this boundary extends over ek‡1 then we include ek‡1 in Z k‡1 and we let r on ek‡1 be such an extension that is not too large, say an extension for which the diameter of its image r—ek‡1– is less than twice the inﬁmum of the diameters for all possible extensions. This deﬁnes Z k‡1 and r : Z k‡1!K . At the end of the induction we set Z … Z n . It remains to verify that by letting r equal the identity on K we obtain a contin- uous retraction Z [ K!K , and that Z [ K contains a neighborhood of K . Given a point x 2 K , let U be a ball in the metric space K centered at x . Since K is locally contractible, we can choose a ﬁnite sequence of balls in K centered at x , of the form U … Un ˙ Vn ˙ Un−1 ˙ Vn−1 ˙\u0001\u0001\u0001 ˙ U0 ˙ V0 , each ball having radius equal to some small fraction of the radius of the preceding one, and with Vi contractible in Ui . Let B ˆ Rn be a ball centered at x with radius less than half the radius of V0 , and let Y be the subcomplex of X formed by the cells whose closures are contained in B . Thus Y [ K contains a neighborhood of x in Rn . By the choice of B and the deﬁnition of r on 0 cells we have r—Y 0– ˆ V0 . Since V0 is contractible in U0 , r is deﬁned on the 1 cells of Y . Also, r—Y 1– ˆ V1 by the deﬁnition of r on 1 cells and the fact that U0 is much smaller than V1 . Similarly, by induction we have r deﬁned on Y i with r—Y i– ˆ Vi for all i . In particular, r maps Y to U . Since U could be arbitrarily small, this shows that extending r by the identity map on K gives a continuous map r : Z [ K!K . And since Y ˆ Z , we see that Z [ K contains a neighborhood of K by the earlier observation that Y [ K contains a neighborhood of x . Thus r : Z [ K!K retracts a neighborhood of K onto K . Now for the converse. Since open sets in Rn are locally contractible, it sufﬁces to show that a retract of a locally contractible space is locally contractible. Let r : X!A Topology of Cell Complexes Appendix 527 be a retraction and let U ˆ A be a neighborhood of a given point x 2 A .If X is locally contractible, then inside the open set r −1—U– there is a neighborhood V of x that is contractible in r −1—U– , say by a homotopy ft : V!r −1—U– . Then V \\ A is contractible in U via the restriction of the composition rft . tu A space X is called a Euclidean neighborhood retract or ENR if for some n there exists an embedding i : X > R n such that i—X– is a retract of some neighborhood in Rn . The preceding theorem implies that the existence of the retraction is independent of the choice of embedding, at least when X is compact. Corollary A.8. A compact space is an ENR iff it can be embedded as a retract of a ﬁnite simplicial complex. Hence the homology groups and the fundamental group of a compact ENR are ﬁnitely generated. Proof: A ﬁnite simplicial complex K with n vertices is a subcomplex of a simplex Ñn−1 , and hence embeds in R n . The preceding theorem then implies that K is a retract of some neighborhood in Rn , so any retract of K is also a retract of such a neighborhood, via the composition of the two retractions. Conversely, let K be a com- pact space that is a retract of some open neighborhood U in R n . Since K is compact it is bounded, lying in some large simplex Ñn ˆ R n . Subdivide Ñ n , say by repeated barycentric subdivision, so that all simplices of the subdivision have diameter less than the distance from K to the complement of U . Then the union of all the sim- plices in this subdivision that intersect K is a ﬁnite simplicial complex that retracts onto K via the restriction of the retraction U!K . tu Corollary A.9. Every compact manifold, with or without boundary, is an ENR. Proof: Manifolds are locally contractible, so it sufﬁces to show that a compact man- ifold M can be embedded in R k for some k .If M is not closed, it embeds in the closed manifold obtained from two copies of M by identifying their boundaries. So it sufﬁces to consider the case that M is closed. By compactness there exist ﬁnitely many closed balls Bn i ˆ M whose interiors cover M , where n is the dimension of M . Let fi : M!S n be the quotient map collapsing the complement of the interior of Bn i to a point. These fi ’s are the components of a map f : M!—S n– m which is injective since if x and y are distinct points of M with x in the interior of Bn i , say, then fi—x– ﬂ fi—y– . Composing f with an embedding —S n–m > R k , for example the product of the standard embeddings S n > R n‡1 , we obtain a continuous injection M > Rk , and this is a homeomorphism onto its image since M is compact. tu Corollary A.10. Every ﬁnite CW complex is an ENR. Proof: Since CW complexes are locally contractible, it sufﬁces to show that a ﬁnite CW complex can be embedded in some R n . This is proved by induction on the number 528 Appendix Topology of Cell Complexes of cells. Suppose the CW complex X is obtained from a subcomplex A by attaching a cell ek via a map f : S k−1!A , and suppose that we have an embedding A > R m . Then we can embed X in Rk \u0002 Rm \u0002 R as the union of Dk \u0002f0g\u0002 f0g , f0g\u0002 A\u0002f1g , and all line segments joining points —x; 0; 0– and —0; f —x–; 1– for x 2 S k−1 . tu Spaces Dominated by CW Complexes We have been considering spaces which are retracts of ﬁnite simplicial complexes, and now we show that such spaces have the homotopy type of CW complexes. In fact, we can just as easily prove something a little more general than this. A space Y is said to be dominated by a space X if there are maps Y i-----! X r-----! Y with ri ' 11. This makes the notion of a retract into something that depends only on the homotopy types of the spaces involved. Proposition A.11. A space dominated by a CW complex is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. Proof: Recall from x3.F that the mapping telescope T—f1;f2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– of a sequence of maps X1 f1------------! X2 f2------------! X3 ------------! \u0001\u0001\u0001 is the quotient space of ` i( Xi \u0002 ƒi; i ‡ 1⁄\u0001 obtained by identifying —x; i ‡ 1– 2 Xi \u0002 ƒi; i ‡ 1⁄ with —f —x–; i ‡ 1– 2 Xi‡1 \u0002 ƒi ‡ 1;i ‡ 2⁄ .We shall need the following elementary facts: (1) T—f1;f2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ' T—g1;g2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– if fi ' gi for each i . (2) T—f1;f2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ' T—f2;f3; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . (3) T—f1;f2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ' T—f2f1;f4f3; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . The second of these is obvious. To prove the other two we will use Proposition 0.18, whose proof applies not just to CW pairs but to any pair —X1;A– for which there is a deformation retraction of X1 \u0002 I onto X1 \u0002f0g[ A\u0002 I . To prove (1) we regard T—f1;f2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– as being obtained from ` i( Xi \u0002fig\u0001 by attaching ` i( Xi \u0002 ƒi; i ‡ 1⁄\u0001 . Then we can obtain T—g1;g2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– by varying the attaching map by homotopy. To prove (3) we view T—f1;f2; \u0001\u0001\u0001– as obtained from the disjoint union of the mapping cylinders M—f2i– by attaching ` i( X2i−1 \u0002 ƒ2i − 1; 2i⁄ \u0001 . By sliding the attachment of X \u0002 ƒ2i − 1; 2i⁄ to X2i ˆ M—f2i– down the latter mapping cylinder to X2i‡1 we convert M—f2i−1– [ M—f2i– into M—f2if2i−1– [ M—f2i– . This last space deformation retracts onto M—f2if2i−1– . Doing this for all i gives the homotopy equivalence in (3). Now to prove the proposition, suppose that the space Y is dominated by the CW complex X via maps Y i-----! X r-----! Y with ri ' 11 . By (2) and (3) we have T —ir ; ir ; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ' T —r; i; r; i; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ' T —i; r ; i; r ; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ' T—r i; r i; \u0001\u0001\u0001– . Since ri ' 11, T—r i; r i; \u0001\u0001\u0001– is ho- motopy equivalent to the telescope of the identity maps Y!Y!Y! \u0001\u0001\u0001 , which is Y \u0002 ƒ0; 1– ' Y . On the other hand, the map ir is homotopic to a cellular map f : X!X ,so T —ir ; ir ; \u0001\u0001\u0001– ' T —f; f; \u0001\u0001\u0001– , which is a CW complex. tu The Compact-Open Topology Appendix 529 One might ask whether a space dominated by a ﬁnite CW complex is homotopy equivalent to a ﬁnite CW complex. In the simply-connected case this follows from Proposition 4C.1 since such a space has ﬁnitely generated homology groups. But there are counterexamples in the general case; see [Wall 1965]. In view of Corollary A.10 the preceding proposition implies: Corollary A.12. A compact manifold is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. tu One could ask more reﬁned questions. For example, do all compact manifolds have CW complex structures, or even simplicial complex structures? Answers here are considerably harder to come by. Restricting attention to closed manifolds for simplicity, the present status of these questions is the following. For manifolds of dimensions less than 4 , simplicial complex structures always exist. In dimension 4 there are closed manifolds that do not have simplicial complex structures, while the existence of CW structures is an open question. In dimensions greater than 4 , CW structures always exist, but whether simplicial structures always exist is unknown, though it is known that there are n manifolds not having simplicial structures locally isomorphic to any linear simplicial subdivision of R n , for all n \u0015 4 . For more on these questions, see [Kirby & Siebenmann 1977] and [Freedman & Quinn 1990]. Exercises 1. Show that a covering space of a CW complex is also a CW complex, with cells projecting homeomorphically onto cells. 2. Let X be a CW complex and x0 any point of X . Construct a new CW complex structure on X having x0 as a 0 cell, and having each of the original cells a union of the new cells. The latter condition is expressed by saying the new CW structure is a subdivision of the old one. 3. Show that a CW complex is path-connected iff its 1 skeleton is path-connected. 4. Show that a CW complex is locally compact iff each point has a neighborhood that meets only ﬁnitely many cells. 5. For a space X , show that the identity map Xc!X induces an isomorphism on ˇ1 , where Xc denotes X with the compactly generated topology. The Compact-Open Topology By deﬁnition, the compact-open topology on the space XY of maps f : Y!X has a subbasis consisting of the sets M—K; U – of mappings taking a compact set K ˆ Y to an open set U ˆ X . Thus a basis for XY consists of sets of maps taking a ﬁnite number of compact sets Ki ˆ Y to open sets Ui ˆ X .If Y is compact, which is the only case we consider in this book, convergence to f 2 XY means, loosely speaking, 530 Appendix The Compact-Open Topology that ﬁner and ﬁner compact covers fKig of Y are taken to smaller and smaller open covers fUig of f—Y– . One of the main cases of interest in homotopy theory is when Y … I ,so XI is the space of paths in X . In this case one can check that a system of basic neighborhoods of a path f : I!X consists of the open sets T i M—Ki;Ui– where the Ki ’s are a partition of I into nonoverlapping closed intervals and Ui is an open neighborhood of f—Ki– . The compact-open topology is the same as the topology of uniform convergence in many cases: Proposition A.13. If X is a metric space and Y is compact, then the compact-open topology on XY is the same as the metric topology deﬁned by the metric d—f ; g– … supy2Y d—f —y–; g—y–– . Proof: First we show that every open \" ball B\"—f – about f 2 XY contains a neigh- borhood of f in the compact-open topology. Since f—Y– is compact, it is covered by ﬁnitely many balls B\"=3( f—yi–\u0001 . Let Ki ˆ Y be the closure of f −1( B\"=3—f —yi––\u0001 ,so Ki is compact, Y … S i Ki , and f—Ki– ˆ B\"=2( f—yi–\u0001 … Ui , hence f 2 T i M—Ki;Ui– . To show that Ti M—Ki;Ui– ˆ B\"—f – , suppose that g 2 T i M—Ki;Ui– . For any y 2 Y , say y 2 Ki , we have d ( g—y–; f —yi–\u0001 <\"=2 since g—Ki– ˆ Ui . Likewise we have d ( f—y–; f —yi–\u0001 <\"=2, so d ( f —y–; g—y– \u0001 \u0014 d ( f—y–; f —yi–\u0001 ‡ d ( g—y–; f —yi–\u0001 <\" . Since y was arbitrary, this shows g 2 B\"—f – . Conversely, we show that for each open set M—K; U – and each f 2 M—K; U – there is a ball B\"—f – ˆ M—K; U – . Since f—K– is compact, it has a distance \"> 0 from the complement of U . Then d—f ; g– < \"=2 implies g—K– ˆ U since g—K– is contained in an \"=2 neighborhood of f—K– .So B\"=2—f – ˆ M—K; U – . tu The next proposition contains the essential properties of the compact-open topol- ogy from the viewpoint of algebraic topology. Proposition A.14. If Y is locally compact, then : (a) The evaluation map e : XY \u0002 Y!X , e—f ; y– … f—y– , is continuous. (b) A map f : Y \u0002 Z!X is continuous iff the map bf : Z!XY , bf —z–—y– … f—y; z– ,is continuous. In particular, part (b) provides the point-set topology justifying the adjoint re- lation hÖX; Y i…hX; ÚY i in x4.3, since it implies that a map ÖX!Y is continuous iff the associated map X!ÚY is continuous, and similarly for homotopies of such maps. Namely, think of a basepoint-preserving map ÖX!Y as a map f : I \u0002 X!Y taking @I \u0002 X [fx0g\u0002 I to the basepoint of Y , so the associated map bf : X!Y I has image in the subspace ÚY ˆ Y I . A homotopy ft : ÖX!Y gives a map F : I \u0002 X \u0002 I!Y taking @I \u0002 X \u0002 I [I \u0002fx0g\u0002 I to the basepoint, with bF a map X \u0002 I!ÚY ˆ Y I deﬁning a basepoint-preserving homotopy bft . The Compact-Open Topology Appendix 531 Proof: (a) For —f ; y– 2 XY \u0002 Y let U ˆ X be an open neighborhood of f—y– . Since Y is locally compact, continuity of f implies there is a compact neighborhood K ˆ Y of y such that f—K– ˆ U . Then M—K; U –\u0002 K is a neighborhood of —f ; y– in XY \u0002 Y taken to U by e ,so e is continuous at —f ; y– . (b) Suppose f : Y \u0002 Z!X is continuous. To show continuity of bf it sufﬁces to show that for a subbasic set M—K; U – ˆ XY , the set bf −1( M—K; U –\u0001 …f z 2 Z j f—K; z– ˆ U g is open in Z . Let z 2 bf −1( M—K; U –\u0001 . Since f −1—U– is an open neighborhood of the compact set K \u0002fzg , there exist open sets V ˆ Y and W ˆ Z whose product V \u0002 W satisﬁes K \u0002fzgˆ V \u0002 W ˆ f −1—U– .So W is a neighborhood of z in bf −1( M—K; U –\u0001 . (The hypothesis that Y is locally compact is not needed here.) For the converse half of (b) note that f is the composition Y \u0002 Z!Y \u0002 XY !X of 11\u0002 bf and the evaluation map, so part (a) gives the result. tu Proposition A.15. If X is a compactly generated Hausdorff space and Y is locally compact, then the product topology on X \u0002 Y is compactly generated. Proof: First a preliminary observation: A function f : X \u0002 Y!Z is continuous iff its restrictions f : C \u0002 Y!Z are continuous for all compact C ˆ X . For, using (b) of the previous proposition, the ﬁrst statement is equivalent to bf : X!Z Y being continuous and the second statement is equivalent to bf : C!Z Y being continuous for all compact C ˆ X . Since X is compactly generated, the latter two statements are equivalent. To prove the proposition we just need to show the identity map X \u0002 Y!—X \u0002 Y–c is continuous. By the previous paragraph, this is equivalent to continuity of the in- clusion maps C \u0002 Y!—X \u0002 Y–c for all compact C ˆ X . Since Y is locally compact, it is compactly generated, and C is compact Hausdorff hence locally compact, so the same reasoning shows that continuity of C \u0002 Y!—X \u0002 Y–c is equivalent to continuity of C \u0002 C 0!—X \u0002 Y–c for all compact C 0 ˆ Y . But on the compact set C \u0002 C 0 , the two topologies on X \u0002 Y agree, so we are done. (This proof is from [Dugundji 1966].) tu Proposition A.16. The map XY \u0002 Z!—XY –Z , f , bf , is a homeomorphism if Y is locally compact Hausdorff and Z is Hausdorff. Proof: First we show that a subbasis for XY \u0002 Z is formed by the sets M—A\u0002 B; U – as A and B range over compact sets in Y and Z respectively and U ranges over open sets in X . Given a compact K ˆ Y \u0002 Z and f 2 M—K; U – , let KY and KZ be the projections of K onto Y and Z . Then KY \u0002 KZ is compact Hausdorff, hence normal, so for each point k 2 K there are compact sets Ak ˆ Y and Bk ˆ Z such that Ak \u0002 Bk is a compact neighborhood of k in f −1—U– \\ —KY \u0002 KZ – . By compactness of K a ﬁnite number of the products Ak \u0002 Bk cover K . Discarding the others, we then have f 2 Tk M—Ak \u0002 Bk;U– ˆ M—K; U – , which shows that the sets M—A\u0002 B; U – form a subbasis. Under the bijection XY \u0002 Z!—XY – Z these sets M—A\u0002 B; U – correspond to the sets M—B; M—A; U–– , so it will sufﬁce to show the latter sets form a subbasis for —XY –Z .We 532 Appendix The Compact-Open Topology show more generally that XY has as a subbasis the sets M—K; V – as V ranges over a subbasis for X and K ranges over compact sets in Y , assuming that Y is Hausdorff. Given f 2 M—K; U – , write U as a union of basic sets U\u000b with each U\u000b an in- tersection of ﬁnitely many sets V\u000b;j of the given subbasis. The cover of K by the open sets f −1—U\u000b– has a ﬁnite subcover, say by the open sets f −1—Ui– . Since K is compact Hausdorff, hence normal, we can write K as a union of compact subsets Ki with Ki ˆ f −1—Ui– . Then f lies in M—Ki;Ui– … M—Ki; T j Vij– … T j M—Ki;Vij– for each i . Hence f lies in Ti;j M—Ki;Vij– … T i M—Ki;Ui– ˆ M—K; U – . Since T i;j M—Ki;Vij– is a ﬁnite intersection, this shows that the sets M—K; V – form a subbasis for —XY –Z . tu Proposition A.17. If f : X!Y is a quotient map then so is f \u0002 11: X \u0002 Z!Y \u0002 Z whenever Z is locally compact. This can be applied when Z … I to show that a homotopy deﬁned on a quotient space is continuous. Proof: Consider the diagram at the right, where W is Y \u0002 Z XZ W Y g h f ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡!¡¡¡¡¡¡!£ Z£ £ 11 with the quotient topology from X \u0002 Z , with g the quotient map and h the identity. Every open set in Y \u0002 Z is open in W since f \u0002 11 is continuous, so it will sufﬁce to show that h is continuous. Since g is continuous, so is the associated map bg : X!W Z , by Proposition A.14. This implies that bh : Y!W Z is continuous since f is a quotient map. Applying Propo- sition A.14 again, we conclude that h is continuous. tu Books J. F. Adams, Algebraic Topology: a Student’s Guide, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1972. J. F.
